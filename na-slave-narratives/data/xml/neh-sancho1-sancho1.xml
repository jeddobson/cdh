        <p>THE Editor of these Letters thinks proper to obviate an objection, which she finds has already been suggested, that they were originally written with a view to publication. She declares, therefore, that no such idea was ever expressed by Mr. Sancho; and that not a single letter is here printed from any duplicate preserved by himself, but all have been collected from the various friends to whom they were addressed. Her motives for laying
<pb id="pii" n="ii"/>
them before the publick were, the desire of shewing that an untutored African may possess abilities equal to an European; and the still superior motive, of wishing to serve his worthy family. And she is happy in thus publicly acknowledging she has not found the world inattentive to the voice of obscure merit.</p>

        <head>THE LIFE <lb/> OF <lb/> IGNATIUS SANCHO.</head>
        <epigraph>
          <p>“Quamvis ille niger, quamvis tu candidus effes.” <lb/> VIRGIL.</p>
        </epigraph>
        <p>THE extraordinary Negro, whose Life I am about to write, was born A. D. 1729, on board a ship in the Slave-trade, a few days after it had quitted the coast of Guinea for the Spanish West-Indies, and, at Carthagena, he received from the hand of the Bishop, Baptism, and the name of Ignatius.</p>
        <pb id="pvi" n="vi"/>
        <p>A disease of the new climate put an early period to his mother's existence; and his father defeated the miseries of slavery by an act of suicide.</p>
        <p>At little more than two years old, his master brought him to England, and gave him to three maiden sisters, resident at Greenwich; whose prejudices had unhappily taught them, that African ignorance was the only security for his obedience, and that to enlarge the mind of their slave would go near to emancipate his person. The petulance of their disposition surnamed him Sancho, from a fancied resemblance to the 'Squire of Don Quixote.</p>
        <p>But a patron was at hand, whom Ignatius Sancho had merit enough to conciliate at a very early age.</p>
        <pb id="pvii" n="vii"/>
        <p>The late Duke of Montagu lived on Blackheath: he accidentally saw the little Negro, and admired in him a native frankness of manner as yet unbroken by servitude, and unrefined by education—he brought him frequently home to the Duchess, indulged his turn for reading with presents of books, and strongly recommended to his mistresses the duty of cultivating a genius of such apparent fertility.</p>
        <p>His mistresses, however, were inflexible, and even threatened on angry occasions to return Ignatius Sancho to his African slavery. The love of freedom had increased with years, and began to beat high in his bosom.—Indignation, and the dread of constant reproach arising from the detection of an amour, infinitely criminal in the eyes of
<pb id="pviii" n="viii"/>
three Maiden Ladies, finally determined him to abandon the family.</p>
        <p>His noble patron was recently dead.—Ignatius flew to the Duchess for protection, who dismissed him with reproof.—He retired from her presence in a state of despondency and stupefaction.</p>
        <p>Enamoured still of that liberty, the scope of whose enjoyment was now limited to his last five shillings, and resolute to maintain it with life, he procured and old pistol for purposes which his father's example had suggested as familiar, and had sanctified as hereditary.</p>
        <p>In this frame of mind the futility of remonstrance was obvious. The Duchess secretly admired his character;
<pb id="pix" n="ix"/>
and at length consented to admit him into her <sic corr="household,">houshold,</sic> where he remained as butler till her death, when he found himself, by her Grace's bequest and his own oeconomy, possessed of seventy pounds in money, and an annuity of thirty.</p>
        <p>Freedom, riches, and leisure, naturally led a disposition of African texture into indulgences; and that which dissipated the mind of Ignatius completely drained the purse. In his attachment to women, he displayed a profuseness which not unusually characterizes the excess of the passion.—Cards had formerly seduced him, but an unsuccessful contest at cribbage with a Jew, who won his cloaths, had determined him to abjure the propensity which appears to be innate among his countrymen.—A French
<pb id="px" n="x"/>
writer relates, that in the kingdoms of Ardrah, Whydah, and Benin, a Negro will stake at play his fortune, his children, and his liberty. Ignatius loved the theatre to such a point of enthusiasm, that his last shilling went to Drury-Lane, on Mr. Garrick's representation of Richard.—He had been even induced to consider the stage as a resource in the hour of adversity, and his complexion suggested an offer to the manager of attempting Othello and Oroonoko; but a defective and incorrigible articulation rendered it abortive.</p>
        <p>He turned his mind once more to service, and was retained a few months by the Chaplain at Montagu-house. That roof had been ever auspicious to him; and the present Duke soon placed him
<pb id="pxi" n="xi"/>
about his person, where habitual regularity of life led him to think of a matrimonial connexion, and he formed one accordingly with a very deserving young woman of West-Indian origin.</p>
        <p>Towards the close of the year 1773, repeated attacks of the gout and a constitutional corpulence rendered him incapable of farther attendance in the Duke's family.</p>
        <p>At this crisis, the munificence which had protected him through various vicissitudes did not fail to exert itself; with the result of his own frugality, it enabled him and his wife to settle themselves in a shop of grocery, where mutual and rigid industry decently maintained a numerous family of children, and where a life of domestic virtue
<pb id="pxii" n="xii"/>
engaged private patronage, and merited public imitation.</p>
        <p>In December, 1780, a series of complicated disorders destroyed him.</p>
        <p>Of a Negro, a Butler, and a Grocer, there are but slender anecdotes to animate the page of the biographer; but it has been held necessary to give some sketch of the very singular man, whose letters, with all their imperfections on their head, are now offered to the public.</p>
        <p>The display those writings exhibit of epistolary talent, of rapid and just conception, of wild <sic corr="patriotism,">pariotism,</sic> and of universal <sic corr="philanthropy,">philanhropy,</sic> may well apologize for the
<pb id="pxiii" n="xiii"/>
protection of the great, and the friendship of the literary.</p>
        <p>The late Duchesses of Queensberry and Northumberland pressed forward to serve the author of them. The former intrusted to his reformation a very unworthy <sic corr="favourite">favoutite</sic> of his own complexion.—Garrick and Sterne were well acquainted with Ignatius Sancho.</p>
        <p>A commerce with the Muses was supported amid the trivial and momentary interruptions of a shop; the Poets were studied, and even imitated with some success;—two pieces were constructed for the stage;—the Theory of Music was discussed, published, and dedicated to the Princess Royal;—and Painting was so much within the circle of Ignatius Sancho's judgement and
<pb id="pxiv" n="xiv"/>
criticism, that Mortimer came often to consult him.</p>
        <p>Such was the man whose species philosophers and anatomists have endeavoured to degrade as a deterioration of the human; and such was the man whom Fuller, with a benevolence and quaintness of phrase peculiarly his own, accounteth
<q type="text" direct="unspecified"><p>“God's Image, though cut in Ebony.”</p></q>
To the harsh definition of the naturalist, oppressions political and legislative have been added; and such are hourly aggravated towards this unhappy race of men by vulgar prejudice and popular insult. To combat these on commercial principles, has been the labour of Labat, Ferman, and Bennezet—such an effort here would be an impertinent digression.</p>
        <pb id="pxv" n="xv"/>
        <p>Of those who have speculatively visited and described the slave-coast, there are not wanting some who extol the mental abilities of the natives. D'Elbée, Moore, and Bosman, speak highly of their mechanical powers and indefatigable industry. Desmarchais does not scruple to affirm, that their ingenuity rivals the Chinese.</p>
        <p>He who could penetrate the interior of Africa, might not improbably discover negro arts and polity, which could bear little analogy to the ignorance and grossness of slaves in the sugar-islands, expatriated in infancy, and brutalized under the whip and the task-master.</p>
        <p>And he who surveys the extent of intellect to which Ignatius Sancho had attained by self-education,
<pb id="pxvi" n="xvi"/>
will perhaps conclude, that the perfection of the reasoning faculties does not depend on a peculiar conformation of the scull or the colour of a common integument, in defiance of that wild opinion, “which,” says a learned writer of these times, “restrains the operations of the mind to particular regions, and supposes that a luckless mortal may be born in a degree of latitude too high or too low for wisdom or for wit.”</p>

          <opener><salute>TO MR. J— W——E.</salute>
<dateline>Charles Street, Feb. 14, 1768.</dateline>
<salute>MY WORTHY AND MUCH RESPECTED FRIEND,</salute></opener>
          <p>POPE observes,</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>“Men change with fortune, manners change with climes;</l>
            <l>“Tenets with books, and principles with times.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>YOUR friendly letter convinced me that you are still the same—and gave in that conviction a ten-fold pleasure:—you carried out (through God's grace) an honest friendly heart, a clear discerning head, and a soul impressed with every humane feeling.—That you are still the same—I repeat it—gives me more joy—than the certainty would of
<pb id="p2" n="2"/>
your being worth ten Jaghires:—I dare say you will ever remember that the truest worth is that of the mind—the blest rectitude of the heart—the conscience unsullied with guilt—the undaunted noble eye, enriched with innocence, and shining with social glee—peace dancing in the heart—and health smiling in the face.—May these be ever thy companions!—and for riches, you will ever be more than vulgarly rich—while you thankfully enjoy—and gratefully assist the wants (as far as you are able) of your fellow creatures. But I think (and so will you) that I am preaching. I only meant in truth to thank you, which I most sincerely do, for your kind letter:—believe me, it gratifies a better principle than vanity—to know that you remember your dark-faced friend at such a distance; but what would have been your feelings—could you have beheld your worthy, thrice worthy father—joy sitting triumphant in his honest face—speeding from house to house amongst his numerous friends,
<pb id="p3" n="3"/>
with the pleasing testimonials of his son's love and duty in his hands—every one congratulating him, and joining in good wishes—while the starting tear plainly proved that over-joy and grief give the same livery?</p>
          <p>You met with an old acquaintance of mine, Mr. G——. I am glad to hear he is well; but when I knew him he was young, and not so <hi rend="italics">wife</hi> as <hi rend="italics">knowing:</hi> I hope he will take example by what he sees in you—and you, young man, remember, if ever you should unhappily fall into bad company, that example is only the fool's plea, and the rogue's excuse, for doing <hi rend="italics">wrong</hi> things:—you have a turn for reflection, and a steadiness, which, aided by the best of social dispositions, must make your company much coveted, and your person loved.—Forgive me for presuming to dictate, when I well know you have many friends much more able from knowledge and better sense—though I deny—a better will.</p>
          <pb id="p4" n="4"/>
          <p>You will of course make Men and Things your study—their different genius, aims, and passions:—you will also note climes, buildings, soils, and products, which will be neither tedious nor unpleasant. If you adopt the rule of writing every evening your remarks on the past day, it will be a kind of friendly <hi rend="italics">téte-a-téte</hi> between you and yourself, wherein you may sometimes happily become your own Monitor;—and hereafter those little notes will afford you a rich fund, whenever you shall be inclined to re-trace past times and places.——I say nothing upon the score of Religion—for, I am clear, every good affection, every sweet sensibility, every heart-felt joy—humanity, politeness, charity—all, all, are streams from that sacred spring;—so that to say you are good-tempered, honest, social, &amp;c. &amp;c. is only in fact saying you live according to your DIVINE MASTER's rules, and are a Christian.</p>
          <p>Your B—— friends are all well, excepting the good Mrs. C——, who is at
<pb id="p5" n="5"/>
this time but so, so. Miss C—— still as agreeable as when you knew her, if not more so. Mr. R——, as usual, never so happy, never so gay, nor so much in true pleasure, as when he is doing good—he enjoys the hope of your well-doing as much as any of your family. His brother John has been lucky—his abilities, address, good nature, and good sense, have got him a surgeoncy in the <sic corr="battalion">batalion</sic> of guards, which is reckoned a very good thing.</p>
          <p>As to news, what we have is so incumbered with <sic corr="falsehoods,">falshoods,</sic> I think it, as Bobadil says, “a service of danger” to meddle with: this I know for truth, that the late great Dagon of the people has totally lost all his worshipers, and walks the streets as unregarded as Ignatius Sancho, and I believe almost as poor—such is the stability of popular greatness:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“One self-approving hour whole years outweighs</l>
            <l>“Of idle starers, or of loud huzza's,” &amp;c.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Your brother and sister C—d sometimes look in upon us; her boys are fine, well, and thriving; and my honest
<pb id="p6" n="6"/>
cousin Joe increases in sense and stature; he promises to be as good, as clever. He brought me your first letter, which, though first wrote, had the fate to come last: the little man came from Red-Lion-Court to Charles Street by himself, and seemed the taller for what he had done; he is indeed a sweet boy, but I fear every body will be telling him so. I know the folly of so doing, and yet am as guilty as any one.</p>
          <p>There is sent out in the Besborough, along with fresh governors, and other strange commodities, a little Blacky, whom you must either have seen or heard of; his name is S——. He goes out upon a rational well-digested plan, to settle either at Madrass or Bengal, to teach fencing and riding—he is expert at both. If he should chance to fall in your way, do not fail to give the rattle-pate what wholesome advice you can; but remember, I do strictly caution you against lending him money upon any account, for he has every thing but—principle; he will never pay you; I

          <p>LORD! what is Man?—and what business have such lazy, lousy, paltry beings of a day to form friendships, or to make connexions? Man is an absurd animal—yea, I will ever maintain it—in his vices, dreadful—in his few virtues, silly—religious without devotion—philosophy without wisdom—the divine passion (as it is called) love too oft without affection—and anger without cause—friendship without reason—hate without reflection—knowledge (like Ashley's punch in small quantities) without judgement—and wit without discretion.—Look into old age, you will see avarice joined to poverty—<sic corr="lechery,">letchery,</sic> gout, impotency, like three monkeys, or London bucks, in a one-horse whisky, driving to the Devil.—Deep politicians
<pb id="p9" n="9"/>
with palsied heads and relaxed nerves—zealous in the great cause of national welfare and public virtue—but touch not—oh! touch not the pocket—friendship—religion—love of country—excellent topics for declamation!—but most ridiculous chimera to suffer either in money or ease—for, trust me, my M——, I am resolved upon a reform.—Truth, fair Truth, I give thee to the wind!—Affection, get thee hence! Friendship, be it the idol of such silly chaps, with aching heads, strong passions, warm hearts, and happy talents, as of old used to visit Charles Street, and now abideth in fair G—h House.</p>
          <p>I give it under my hand and mark, that the best recipe for your aching head (if not the only thing which will relieve you) is cutting off your hair—I know it is not the <hi rend="italics">ton;</hi> but when ease and health stand on the right—ornament and fashion on the left—it is by no means the Ass between two loads of hay—why not ask counsel about it? Even the young part of the faculty were formerly obliged to
<pb id="p10" n="10"/>
submit to amputation, in order to look wise.—What they sacrificed to appearances, do thou to necessity.—Absalom had saved his life, but for his hair. You will reply, “Cæfar would have been drowned, but his length of hair afforded hold to the friendly hand that drew him to shore.” Art, at this happy time, imitates Nature so well in both sexes, that in truth our own growth is but of little consequence. Therefore, my dear M—, part with your hair and head-achs together;—and let us see you spruce, well shorn, easy, gay, <sic corr="debonair">debonnair</sic>—as of old.</p>
          <p>I have made enquiry after L——'s letter. My friend R—— went to demand the reason for omitting to publish it, and to reclaim the copy. The publisher smiled at him, and bid him examine the M. C. of J. 13, where he would find L. and the same paper of the 20th instant, where he would also find P—— B——'s very angry answer.—Indeed the poor fellow foams again, and appears as indecently dull as malice could wish him.
<pb id="p11" n="11"/>
I went to the coffee-house to examine the file, and was greatly pleased upon the second reading of your work, in which is blended the Gentleman and the Scholar. Now, observe, if you dare to say I flatter, or mean to flatter, you either impeach my judgement or honesty—at your peril then be it.—For your letter of yesterday, I could find in my conscience not to thank you for it—it gave a melancholy tint to every thing about me. Pope had the head-ach vilely—Spenser, I have heard, suffered much from it—in short, it is the ail of true geniuses.—They applied a thick wreath of laurel round their brows—do you the same—and, putting the best foot foremost—duly considering the mansion—what it has suffered through chance, time, and hard use—be thankfully resigned, humble, and say, “It is well it is no worse!”</p>
          <p>I do not wish you to be any other than nice in what new acquaintance you make—as to friendship—it is a mistake—real friendships are not hastily made
<pb id="p12" n="12"/>
—friendship is a plant of slow growth, and, like our English oak, spreads, is more majestically beautiful, and increases in shade, strength, and riches, as it increases in years. I pity your poor head, for this confounded scrawl of mine is enough to give the head-ach to the strongest brain in the kingdom—so remember I quit the pen unwillingly, having not said half what I meant; but, impelled by conscience, and a due consideration of your ease, I conclude, just wishing you as well as I do my dear self,</p>

          <p>I AM uneasy about your health—I do not like your silence—let some good body or other give me a line, just to say how you are—I will, if I can, see you on Sunday;—it is a folly to like people and call them friends, except they are blest with health and riches.—A very miserable undone poor wretch, who has no portion in this world's goods, but honesty and good-nature in the article of covering, has applied to me.—I do know something of her—no greater crime than poverty and nakedness.—Now, my dear M——, I know you have a persuasive eloquence among the women—try your oratorical powers.—You have many women—and I am sure there must be a great deal of charity amongst them—Mind, we ask no money—only rags

Tell your girls that I will kiss them twice in the same place—troth, a poor reward;—but more than that—I will respect them in my heart, amidst the casual foibles of worldly prejudice and common usage.—I shall look to their charitable hearts, and that shall spread a crown of glory over every transient defect.—.The poor woman brings this

about your abilities for writing—'tis all a humm—you write sense;—and verily, my good friend, he that wishes to do better must be a coxcomb.—You say you was thrown from your horse but once—in my conscience I think once full oft enough—I am glad, however, you escaped so well.—The description of your journey I return you thanks for—it pleased me much—and proved that you looked rather farther than your horse's head.—A young man should turn travel—home—leisure—or employment—all to the one grand end of improving himself:—from your account of Dalkeith, I now view it “in my mind's eye” (as Hamlet says) and think it a delightful spot.—I was wrong, I find, in my notions of the Edinburghers—for I judged them the grand patterns for—cleanliness—politeness—and generosity. Your birth-day entertainments made a blaze in our papers, which said, amongst other things, that the puncheons of rum stood as thick in your park as the trees—oh! how I licked my lips, and

Dr. James, thy favorite, twice came here;—at his first visit he gave no hope—the next day he came, and poor Pat had resigned up his spirit two hours before he got here;—his Grace paid him the tribute, the rich tribute, of many tears—and ordered me to get a lodging for his widow and children:—in the evening he ordered me to

Her Grace, I am truly sorry to say it, has been but poorly for some

She is very well, and rules over us not with an iron sceptre—but a golden one—we tell her we love her too well—in truth I can never return her a tithe of the kindnesses she has shewn my family—but what's all this to you?—I shall tire you with a jargon of nonsense, therefore I shall only with you all many happy returns of this season—good stomachs—good cheer—and good fires.—My kind remembrance to Madam Tilda—tell her, if she's a good girl, I will try to recommend her to Mr. G—— the painter, for a wife;—he is really, I believe, a first rate genius—and, what's better, he is a good young man—and I flatter myself will do honor to his science and credit to his friends.

<salute>MY DEAR FRIEND,</salute></opener>
          <p>NOTHING could possibly be more welcome than the favor of your truly obliging letter, which I received the day before yesterday.—Know, my worthy young man—that it's the pride of my heart when I reflect that, thro' the favor of Providence, I was the humble means of good to so worthy an object.—May you live to be a credit
<pb id="p38" n="38"/>
to your great and good friends, and a blessing and comfort to your honest parents!—May you, my child, pursue, through God's mercy, the right paths of humility, candour, temperance, benevolence—with an early piety, gratitude, and praise to the Almighty Giver of all your good—gratitude—and love for the noble and generous benefactors his providence has so kindly moved in your behalf; ever let your actions be such as your own heart can approve—always think before you speak, and pause before you act—always suppose yourself before the eyes of Sir William—and Mr. Garrick.—To think justly—is the way to do rightly—and by that means you will ever be at peace within.—I am happy to hear Sir W—— cares so much about your welfare—his character is great—because it is good;—as to your noble friend Mr. Garrick—his virtues are above all praise—he has not only the best head in the world, but the best heart also;—he delights in doing good.—Your father and mother called on me last week, to
<pb id="p39" n="39"/>
shew me a letter which Mr. Garrick has wrote to you—keep it, my dear boy, as a treasure beyond all price—it would do honor to the pen of a divine—it breathes the spirit of father—friend—and christian!—indeed I know no earthly being that I can reverence so much as your exalted and noble friend and patron Mr. Garrick.—Your father and mother, I told you, I saw lately—they were both well, and their eyes overflowed at the goodness of your noble patrons—and with the honest hope you would prove yourself not unworthy of their kindness.</p>
          <p>I thank you for your kindness to my poor black brethren—I flatter myself you will find them not ungrateful—they act commonly from their feelings:—I have observed a dog will love those who use him kindly—and surely, if so, negroes—in their state of ignorance and bondage will not act less generously, if I may judge them by myself—I should suppose kindness would do any thing with them;—my soul melts at kindness—but the contrary—I own with

to write a starch complimentary letter—and I believe you will think I have flourished rather too much;—here then—I recover my wits—and the first use I make of them is to thank you, in Mrs. Sancho's name, for your friendly enquiries—and to assure you, we both rejoice that you had so pleasant a passage—and that you enjoy your health. We hope also, that your young gallant will repay your humane attentions—with grateful regard—and dutiful attachment.—I beg your pardon, over and over, for my blundering forgetfulness of your kind order—it was occasioned by being obliged to say good-bye.—Taking leave of those we esteem is, in my opinion, unpleasant;—the parting of friends is a kind of temporary mourning. Mrs. Sancho is but indifferent—the hot weather does not befriend her—but time will, I hope;—if true worth could plead an exemption from pain and sickness—Miss L—— and Mrs. Sancho would, by right divine, enjoy the best health—but, God be blessed, there is a reward

This end of the town is fairly Regatta-mad—and the prices they ask are only five shillings each seat.—They are building scaffoldings on Westminster-Hall—and the prayers of all parties is now for a fine evening.—May your evenings be ever fair—and mornings bright! I should have said nights happy—all in God's good time! which, you must be convinced, is the best time.—Lydia mends—she walks a little—we begin to encourage hope.—Kitty is as lively as ever—and almost goes alone—the rest are well.—Mrs. Sancho joins me in

          <argument>
            <p>The outline of a plan for establishing a most respectable body of Seamen, to the number of 20,000, to be ever ready for the manning a fleet upon twelve days notice.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE proposer is humbly of opinion, that his plan is capable of many wholesome improvements, which he thinks would prove no unprofitable study, even to the Lords of the Admiralty.</p>
          <p>Ist, Let the number of seamen, now upon actual service, be each man <sic corr="enrolled">inrolled</sic> upon his Majesty's books, at the rate of 51. <hi rend="italics">per annum</hi> for life; let them also receive the same quarterly, or half yearly, upon personal application.</p>
          <p>IIdly, Let books be opened for them in all his Majesty's different yards and sea ports, and there their dwelling, age, time they have served, &amp;c. to be fairly
<pb id="p112" n="112"/>
entered; each man to bring a certificate from his ship, signed by the captain, or some one he shall please to depute.</p>
          <p>3dly, As an encouragement to his Majesty's service and population at the same time, let there be instituted in each of the ship yards, or ports, &amp;c. of these Kingdoms, a kind of asylum, or house of refuge, for the sons of these honest tars, to be received therein at the age of six years; there to be taught navigation, or after the common school learning, to be bound to such parts of ship-building as they by nature are most inclined to; such as chuse sea service, to be disposed on board his Majesty's ships at fifteen years old, and to be enrolled upon the pension books after ten years faithful service, unless better provided for.</p>
          <p>Might not there be some plan hit on to employ the daughters, as well as sons of poor sailors? Does not our Fisheries (if they should ever happen
<pb id="p113" n="113"/>
to be attended to) open many doors of useful employment for both sexes.</p>
          <p>To defray the above, I would advise the following methods:</p>
          <p>First, The pension of 5<hi rend="italics">l. per</hi> man for 20,000, amounts only to 100,000<hi rend="italics">l.</hi>; let this be taken from the Irish list, it will surely be better employed, than in the present mode for Pensioners of noble blood.</p>
          <p>Secondly, Let the book and office-keepers at the different yards, ports, &amp;c. be collected from under-officers who have served with reputation; it will be a decent retreat for them in the evening of life, and only a grateful reward for past service.</p>
          <p>May some able hand, guided by a benevolent heart, point out and strongly recommend something of this sort, that the honoured name of England may be rescued from the scandalous censure of man-stealing, and from the ingratitude also of letting their preservers perish in the time of peace!</p>

          <p>MY gall has been plentifully stirred—by the barbarity of a set of gentry, who <hi rend="italics">every morning</hi> offend my feelings—in their cruel parade through Charles Street to and from market—they vend potatoes in the day—and thieve in the night season.—A tall lazy villain was bestriding his poor beast (although loaded with two panniers of potatoes at the same time) and another of his companions, was good-naturedly employed in whipping the poor sinking

animal—that the gentleman-rider might enjoy the two-fold pleasure of blasphemy and cruelty—this is a too common evil—and, for the honor of rationality, calls loudly for redress.—I do believe it might be in some measure amended—either by a hint in the papers, of the utility of impressing such vagrants for the king's service—or by laying a heavy tax upon the poor Jack-asses—I prefer the former, both for thy sake and mine;—and, as I am convinced we feel instinctively the injuries of our <hi rend="italics">fellow creatures,</hi> I do insist upon your exercising your talents in behalf of the honest sufferers.—I ever had a kind of sympathetic (call it what you please) for that animal—<hi rend="italics">and do I not love you?</hi>—Before Sterne had wrote them into respect, I had a friendship for them—and many a civil greeting have I given them at casual meetings—what has ever (with me) stamped a kind of uncommon value and dignity upon the long ear'd kind of the species, is, that our Blessed Saviour, in his day of worldly triumph, chose to use that in preference

to the rest of his own blessed creation—“meek and lowly, riding upon an ass.” I am convinced that the general inhumanity of mankind proceeds—first, from the cursed false principle of common education—and, secondly, from a total indifference (if not disbelief) of the Christian faith;—a heart and mind impressed with a firm belief of the Christian tenets, must of course exercise itself in a constant uniform general philanthropy—such a being carries his heaven in his breast—and such be thou! therefore write me a bitter Philippick against the misusers of Jack-asses—it shall honor a column in the Morning Post—and I will bray—bray my thanks to you—thou shalt figure away the champion of poor friendless asses here—and hereafter shalt not be ashamed in the great day of retribution.</p>

          <p>I FEEL myself guilty of an unmannerly neglect—in delaying to give my good Mrs. C—— some account of the little commissions she honored me with.—You must exert your friendly influence, in making my peace with her—not but that I well know mercy has the blest preponderancy in her scale—nor can kindness or mercy be lodged in a fairer breast;—in faith I am scarce half alive—yet what really is alive about me—hungers to hear news from B——: first how Mrs. C—— got down—and her good companion—how her health is; tell her, I hope she left all her pains behind her—if so, I believe I

God forgive me, I had almost sworn.—Tell me how the ladies got down—how they do?—and what they do?—how you do?—and how——feels, now the broom is hung on his door-top.—The certainty that B—— and its connexions are all alive and merry—will be a cure for my gout—and thou shalt be sole doctor—as well as first friend to thy ever obliged true friend,</p>

          <p>I DENY it—that I ought to have acknowledged your favour two weeks ago I confess—but my silence was not so long—nor broad—nor rusty—nor fusty as yours.—Blithe health—festive hours
<pb id="p155" n="155"/>
—and social mirth—be thine, my friend!—thy letter, though late, was truly welcome—it unbended the brow of care—and suspended, for some hours, disagreeable thoughts.——By St. Radagunda! quoth I—(ramming my nostrils with Hardham) he has catched the mantle.—Alas, poor Yorick! oh! that thou hadst, by divine permission, been suffered a little—little longer, amongst the moon struck children of this namby-pamby world:—Father of light and life! thy will be done;—but surely—half the wit—half the good sense—of this present age—were interred in Sterne's grave;—his broad philanthropy—like the soul cheering rays of the blessed Sun, invested his happy spirit, and soared into Heaven with it—where, in progressive rise from bliss to bliss, he drinks-in large draughts of rapture, love, and knowledge, and chants the praises of redeeming love, with joy—unbounded and unceasing vigour.—Your invocation has mounted me, Merry Andrew like, upon stilts.—I ape you as monkeys ape men, by walking

upon two.—That you have recovered the true tone of your health and spirits, I rejoice—to be happy in <sic corr="despite">despight</sic> of fortune shews the Philosopher—the Hero—the Christian.—I must confess, my fortitude (which is wove of very flimsy materials) too oft gives way in the rough and unfriendly jostles of life:—Madam Fortune, who by the way is a bunter—(and such I love not) has been particularly cross and untoward to me since you left us—they say she is fond of fools—'tis false and scandalous—she hates me—and I have the vanity to say and believe—that if folly, sheer folly had any charms—I should stand as fair in her esteem—as A.B. C.D. E.F.—or any of Folly's family through the whole alphabet.—You halted at Burleigh—you did just what I wished you to do—and left it, I trust, as well in health as you entered that sweet mansion—stopp'd at Retford—and found your venerable parents well—and contributed to their happiness—increased their felicity by the many nice little attentions
<pb id="p157" n="157"/>
of filial love—which the good heart delights in—and even angels approve.——And how do the worthy souls of Hull and its environs?—Do they credit themselves by esteeming a good-enough kind of mortal!—You cannot imagine what hold little Billy gets of me—he grows—prattles—every day learns something new—and by his good-will would be ever in the shop with me—the monkey! he clings round my legs—and if I chide him or look sour—he holds up his little mouth to kiss me;—I know I am the fool—for parents weakness is child's strength:—truth orthodox—which will hold good between lover and lovee—as well as—————. Mrs. Sancho and her virgins are so, so—Mrs. Sancho—the virgins—well as youth and innocence—souls void of care and consciences of offence can be.—Dame Sancho would be better if she cared less.—I am her barometer—if a sigh escapes me, it is answered by a tear in her eye;—I oft assume a gaiety to illume her dear sensibility with a smile

          <p>WITH the old story of the Season, &amp;c. &amp;c. most sincerely, and amen.</p>
          <p>When Royal David—in the intoxication of success—and fullness of pride—imprudently insisted upon the numbering of his people—we are told, the Prophet was sent to announce the Divine displeasure—and to give him the choice of one of the three of the Almighty's heaviest punishments:—in his choice—he shewed both wisdom and true piety—you know the rest.—Now my friend—thou knowest my weakness;—I sincerely believe the Sacred Writ—
<pb id="p166" n="166"/>
and of course look upon war in all its horrid arrangements as the bitterest curse that can fall upon a people—and this American one—as one of the very worst—of worst things;—that it is a just judgement, I do believe—that the eyes of our rulers are shut—and their judgements stone-blind—I believe also.—The Gazette will give you a well-drest melancholy account—but you will see one thing in it which you will like—and that is, the humane solicitude of General Burgoyne—for the safety and good treatment indiscriminately of all his camp-artificers and attendants;—he is certainly a man of feeling—and I regard him more for the grandeur of his mind in adversity—than I should in all the triumphal pomp of military madness.—But let me return, if possible, to my senses;—for God's sake! what has a poor starving <sic corr="Negro,">Negroe,</sic> with six children, to do with kings and heroes, and armies and politics?—aye, or poets and painters?—or artists—of any sort? quoth Monsieur S——. True—indubitably
<pb id="p167" n="167"/>
true.—For your letter, thanks—it should have come sooner—better late, &amp;c. &amp;c.—What have I to do with your good or evil fortune—health or sickness—weal or woe?—I am resolved, from henceforth, to banish feelings—Misanthrope from head to foot!—<hi rend="italics">Apropos</hi>—not five minutes since I was interrupted, in this same letter of letters, by a pleasant affair—to a man of no feelings.—A fellow bolted into the shop—with a countenance in which grief and fear struggled for mastery.—“Did you fee any body go to my cart, Sir?”—“No, friend, how should I? you fee I am writing—and how should I be able to fee your cart or you either in the dark?”—“Lord in heaven pity me! cries the man, what shall I do? oh! what shall I do?—I am undone!—Good God!—I did but go into the court here—with a trunk for the lady at Captain G——'s (I had two to deliver) and somebody has stole the other;—what shall I do?—what shall I do?”—“Zounds, man!—who ever left their cart in the night with goods in it, without leaving
<pb id="p168" n="168"/>
some one to watch?”—“Alack, Sir, I left a boy, and told him I would give him something to stand by the cart, and the boy and trunk are both gone!”—Oh nature!—oh heart!—why does the voice of distress so forcibly knock at the door of hearts?—but to hint to pride and avarice—our common kindred—and to alarm self-love.—Mark, I do think, and will maintain it—that self-love alone—if rightly understood, would make man all that a dying Redeemer wills he should be.—But this same stolen trunk;—the ladies are just gone out of my shop—they have been here holding a council—upon law and advertisements;—God help them!—they could not have come to a worse—nor could they have found a stupider or sorrier adviser:—the trunk was seen parding between two in the Park—and I dare say the contents by this time are pretty well gutted.—Last Sunday I met, coming from church, Mr. C——; he looks well, better than when you left him.—I took occasion, as we were prating about
<pb id="p169" n="169"/>
and about your worship—to pin Mr. de Groote's interest upon the skirts of his feelings;—he desired, when I saw him next, I would send him into Crown-street—which I religiously performed—but have not seen Mr. de Groote since;—in truth, there is (<sic corr="despite">despight</sic> of his nose) so much of the remains of better times—somewhat of the gentleman and artist in ruins—something creative of reverence as well as pity—that I have wished to do more than I ought—though at the same time too little for such a being to receive—without insult from the hands of a poor <sic corr="negro">negroe</sic>—(pooh, I do not care for your prancings, I can see you at this distance);—we have agreed upon one thing;—which is, I have undertaken to write to Mr. G—— for him, in the way of local relief;—I will wager a tankard of porter, I succeed—in some sort;—I will aim at both sides of him—his pity and his pride—which, alas!—the last I mean, finds a first-floor in the breast of every son of Adam.—S—— called on me this

day, and left a picture for you at your lodgings—and a very spirited head in miniature, of your own doing, with me—which I like so well—you will find it difficult to get it from me—except you talk of giving me a copy—self-love again.—How can you expect business in these hard times—when the utmost exertions of honest industry can scarce afford people in the middle sphere of life daily provisions?—When it shall please the Almighty that things shall take a better turn in America—when the conviction of their madness shall make them court peace—and the same conviction of our <sic corr="cruelty">cuelty</sic> and injustice induce us to settle all points in equity—when that time arrives, my friend, America will be the grand patron of genius—trade and arts will flourish—and if it shall please God to spare us till that period—we will either go and try our fortunes there—or stay in Old England and talk about it.—While thou hast only one mouth to feed—one back to cloath—and one wicked member to indulge

<salute>SIR,</salute></opener>
          <p>THE Romans were wont to decree public honors on the man who was so fortunate as to save the life of a citizen—a noble act of policy, founded on true humanity, to stimulate the endeavours of every individual towards acts of benevolence, and brotherly regard
<pb id="p179" n="179"/>
for each other. Actuated by zeal to my prince, and love to my country, I mean to deserve well of both, by publishing, through the channel of your paper, a plan for greatly diminishing the national debt, or, in case a war with the House of Bourbon should be inevitable, for raising three or four years supplies, without oppressing the merchant, mechanic, or labouring husbandman; in short, without abridging one needful indulgence, or laying any fellow-subject under the least self-denying restraint.</p>
          <p>Mr. Editor, we all know that in noble families plate is merely ideal wealth—and in very many houses of your first connections and over-grown fortunes, there are vast quantities of it old and useless, kept merely for the antiquity of its fashion, and the ostentatious proof of the grandeur of ancestry. Our neighbours the French (if I mistake not) in the last war, had the spirit (when the  treasures of their Grand Monarque were nearly exhausted) to send their plate
<pb id="p180" n="180"/>
generously to the mint, in aid of national honour and security. Their churchmen have often shewed the laity, the glorious example of aiding the state. We, to our immortal honor, have never yielded them the palm in courage, wisdom, or gallantry. Let every gentleman, whose landed property exceeds 500<hi rend="italics">l. per annum,</hi> give up, without reserve, his useless family plate, all except knives, forks, and spoons, which may be deemed useful and necessary. I trust, such is the exalted spirit of the British nobility and gentry, that they will resign with <sic corr="cheerfulness">chearfulness</sic> what they can so very well do without. Should this meet (as I hope it will) with the <sic corr="cheerful">chearful</sic> assent of the public, let the quantities, so nobly given, be printed against the names of the patriotic donors, as a lasting testimony of their zeal for the public good, and a glorious proof of the internal riches of this queen of isles!</p>

          <p>I AM one of the many who have been often edified by the graceful eloquence and truly Christian doctrine of the unfortunate Dr. Dodd:—as a Divine, he had, and still has, my love and reverence; his faults I regret; but, alas! I feel myself too guilty to cast a stone: Justice has her claims—but—Mercy, the anchor of my hope, inclines me to wish he might meet with Royal clemency—his punishments have already been pretty severe—the loss of Royal favor—the cowardly attacks of malicious buffoonry—and the over-strained zeal for rigid justice in the prosecution.—Oh! would to God the reverend bishops, clergy, &amp;c. would join in petitioning the throne for his life!—it would save the holy order from indignity, and even the land itself from the reproach of making
<pb id="p182" n="182"/>
too unequal distinctions in punishments. He might, by the rectitude of his future life, and due exertion of his matchless powers—be of infinite service—as chaplain to the poor convicts on the river, which would be a punishment, and, at the same time, serve for a proof or test of his contrition—and the sincerity of a zeal he has often manifested (in the pulpit) for the service of true Religion—and he may rise the higher by his late fall—and do more real service to the thoughtless and abandoned culprits, than a preacher, whose character might perhaps be deemed spotless: if this hint should stimulate a pen, or heart, like the good B——p of Chester's, to exert itself in the behalf of a man who has formerly been alive to every act of Heaven-born charity—the writer of this will have joy, even in his last moments, in the reflection that he paid a mite of the vast debt he owes Dr. Dodd as a preacher.</p>

          <p>YOUR short letter gave me much pleasure—which would have been enlarged had your epistle been longer—but I make allowances—as I ought—for the number of friends who wish equally with me—and expect to be gratified. You are greatly fortunate in enjoying your health—for which I doubt not but you are truly thankful to the Almighty Giver.—As to your success, it is the best comment upon your conduct;—for rectitude of principle and humble deportment, added to strict attention and good-nature—must make even fools and knaves wish you well—though envy will mix itself with the transient kindness of such—but with such noble natures as you went out happily

          <p>I say nothing of politics—I hate such subjects;—the public papers will inform you of mistakes—blood—taxes—misery—murder—the obstinacy of a few—and the madness and <sic corr="villainy">villiany</sic> of a many.—I expect a very, very long letter from

and, if old saws say true, we are to expect a continuance of about thirty-seven days good ducking weather;—we will leave it to the all-wise Disposer of events—with this comfortable reflection—that whatever he wills—is best.—We are happy to hear so good an account of the——; she especially, as very likely a good course of fatigue, sweetened with gain, may contribute as much to her health as her pleasure—and re-establish her perfectly.—We have nothing stirring in the news way, or any other way—the town is literally empty, saving a few sharks of both sexes, who are too poor to emigrate to the camps or watering places, and so are forced to prey upon one another in town.—I protest, it is to me the most difficult of things to write to one of your female geniuses—there is a certain degree of cleverality (if I may so call it), an easy kind of derangement of periods, a gentleman-like—fashionable—careless—seesaw of dialogue—which I know no more
<pb id="p196" n="196"/>
of than you do of cruelty.—I write as I think—foolishly—and you write well—why?—because you think well.—So much for praise—compliment—flattery, &amp;c.—My respects attend Mr. B—— and Mrs. S—— and Mrs——; tell Miss A——s, one of us will come to see her—perhaps.—I have received a kind letter from my good friend the doctor—and one also from the surgeon to the guards, dated New York, June 12;—he thinks the commissioners might have saved themselves the trouble—as they are like to come back—just as wife as they went.—The Panton-Street good folks are well for what I know—not having seen them since I last had the honor of addressing Mrs. C——.

Are you the better for your journey? Did the exercise create any amendment of appetite? Was your travelling party agreeable? And how did you find the good couple?—The sweet sensations arising from the sight of those we love, the reviewing the places, either houses, fields, hedges, stiles, or posts of our early morn of life acquaintance, the train of pleasurable ideas awakened, are more salutary than the whole college of grave faces.—Tell me much about yourself—and more about your honored parents,

whom I hope you found as well as you wished—your kindred at Lancaster, to whom my hearty wishes—and to all who have charity enough to admit dark faces into the fellowship of Christians.—Say much for me to your good father and mother—in the article of respect thou canst not exaggerate;—excepting conjugal, there are no attentions so tenderly heart-soothing as the parental.—Amidst the felicity of thy native fields may'st thou find health, and diffuse pleasure round the respectable circle of thy friends!—No news—but that Keppel is in chace of de Chartres.</p>
