        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>There are very few Anti-Slavery books
adapted to the young, yet no field could
furnish a more attractive literature for children
than this. Robinson Crusoe and the Arabian
Nights would seem lifeless and uninteresting
by the side of hundreds of true and simple
narratives which might be written of slave life
in our Southern States. This story of “Aunt
Sally” is, probably, no more remarkable
than multitudes of others; only it has
chanced to come to notice. It is strictly
true in all its incidents. It has not been
embellished, or wrought up for effect, but
<pb id="sallyiv" n="iv"/>
is given, as nearly as possible, in the words in
which it was related to the writer. “Aunt
Sally” is a veritable person, and is now living
in Detroit, Michigan, with her son, Rev. Isaac Williams,
who is pastor of a Methodist church there.</p>
        <p>The portraits in this book have been
engraved from daguerreotypes, which are
faithful likenesses of “Aunt Sally,” her son
and his family.</p>
        <p>The writer hopes that this little story may
be the means of leading those who read it to
think and feel deeply upon the truths which
it involves, and that many more similar
books may be written for our Sabbath
Schools, so that the young may grow up
imbued with the spirit of liberty, and rejoicing to
labor for that
<pb id="sallyv" n="v"/>
oppressed and unhappy race which “Aunt
Sally” represents, so, at length, this unfortunate
be slaves no longer, but shall find that, to
them all, the Cross has been the Way of Freedom.</p>

          <p>SOME twenty-five years ago, in Fayetteville,
North Carolina, a slave boy, named Isaac
Williams, was suddenly told that his mother
had been sold to a speculator, and was going
to Alabama. He loved her with the ardor
of a young heart which had nothing else to
cling to, and when these terrible words fell
on his ear, he sank down, overcome with 
<pb id="sally10" n="10"/>
anguish and dismay. All the past came back to
him, sorrowful indeed, but endurable because
shared with her. His earliest recollections were of
those long days in the rice-fields, when she carried
him securely fastened to her back, with his baby
brother tucked in her dress in front, because she
would not leave them to be neglected in her cabin,
nor lay them down, where snakes might crawl over
them, by the side of the fence. How weary she
must have been, his young mother; for then she
was scarcely seventeen; but yet how kind she
was; how patient when he was tired and fretful!
He thought of the many evenings he had seen her
spinning by the light-wood fire, that she might
have yarn for knitting socks, wherewith to
purchase a jacket or a hat or a pair of shoes for his
Sunday wear, or sewing industriously to make or
mend some needful garment, when so fatigued
with the day's labor that she nodded between the
stitches, and at last sat down in heavy slumber
over her work. He thought of all the prayers she
had offered for him, and of her faithful counsels as
he came to maturer years, He remembered her grief
when his father was sold from her, and yet the
meekness with
<pb id="sally11" n="11"/>
which she yielded to what she could not 
prevent, and the quiet cheerfulness and energy
with which she toiled to provide a comfortable
home for herself and her children when she
had hired her time of her master. All these
and a thousand recollections more flashed
upon his mind as he heard of her fate, and
ran to ask his master's permission to go and
bid her farewell. It was granted, and first
he went to the little home which she had
rented, and where she had earned her living
by the sale of cakes and beer. He opened the
door. All was confusion. The few articles
of furniture, which she had labored so hard
to obtain, were either removed or lying in
disorder about the room. The bright fire
was out, the welcoming voice was silent.
Upon inquiry, he learned that her purchaser
had taken her, with many others, to a 
“wagon-yard,” or, more properly, slave-pen, where
they would be kept securely till he  was ready
to start on his distant journey. Thither he
bent his steps. When he reached the place,
he found that his old grandmother, who lived
several miles farther in the country, had heard
also of her daughter's sale, and had come with
tears and tremblings to bid her adieu.</p>
          <pb id="sally12" n="12"/>
          <p>Can you imagine a scene like this? Can 
you think of your mother, who, dear as she 
is, is no dearer to you than Isaac's was to 
him, torn by brute force from her home, shut 
up in a narrow yard like a wild animal in a
cage, her every look and tear watched by her 
purchaser, who walks about, whip in hand, to 
quell any who may be refractory, and. her 
last agonized words of affection spoken to 
you through a crack in the fence which
guards the enclosure? Yet all this the 
poor boy had to suffer, and his heart was as tender 
as yours.</p>
          <p>What would you do? Would you become 
almost frantic in your grief, and rave wildly 
at the master, and strive to break down the 
bars and release your mother from so terrible 
a captivity? Would you? Then you would 
be guilty of treason and rebellion in the eyes 
of the law, and her owner would be justified 
in imprisoning you—nay, in taking your life 
if he deemed it expedient. Merciful Father! 
pity those whom no man pities, and by thine 
own power elevate those on whom the world 
and the world's law tramples!</p>
          <p>So poor Isaac could only sob as if his heart 
would break, and wonder why he and she
<pb id="sally13" n="13"/>
were ever born (was it strange?) and resolve
with his whole soul, that if God spared his
life, he would one day be free, and seek out
his mother, and redeem her, though she were
sold to a thousand Alabama. Thus they parted.</p>
          <p>The slave-train moved off, and Isaac and
his old grandmother returned to their 
respective masters. How dark seemed the way
to him now. He could no longer anticipate,
as heretofore, a Sunday visit to his mother,
and a treat of cakes and beer. There was no
one to speak an affectionate or encouraging
word to him. Sometimes he was tempted to
he wholly discouraged, but he determined to
rise above such a feeling, and to keep
unchanged his faith in God and his purpose 
of freedom. So several years passed away,
during which he grew to manhood, when a
death occurred in his master's family which 
rendered a division of the property—that is,
to the men and women—necessary, and Isaac
fell to a relative in Mississippi. Farewell to
North Carolina! True, he was still a slave,
but he felt that in some way he was moving
toward liberty, and so gladly over the
mountains and rivers to his untried home.
<pb id="sally14" n="14"/>
He had not been long settled there when, 
in 1833, he married a young colored woman, 
on an adjacent plantation. And now that he 
had a wife and children growing up about 
him, did he lose sight of his early resolution? 
By no means. He was always revolving in
his mind how he should compass his own 
freedom and regain his mother. In 1838, his 
master went to Mobile, and Isaac accompanied 
him as his waiting-man. There was 
then living there a cousin of his mother's, an
intelligent slave woman, named Mary Ann 
Williams. To her he applied, hoping she 
could give him some information. He was 
disappointed; she knew nothing of her cousin's 
fate, but promised to remember her and
as she could write, to communicate to him 
everything she might be able to learn. 
Meanwhile his wife's freedom was purchased by 
her father, and Isaac, hiring his time of his 
master, went to Orleans and worked as a
carpenter until he had gained his own. But 
he did not forget his mother; she was always 
the burden of his thoughts and his prayers. 
How many plans did he make to ascertain 
where she was; how many letters did he 
write to Tuscaloosa and Mobile, and to every
<pb id="sally15" n="15"/>
place where he thought there could be the 
least possibility of gaining the desired 
intelligence! At length, when he had almost 
despaired of success, he received a letter from 
Mary Ann Williams, at Mobile, telling him 
that, by a singular incident, which will be
narrated hereafter, she had learned that his 
mother was living, and owned by a man, 
whose name she gave, in Dallas county, 
Alabama. She was alive then! She had not 
died on the fatiguing journey, nor been beaten 
to death by a cruel overseer, nor allowed 
herself to waste away with grief at her ruthless 
separation from all she loved. He thanked 
God, and wrote to her master, telling him of 
his purpose to redeem her, and asking him 
to name the price at which she would be 
sold. Long he waited for an answer; she 
was doubtless valuable to her owner, and he 
was unwilling to part with her. Again
and again he wrote, but to be disappointed.</p>
          <p>And now Isaac resolved to leave Mississippi. 
He wanted to breathe the free air. 
After various adventures, he at last reached 
the Northern States with his family, and 
finally settled in Detroit, Michigan. <ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">*</ref><note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot " anchored="yes" target="ref1"><p>* The details of Mr. Williams's life are not given,

          <p>YEARS of anxiety and effort and hope 
Deferred went by. At length, in 1852, Isaac
received from his mother's master the
long-desired letter, saying he would sell her to
him for the sum of four hundred dollars. 
But now that the old trouble was over, a 
new fear tormented the faithful son. Was
this woman <hi rend="italics">really his mother?</hi> More than 
twenty years had passed since they were 
separated, and the only evidence he had of 
her existence was the testimony of her cousin 
in Mobile. Slight foundation it seemed upon which
to rest so weighty a matter. Might
it not be merely a plan of her master's to
lure him into the of slavery and
punish him for his free spirit; or else to 
dispose probably of an old and useless servant?
His heart sickened at the thought. He must
be sure that he was right before he went
further, for to be disappointed at last would
be more than he could bear. So he wrote
a letter to the master, asking him to put 
<pb id="sally18" n="18"/>
various questions to her, relative to incidents in his
early life, with which she only was acquainted.</p>
          <p>If your mother had been lost for twenty years, and
you hoped to regain her through
the remembrances or your childhood, how would you
recall the birthday festival, and the prayers for you
beside your little bed when your head was on her
bosom, and the twilight walk through the rose-scented
lanes when she told you a story of her girlish days, and
that sad morning when, for an outbreak of passion,
you fell into disgrace with your father, and she soothed
and calmed you, and gently led you back to the path of
duty and of love! Isaac was a poor slave boy when he
knew a mother's care, but servitude can not crush out
the heart's flowers, and he had remembrances which
were sweet to him, and which he knew would wake a
response in her heart if living she were. How anxiously
did he wait for that letter which would be life or death
to his hopes! It came at last. His questions were more
than answered. Taking up the incidents as he narrated
them, she had gone farther and recalled many things
which he had forgotten, and sent them to him in
<pb id="sally19" n="19"/>
her simple words with messages of affection.</p>
          <p>That night what fervent thanksgiving did he send
up to heaven for the blessed knowledge that he had a
mother—he who had been so friendless in the world; that
she loved and trusted him, and perhaps was even then
supplicating their common Father for her distant son.</p>
          <p>He now set about preparing to raise the money for
her liberation. In March, 1856, he left Detroit,
stopping wherever he had friends, or could make them,
and finally reached New York in early autumn, having
some two hundred and fifty dollars collected.</p>
          <p>After a few weeks in the city and vicinity, he raised
the balance of the amount, and then a new difficulty
arose. How was the money to be transmitted, and his
mother brought North? For experience has shown that
it is a less troublesome and delicate thing to deal with
Japan, and China, and Algiers, than with our Southern
States, when it is desired to give to any of the colored
population their birthright of freedom. Various plans
were proposed and abandoned. At last he went to the
office of Adams's Express Company, to see
<pb id="sally20" n="20"/>
if it could be accomplished through their
means.  They declined doing it directly, but
referred him to a well-known merchant of New
York, as one who would advise and assist him,
and for whom they would willingly undertake the
matter. This gentleman listened to the story, and
going to the Bank of the Republic, which is very
popular at the South, deposited the money there,
and arranged with the officers to have their
correspondent in Selma, Alabama, purchase
the woman and see her, with the requisite papers,
consigned to the care of the Express company.</p>
          <p>The burden of care was now taken from Isaac;
the responsibility rested upon others. He had been
buoyant and full of courage while active exertion
remained, but when that was ended and nothing
was left for him but patient waiting, the very
intensity of his feelings gave birth to fears, and led
him to count the chances for her safe release, and
to brood over every possible disaster. She had
been lost to him for a score of years, and he could
have heard of her death at any time with
comparative resignation, but now that she had
come back to him in blessed resurrection, and the
meeting seemed so near,
<pb id="sally21" n="21"/>
her loss would be like shipwreck to the storm-tossed 
mariner, when just in sight of the
green fields, and the peaceful spire, and the
cottage of love for which his heart had
yearned through all the dreary voyage.
Disturbed and anxious, he went that
evening to his lodgings, and retiring
to rest, was soon lost in uneasy
slumber.</p>
          <p>And he dreamed. Some of his life-scenes
passed before him like the moving 
pictures of a panorama, so real that the present 
was forgotten in the past they restored. He 
saw himself a boy, sitting on the dirt-floor of 
his mother's little cabin at Fayetteville, 
after a hard day's work, and pouring his 
sorrows into her sympathizing ear. He had just 
began to realize who it is to be a slave. He
had been accustomed to play with the master's 
children, and had had many little privileges
about the house, but now that he was old 
enough to labor, he was kept in the field
from dawn till dusk, under the eye of an
overseer who had no leniency for his youth
nor compassion for his fatigue. The poor
mother could not point her boy to a 
brighter lot, so she only said, with a sigh, 
as she drew the “hoe-cake” from the ashes 
for their evening
<pb id="sally22" n="22"/>
meal, “Well, Isaac, you must try and do your
duty by mas'r and the Lord Jesus 'll 
stand by ye. Near as I can find out, He 
had heaps o' trouble all His days.”</p>
          <p>The cabin faded away, and, almost a man in years
and size, he stood by the “slave-pen,” bidding her
farewell before she went to Alabama. With
unutterable grief he turned to depart, but her faith
would not let her go without one word of comfort, so
she called after him, “Keep a good heart, Isaac, and
the Lord help ye! Put your trust in Him and He'll
never leave nor forsake ye. Perhaps we shall see each
other before we die!” This great anguish passed over,
and he was in Louisiana, toiling for his freedom.
Hundreds of dollars had been paid to his master, but
obstacles were constantly thrown in his way, and he
was sometimes on the point of rebellion and despair.
But he thought of his mother, and seemed to hear her
saying, as of old, “Be patient; keep on, and the good
Lord 'll bring it all right one o' dese mornins.” And then
he was a free man in Detroit, and the pastor of a
Methodist church; longing earnestly that his mother
might share the advantages of his position, and feeling
<pb id="sally23" n="23"/>
inspired every day to labor by the remembrance of her
christian virtues. And then he was in the actual
present, and the money had been sent for her
redemption, and he was trembling lest after all, the
scheme might fail, In his dream he cried to heaven, “O
merciful Father! shalt all her faith and trust in Thee be
for nought? Wilt thou not reward the love and service
of sixty years?” And then he thought an angel bent
over him and whispered, “Fear not, thy fidelity and
hers have been chronicled. Wait a little while and thou
shalt clasp thy mother in thine arms.”</p>
          <p>He awoke. The sun was shining brightly into the
room, and having faith now that he was soon to meet
her, he rose and prepared to leave New York for a little
while, in order to raise the money necessary to defray
their expenses till they should reach Detroit.</p>

          <p>HAVING thus far followed the son, let us leave
him among his Northern friends, and return to trace
the history of the mother.</p>
          <p>About the year 1796, (a slave's precise age is a
matter of conjecture,) in a small cabin on a plantation
not many miles from Fayetteville, North Carolina, a
little colored girl was born. There were no great
rejoicings when she came into the world. Her parents
had been all their lives in servitude, and knew no higher
pleasures than it afforded, but they felt, despite their
ignorance, that their days passed wearily, and it was
no joy to them to rear children for the same fate. No
dainty wardrobe was ready for her use; no tiny caps
nor embroidered dress, nor soft flannel blanket, but
with her midnight earnings the mother had purchased
two frocks of cheap print, to which her mistress had
added one of her own
<pb id="sally26" n="26"/>
children's cast-off dresses; and in this coarse apparel
the little Sally, for so she was called, rolled about and
stretched her chubby limbs as complacently as if she
had been enveloped in a princess' lace and linen.</p>
          <p>In a few weeks the mother returned to her labor in
the field, and Sally was placed with old “Aunt Katy,”
who had charge of all the children on the plantation.
At night, when the tasks were done, her mother took
her to her own dwelling, returning her in the morning to
the nurse. So she passed through babyhood
and grow into a stout little girl, running about the cabin
and over the grounds, as unconscious of her relations
to life as the dog with which she played, or the bird
that sang in the old sycamore above the door. No
pains were taken to develop anything but her animal
nature—no one taught her to lisp the name of God,
or to trace His hand in every object which surrounded
her, or to regard His holy law in her daily life. Why
should they? She was only a piece of property! Her
mother, although possessed of more than ordinary
intelligence and energy, was not then a religious
woman. In spite of her hard labor, she managed to
keep her cabin in better
<pb id="sally27" n="27"/>
order, and her children more comfortably clad than
most of the other servants; indeed, so full of life and
spirit was she, that when the toilsome week was over,
none enjoyed more highly the Saturday-evening dance or
the Sunday holiday. She was a good mother, as far as
she knew, and trained her children to habits of
industry and activity. Speaking of those days, Aunt
Sally said: “I tell you how my mother done me—she
whipped me when I didn't work to please her, but 't
was the gloriousest thing!”</p>
          <p>The master required but
little work of the child. It is policy to leave the slaves
to grow and strengthen, unfatigued by labor, until they
are old enough to be constantly occupied, as a colt is
loft unshackled, with free range of the pastures, until
the “breaking” time comes. When about nine years
old, Sally began to be employed in doing errands for
her mistress, in sweeping the leaves from the walks, and
in weeding the garden. She was full of fun and
frolic, but she meant to be a good girl, and whenever
she was blamed for any thing, although she tried to
escape the threatened whipping, yet she was careful 
not to be guilty of the same offense again. There 
was a little girl, named Mary, about her own age
<pb id="sally28" n="28"/>
who shared all her tasks. Rare play-fellows 
they were—talking and singing and running about
together from morning till night. One bright day in
Sally's tenth summer, Mary suddenly sickened
and died. So full of life when the still arose—so
silent, so motionless, when it went down! It was
the first bereavement Sally had ever known, and she was
almost frantic in her grief. No one told her of
death's brighter meaning; she saw only its
sternness and gloom. Throwing herself beside the
unconscious child, and sleeping only at
momentary intervals, she consumed the night in 
calling upon her name, and when morning came, 
she went to the garden, and, gathering the choicest 
flowers, placed them in her hand, as if death 
were an ugly dream which daylight and bloom
would scare away. So the weary hours went
by, and when at evening preparations were
made for the funeral, she begged to be allowed
to join the procession. How strange and
solemn it seemed as all the servants of the
household, bearing lighted torches, walked
two by two, through the forest path to the
burying-ground, preceded by the preacher,
singing these dirge-like words—
<pb id="sally29" n="29"/>
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Bear her gently, calm and slow,</l><l>To the home where she must go: </l><l>One by one we'll follow on,</l><l>By and by we'll all be gone </l><l>Over Jordan.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Deep within the pine tree's shade</l><l>Has her quiet grave been made;</l><l>Sleeping here and sleeping there,</l><l>We shall meet from everywhere</l><l>Over Jordan.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Now we leave her to her rest;</l><l>Jesus! Savior! ever blest, </l><l>Take us soon from earth's alarms, </l><l>Safe within Thy sheltering arms </l><l>Over Jordan!”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <p>The little coffin was lowered, the earth was thrown
upon it, and with another wailing song the party
returned. But Sally did not forget.</p>
          <p>It was a balmy day in October. The fervid heats of
Summer were over, and there was a refreshing
coolness in the air. The garden was gay with 
autumn flowers, and every waft of wind that went over
the trees, bore to the ground the broad leaves of the
sycamore to rest upon the myriad needles of the pine.
In one of the paths stood Sally, broom in
<pb id="sally30" n="30"/>
hand, busy in removing them as they fell.
She looked up and saw, approaching, her young master, a
handsome youth, elegantly attired, and having in his
face, and manner a certain reckless frankness which
defied the judgment and straightway won the heart.
Sally's quickness pleased him, and he often stopped to
exchange a kind word with her.</p>
          <p>“This wind keeps you busy, eh, Sally?” </p>
          <p>“Yes, Mas'r. Don't more'n got 'em swept away
'fore down they comes agin.”</p>
          <p>“Is that what makes you look so sober?”</p>
          <p>“No. Mas'r. I's thinkin' 'bout Mary, an' wonderin
whar she is, 'cause the preacher said, when they put
her in the ground, she'd gone ober Jordan, an' we must
all got religion an' follow on arter, an' 'pears like I
dunno 'xactly what he meant.”</p>
          <p>“Now, Sally, don't you believe any such canting
nonsense. When we die, that's the end of us; 
there's no hereafter. Look here,”—and as he
spoke he trod one of the yellow sycamore leaves into
the earth—“see this leaf! In a few days it will be
crumbled into dust; it's so with us when we die, and
that is all.”</p>
          <p>“But, Mas'r, I thought mebbe we might
<pb id="sally31" n="31"/>
come up out of the ground sometime, like the flowers
do in the spring.”</p>
          <p>“O, no, Sally, I tell you there's nothing 
after death. Don't bother yourself with such 
things,” and he sauntered down the walk, 
and was soon out of sight under the arching
trees. Just then a shower of leaves 
came pattering to the earth. Poor Sally sighed 
as she thought of their swift decay, and wondered 
if “young Mas'r,” who was an oracle 
in her eyes, were right, and resolved that at
least she would take his advice, and trouble 
herself no more about the matter.</p>
          <p>She was now employed to carry every day to the
field-hands their dinner. It was a long walk 
that she had to take across the pastures, 
with the bread and meat and boiled rice, 
borne in a large wooden bowl upon her head. 
A fence lay in her way, and one day, in 
climbing it, the bowl was upset and the 
provisions strewn upon the grass. In a tremor 
of fear she replaced them in the bowl and 
hastened on. Her delay was noticed, and the 
overseer coming up to her, whip in hand, 
demanded its cause. When he discovered 
some grains of sand sticking to the rice, she 
confessed the whole and begged him to 
<pb id="sally32" n="32"/>
forgive her. But forgiveness was not in his 
heart. He called her careless and lazy, and, 
seizing her by the shoulder, whipped her 
severely. She went home miserable indeed. 
She had nothing to turn to for comfort, and 
her future—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“It rambled out in endless aisles of mist,</l><l>The farther still the darker.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Every night she had to sit up late, carding 
rolls for her mother to spin, or spinning 
herself under her direction. Her only recreation 
was an occasional dance on Saturday evening. 
So in dreary monotony her days went on.</p>

          <p>COULD Sally banish from her mind all
troublesome thoughts and reproaches of
conscience because her young master had bid
<pb id="sally34" n="34"/>
her do it? Ah no! Her heart was full of yearning and
dissatisfaction.</p>
          <p>When she was twelve years old she was a tall and
comely girl, and went regularly to labor in the field.
The only thing to which she looked forward with
pleasure, was the dance at the close of the week; and
her little earnings were parted with to procure now and
then a bit of finery for this occasion. Sometimes she
went to the Sunday prayer meeting, but was usually so
fatigued that she slept through most of the services. If
an alarming word felt upon her ear, and awakened
uneasy thoughts, she tried to forget it, and to persuade
herself that she had no cause for fear. But often, when
returning exhausted from the field through the dim
twilight, with the fading sunset glories before her, and
the songs of happy birds in her ear, she would
be so weary of the life she lived, and so full of vague
longing for comfort and peace, that she would throw
herself upon the ground in uncontrollable tears. Who
was to help her? An ignorant girl on a lonely
plantation, away from all exterior influences for good;
obliged to toil from morning till night; surrounded by
those as poor and simple as herself; with
<pb id="sally35" n="35"/>
the only educated and refined person who ever noticed
her, the only one to whom she looked up as to a 
superior being, telling her that there was “no hereafter;” 
that she had only to work by day and sleep by night, till 
at last she would drop into the ground and crumble 
to dust like the autumn leaves, Ah! there is One 
who never slumbers, and the poorest and most neglected 
child is as dear to Him as the loftiest king. He who feedeth 
the young ravens when they cry, and without 
whose notice not a sparrow falls to the ground, 
was even then preparing her for rest and joy 
through knowledge of Him.</p>
          <p>September came, and with it a series of
camp meetings. There was great joy on the
plantation when it was announced that one
was to be held in the immediate vicinity of
Fayetteville. It was years since such a thing 
had happened, and all the servants had the
promise of spending a day at least on the
camp-ground. As it was only two miles distant it was 
easy for them to go and come, according to 
the wish of the master. Sally was wild 
with delight. She should see something of 
the  great world, whose faint murmur
sometimes reached the plantation<corr sic="(no punctuation)">.</corr> There
<pb id="sally36" n="36"/>
would be the handsome carriages which occasionally
drove up to her mistress' door, and the fine ladies and
gentlemen with their servants, from all the country
round, and so many preachers, and such singing—it
was bewildering to think of!</p>
          <p>The important week came with cloudless skies. It
was arranged that the servants should attend the
meeting in turn, and Sally was not to go until the last
day, Friday, Her excitement was in no degree lessened by the 
glowing accounts of those who preceded her. She could hardly
wait for the time to arrive. Her calico dress was
smoothed, a new ribbon was tied over her bonnet, and
at five o'clock on Thursday afternoon she was ready to
start with the others, in order to spend the night on the
ground. How happy she was to have a week-time
holiday, and to walk so blithe and free across the
fields! Beneath this outward gladness, too, there was
an undefined hope that she might obtain something to
satisfy the craving of her nature. With
snatches of hymns and merry words to her companions, she
beguiled the way. An occasional tree obstructed the
view, but at length she began to hear the faint hum of
voices, and
<pb id="sally37" n="37"/>
soon a quick turn in the path revealed
the scene. A pleasant pine-grove had been
chosen for the camp, and the white tents
gleamed here and there through the dusky
boughs. The horses and carriages were
grouped upon the outskirts, and in the
center many hundreds of men, women, and
children were gathered round the preacher's
stand, in the red light of the setting sun. A
solemn hush was over the assembly, and as
Sally drew nearer, the wind bore to her ear
the words of the hymn with which the services 
were concluding:</p>
          <lg type="song">
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>“O! every weary, wounded soul, </l>
              <l>Come away; </l>
              <l>'Tis Jesus waits to make you whole, </l>
              <l>Come away.</l>
              <l>His precious blood was freely spilt</l>
              <l>To cleanse you from your dreadful guilt;</l>
              <l>He says, ‘I'll save thee if thou wilt, </l>
              <l>Come away.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>“The judgment day is stealing on,</l>
              <l>Come away; </l>
              <l>Your hours of hope will soon be gone, </l>
              <l>Come away.</l>
              <l>With Jesus do you wish to dwell, </l>
              <l>And all his wondrous mercy tell, </l>
              <l>Who saved your soul from burning hell? </l>
              <l>Come away.”</l>
            </lg>
          </lg>
          <pb id="sally38" n="38"/>
          <p>The music and the somber pines brought back that
other evening when she had soon her little playmate
buried, and the tears rolled down her cheeks as she
passed through the crowd and sought the tent
belonging to her master.</p>
          <p>The wind sighed all night through the trees, and
the stars shone overhead. Sally lay down to sleep upon
the straw floor, sorely puzzled to reconcile what she
heard about the mysterious future. In her dreams, she
thought her young master died, but came to her again
in the garden-path, looking wan and wretched, and told
her, in a voice like the wind in the pines, that he had
been mistaken; that there <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a hereafter, and that she
must take warning by his miserable fate, and prepare
to meet it. Then she thought she lay calmly on her own
death-bed, and all who stood around rejoiced with her
that her toilsome days were over, and that she was
sinking into the sleep from which no master's call
could rouse her, and from which she never could rise to
pain.</p>
          <p>The sun shone brightly into the tent, and she woke.
The morning was glorious out there in the forest. The
birds sang and the dew glistened, as they might have
done in
<pb id="sally39" n="39"/>
Eden when the world was young. The early meal was
soon despatched, and the tents put in order, for a, new
preacher was expected, and the closing exercises were
eagerly anticipated by all. Carriages began to arrive,
and by ten o'clock a vast congregation had assembled in
the grove. Just in front of the platform sat Sally, in a
seat which she had taken pains to secure an hour
before. The people were becoming impatient, when a
murmur was heard, and the expected preacher, who
had ridden hastily from another meeting,
passed through the crowd and gained the stand. He was
a tall, slender man, with an impetuous manner, and a
face which seemed to say:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Be earnest, earnest., earnest;</l><l>Do what thou dost as if the stake were heaven,</l><l>And that thy last deed ere the judgment day.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>He throw aside his traveling coat, and without delay
began to sing, in a rich, minor voice, these words:
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Hark! 'tis the trump of judgment</l><l>That God's archangel blows!</l><l>O, sinner! will you hasten</l><l>To Jesus with your woes?</l><pb id="sally40" n="40"/><l>For on this little moment,</l><l>Before the hour of doom,</l><l>Hang endless years of glory,</l><l>Or endless years of gloom.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Perhaps you do not hear it,</l><l>Perhaps your heart is cold,</l><l>And earth's enticing pleasures</l><l>Are all that you behold.</l><l>O, sinner! look and listen,</l><l>And loud for mercy cry;</l><l>For in His sweet compassion</l><l>The Savior passes by.”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <p>There was no heart that was not awed by the
solemn music, and every head was bowed, as the
preacher knelt to pray. Sally had never heard such a
prayer, It was the outpouring of a heart that said—
“I will not lot thee go except thou bless me,” me and all
this waiting congregation. It was talking with God as
friend talks with friend, till Sally believed in His
existence with her whole soul, and expected to see Him
appear in the parted sky, and answer with audible
voice the strong petition. When it was ended, the
preacher rose, and, opening the Bible, read the parable
of the tares of the field, selecting for his text the
closing verses:
<q type="quotation" direct="unspecified"><p>“The Son of man shall send forth His 
<pb id="sally41" n="41"/>
angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom
all things that offend, and them which do 
iniquity, and shall cast them into a furnace of
fire; there shall be wailing and gnashing of
teeth.”</p><p>“There shall the righteous shine forth as
the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Who
hath ears to hear, let him hear.”</p></q></p>
          <p>There was no logical introduction, no
display of doctrines, but the truth was sent
straight home to every hearer as if he, and 
the speaker, and God alone were present. In 
simple words, and with imagery drawn from
the scenes about them, the preacher portrayed 
their duty and their danger. “This 
morning,” said he, “as I was riding through
the forest, I saw a  bird trembling and
fluttering in the snare of a serpent.  It would
have been devoured had I not sprung
from my horse and killed the monster.  Ah!
thought I, this is just the way the devil snares
poor sinners. Those of you who are in high
stations he charms with riches, and honors,
and worldly ease; and to those who are poor,
and have little to hope for in life he whispers,
‘You have no need to trouble yourselves
about doing right; you must take what
<pb id="sally42" n="42"/>
comfort you can now, and rely upon happiness 
hereafter;’ or else, he tells you, ‘You may do 
as you please, for death will end your existence.’ 
No matter what he says, you are in 
his power, and he is luring you on to destruction, 
and unless you call to Christ to vanquish
him with speedy blows, he will swallow you up in
infinite ruin.”</p>
          <p>Sometimes he rose to a higher, wilder strain.
“Did you ever think what it would be to be cast out
for ever from God? If it were for a million of years,
you could endure that; but <hi rend="italics">for ever!</hi>—that is
unbearable. What is hell? Why, it is a great burning
desert, over which the lost wander without shelter, or
cooling draught, or momentary repose, unable to be
quiet because of the fires of rage and remorse that
torment them from within. In the center of this desert
there rises a mountain, and on it is a huge clock. Once
in a thousand years it strikes one, and as the mournful
sound vibrates through the burning air, the wretched
souls shriek out in echo, Eternity just begun! Eternity
just begun!”</p>
          <p>Having, with rapid gesture and passionate
utterance, pictured the condition of the sinner, he
began to speak in gentle tones of “the
<pb id="sally43" n="43"/>
Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the
world.” And he sang:</p>
          <lg type="song">
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>“Whose is that voice so kind and sweet, </l>
              <l>That seems my inmost heart to greet?—</l>
              <l>That whispers, ‘sinner, come to me, </l>
              <l>And thou shalt rest and glory see’—</l>
              <l>'Tis Jesus.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>“And can the Lord of glory mean</l>
              <l>That I upon his breast may lean?</l>
              <l>Will He, so great beyond compare,</l>
              <l>Help me my heavy load to bear?</l>
              <l>Will Jesus?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg type="stanza">
              <l>“He will; and when this life is o'er,</l>
              <l>And toil and burdens are no more,</l>
              <l>How gladly from the earth I'll rise</l>
              <l>To endless bliss in Paradise </l>
              <l>With Jesus.”</l>
            </lg>
          </lg>
          <p>Sally had listened with her whole soul to the
preacher, and now these tender words quite
overpowered her. Was she not a sinner? Had she not a
heavy load to bear? Did she not yearn for sympathy
and rest? She looked up with streaming eyes and saw
just before <sic corr="her">her her</sic> young master, who, out of idle
curiosity, had come to the camp ground. In spite of his
irreligion, he was momentarily affected by the scene.</p>
          <pb id="sally44" n="44"/>
          <p>“So you like this, Sally?”</p>
          <p>“O mas'r! 'pears like it's what I's been wantin' dis
long time.”</p>
          <p>“Well, well,” he answered, as he turned away, “get
it if you can.”</p>
          <p>There was a fervent prayer that none there
assembled might be among the lost in the Great Day,
and then with shouts, and sobs, and fervent
ejaculations, the meeting broke up.</p>
          <p>It was almost dark when the servants reached the
plantation. In distress and uncertainty Sally lay down
that night to sleep, and, for the first time in her life,
tried to pray. So guilty did she feel herself, that she
would not have dared to do it, if that gentle invitation
had not rung in her ears—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Sinner, come to me,</l><l>And thou shalt rest and glory see.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>In dreams she lived over the excitements of the day.
She was aroused in the morning by the call to labor,
and, bewildered, hurried to her plowing in the field. She
was not the only anxious one. Many of the servants
were awakened, and the usual merriment was hushed.
Silently she went her weary rounds. She wanted the
Savior, but she know not
<pb id="sally45" n="45"/>
how to find Him. Would He accept one so poor as she?
And if He would, was she willing to give up all her
known sins and follies for His sake? She thought she
was, but she was ignorant, and had no one to guide her.
She was distracted with her emotions. Her brain
seemed on fire. Noontime came, and she stopped her
team by the side of the field. The earth seemed to spin
around her, and losing her consciousness, she fell, as if
lifeless, to the ground. Her companions gathered about
her, and bore her to the nearest cabin, where she lay for
two days moveless and insensible. On the third day
this trance-like state passed away, and she revived and
was herself again. And in her dream she believed herself
in heaven, and she thought the Lord Jesus came to her
with the most loving words, and told her to be His
child, and follow his precepts, and He would be with
her in every trial, and bring her at last to His “rest and
glory.” Then she arose and went cheerfully about her
accustomed labor, feeling that she was no longer
friendless and alone.</p>
          <p>“So,” said Aunt Sally, “dat's de way I come through
in dis low ground o' sorrow.”</p>

          <p>Sally's real owner was a maiden lady who was deaf
and dumb. She had nearly a hundred slaves, but as she
could not bear the loneliness of the plantation, she hired them out
principally to her brother, and spent her time in
traveling from place to place. Sally's mother was
now taken to be her waiting-maid, and accompanied her
wherever she went. This was great grief to Sally,
for as long as her mother was there, there was always
a degree of neatness and comfort and enjoyment even, in
their poor cabin. What
<pb id="sally47" n="47"/>
household is there out of which the careful,
provident mother could be taken, and not
leave need and desolation behind her? The
mother! why the family happiness centers in
her; and this poor slave woman, in her
narrow sphere, was as important as any white
mother who graces an elegant house, and
counts her children as her jewels! Somewhat
stern she was, rarely talking much with her
children, but training them to the best of her
ability in all industry and honesty.  Every 
moment she could gain from labor, was spent 
in spinning, and knitting, and sewing to keep 
them decently clothed. Her husband worked 
on a plantation fourteen miles away. Once a 
month he came to see his family.</p>
          <p>“We was allers glad to see father come,” 
said Aunt Sally, “cause he brought us 'coons 
an' 'possums, an' we had meat to eat. I 
thought drefful hard o' mother for makin' 
me spin nights; but she didn't say nothin', 
—'peared like she kep' it all in her head. 
One day he says to me, ‘Sally,’ says she,
‘you dunno whar you'll eat your last pound 
o' bread;’ but I thought to be sure I know; 
I shall eat it down in the rice-field.”</p>
          <p>Now there was no motherly care, and the
<pb id="sally48" n="48"/>
children were scattered. Sally would have been quite
inconsolable, had it not been for her new-found trust
and hope in the Master above. She was very young;
she was very ignorant; she had nothing to help her to
understand the Gospel; but the Spirit was teaching her,
and in her poverty and loneliness she was learning
those great life lessons which, in one way or another,
all must apprehend who would enter the Kingdom.
When she was tempted to do wrong and to despair, she
thought of her heavenly vision, and the Savior again
stood near her, and she was comforted, and the
temptation flow away. She was fond of singing, and
readily catching the hymns which she heard, she
lightened thus many a toilsome hour. This, which she
learned from a visitor at “the house,” was a great
favorite in those days:
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Jesus once was poor and lonely,</l><l>And a manger was his bed;</l><l>He, the radiant King of Glory,</l><l>Had not where to lay his head.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“‘Come,’ He says, ‘all ye that labor,</l><l>And ye heavy laden, come;</l><l>I to every soul am Neighbor,</l><l>I will give you welcome home.’</l></lg><pb id="sally49" n="49"/><lg type="stanza"><l>‘ ‘Days to me were dark and dreary,</l><l>Lighted only from within;</l><l>Listen, every heart that's weary, </l><l>I will take away your sin.’</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“‘Fear not; on this bosom tender</l><l>The disciple found repose;</l><l>If thy love to Me thou'lt render,</l><l>I will banish all thy woes.’</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Lord! I'll worship and adore Thee,</l><l>Through my darkened earthly days;</l><l>And in heaven, at last, before Thee,</l><l>Sing in nobler notes Thy praise.”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <p>A change occurred in the family. The old master
died, and the slaves were transferred to the rule of
“young Mas'r Harry,” who has before been mentioned.
A wayward youth, he had grown into an intelligent
and active, but worldly and violent man. Soon after his
accession to power, he married a lively young
lady, from one of the aristocratic families in the
vicinity, and made her mistress of the plantation.
Sally now went constantly to her work in the field, 
but the lady's quick eye observed her, and 
she soon singled her out from the rest 
as the one upon whom to call when she needed
any extra service in the house. Sally liked the change,
and strove to please her.</p>
          <pb id="sally50" n="50"/>
          <p>Among the servants who worked on a distant part
of the plantation, was a young
man named Abram Williams. Sally was now thirteen
years old, and her mistress decided that she should be
married, and that this young man should be her
husband. Both were her property, therefore the only
part they had to play was to acquiesce in the
arrangement. It happened very well in this case, but the
same power could have been employed, had they
disliked each other. What think you of a system which
gives such unlimited control, not only over the time
and labor of men and women, but over their most
sacred affections? Sally had never seen him, and knew
nothing about the matter, till one day, when she was in
the house, her mistress said—</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally, you 're thirteen years old, and I want
you to be married. There's a young man over on the
plantation who'll make you a good husband. He'll
come here soon, and you'll see him,” and then
followed an enumeration of his good qualities.</p>
          <p>“Laws, Missis!” was the only reply Sally could
make. After that she missed no opportunity to
speak of him to the 
<pb id="sally51" n="51"/>
simple-hearted girl, till Sally said, “'Pears like I
loved him 'fore ever I saw him.” True to
her word, the mistress sent for him. They
were pleased with each other, as she had
predicted, and as there was no reason for
delaying their union, it was agreed that they
should be married as soon as the hurry of the
planting time was over. He was a kind,
good-hearted man, and Sally was happier
than she had been for a long time, in feeling
that she had some one to love who would love
her.</p>
          <p>One pleasant Saturday afternoon, a few weeks after
this, was fixed upon for the wedding. Work was closed
early, so that the servants might participate in the
festivities. Sally's scanty wardrobe had been growing
less in her careful mother's absence, and now she had
no decent dress for the occasion. Her mistress
produced from her own stores an old white muslin.
frock, and added to it a bright ribbon for her waist, and
a gauze handkerchief to tie around her head. Abram
was equally destitute, and his coarse field dress was
exchanged for the time for some cast off clothes of his
master's, which made him look, so Sally thought, quite
like a gentleman. As
<pb id="sally52" n="52"/>
a special mark of favor, the Ceremony was to
be performed in the house. The hour came,
and with their bridemaid and groomsman
they stood up before the colored Methodist
preacher who was in waiting. He opened
the Bible and read the account of the 
marriage at Cana. Sally had never heard it
before, and the thought that Jesus had been
present at an earthly wedding, impressed her,
more than anything had ever done, with the
importance of what she was about to do. No
one had ever taught her the sacredness of the
marriage tie. She had heard it jested about,
and had seen it lightly broken, and so it was
to her rather an incident of life than one of
its solemnities. But now an awe crept over
her; she felt as if God were there, and 
resolved, in heart, to do all in her power for her
new-found friend. The reading was followed
by a prayer, and then they were pronounced
husband and wife. There was a momentary
hush in the room. All seemed touched by
the services save the master, who had 
condescended to grace them with his presence, and
stood leaning in the door-way, with a satirical
smile upon his face. What were to him the
words, “whom God hath joined together let
<pb id="sally53" n="53"/>
no man put asunder?” Did he not know that if for any
reason he wished to raise a sum of money, he should
separate them, and sell them, with as little feeling as he
would a horse or a bushel of rice? No wonder he
smiled and thought it folly! The mistress rose, and
going up to the young couple, wished them much of
happiness and prosperity. She was followed by all the
servants in their turn, and when the congratulations
were over, she led the way to the open air, where a
table was set upon the lawn. It was ornamented with a
handsome cake, which she herself had made, and
adorned with flowers. Sally, as lady of the day, was
made to sit down and pour coffee for the company.
When the repast was ended, the lawn was quickly
cleared for a dance, in which the mistress insisted that
the newly married pair should take the lead. Sally had
never danced since the camp-meeting, but they all
insisted that she would not be properly married unless
she did so, and she was forced to comply. “Dat was de
last time I danced,” said she, in relating it; “'pears like 't
want right, noway.”</p>
          <p>It was a gay party, and as evening came on, Sally's
light-heartedness returned, and she
<pb id="sally54" n="54"/>
thought she had never been so happy in her
life. Ah! could she have looked into the
future, and seen what deepest griefs would
come to her through her a  affections, what
gloom would have o'ershadowed her marriage
eve! The light wind in the trees would have
changed to a mournful wail, and the stars
that now seemed to smile, would have gazed
down upon her with saddest eyes. And the
birds singing good-night songs in the 
sycamores above her—the happy birds who could
choose their mates and live lovingly all the
summer through without one fear of separation, 
how would their notes have pierced her
heart, could she but have looked forward! </p>
          <p>But no “coming event cast its shadow before,” and
in a merry mood the party broke up, and the servants
sought their cabins.</p>

          <p>THE Sabbath morning rose clear out of the starry
night, and with it came the necessity of Abram's return
to his plantation, in order to be ready for Monday's
work. Sally was distressed at this immediate
separation. He was much older than herself, and her
young heart was happy to have something to cling to,
and to call its own. She prepared him the best breakfast
in her power from the remnants of the wedding table,
and then, tying a handkerchief over her head, set out to
accompany him as far as she was able, on his
homeward way. Hand in hand they walked through the
dewy fields, trying to encourage each other with the
hope that there would come a time when they should
<pb id="sally57" n="57"/>
know no separation, The merry birds flow singing
above them, the early flowers gave out their odor, the
pines waved their branches in the breeze, clad in the
fresh green of spring. Sally tried to restrain her tears,
but when they reached the bounds of her master's
plantation, beyond which she could not go without
special permission, they burst forth anew.</p>
          <p>“I know I's wicked, Abram', but I jest wish Mas'r
Harry had to go 'way leave Missis like you leave me; I
do! De white folks ken do jest as dey please, why
can't we?”</p>
          <p>“Don't cry, Sally,” said kind-hearted
Abram, “I'll 'come'' back an' see you soon
as dey'll let me.”</p>
          <p>Sally had thrown herself down beneath the
shadow of a pine, and sat for some minutes
quietly. At length she exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“I's wonderin' if de Lord knows how bad I 
feels dis morning'. He had such heaps o' trouble, 
I specs He's sorry for us. Come an' kneel 
down, Abram, an' I'll pray to Him de bes' 
way I ken.”</p>
          <p>Together they knelt, and in simple, broken words
she poured out her heart to Him who never slights the
humblest cry. A strange peace filled her soul, and,
rising, she bade her
<pb id="sally58" n="58"/>
husband a calm farewell. He was awed by the prayer,
for to know much loss of religion than she, and
promising to see her on Monday night, if possible,
he turned away, and was soon lost to the gaze amid
the somber pines. </p>
          <p>It was high noon when Sally reached home. 
As she walked up the long avenue that led to the
house, the first object which attracted her attention
was the carriage of her old mistress before the door.
Then her mother had come—her mother, whom she had
not seen for months! She ran quickly to the house to
see if it were so, and was told by one of the servants
that “Ole Missis” had really returned. She had been
prevented from reaching home the night before by
finding one of the bridges gone on the road to 
Fayetteville, and had arrived about
an hour previous. To Sally's eager inquiries for her
mother, she answered, that, after helping her tired
mistress to bed, she had left the house. “I specs she's
lookin' arter you, Sally; she took on powerful when
she heard you'd done got married.”</p>
          <p>Sally hastened to her mother's old cabin, which now
was hers, and, sure enough, there she was sitting on
the low bed, She looked so neat in her trim waiting-maid's
dress, that
<pb id="sally59" n="59"/>
her daughter, who had approached unperceived, could
not help stopping to regard her with admiration. A
moment, and she was in her arms.</p>
          <p>“Oh, mother, I's so glad you've come.”</p>
          <p>“Chile, chile,” said the mother, while unwonted
wonted tears ran down her cheeks, “what have ye
done? De Lord knows I'd rather have soon ye in yer
grave than married. S'pose ye thought ye'd be better
off, but chile, yer mistaken. Mebbe Abram Williams is
a good man, an'll be kind to ye; but de kinder he is, an
de more ye loves him, de worse ye'll feel by an' by.
Don't I know? Didn't I love your father better than all
de world, an' wa'nt he allers kep' way on de big
plantation, till now dey say he's is sold to a speculator?
An' den, when I laid out to take some comfort in my
chil'n, an' worked so hard to take care of 'em, wan't dey
all scattered an' carried off, de Lord knows whar, an'
you only left in de ole cabin when I come home? Oh,
Sally, gettin' married's de beginnin' o' sorrow; my heart
aches to think what ye've got to bar! De white folks
ken get married an' live happy all der days, but 'pears
like dere's no peace for us no whar.”</p>
          <pb id="sally60" n="60"/>
          <p>“Don't talk so, mother. Abram says he'll ask Mas'r
to let him come an' live on de place, an' den we'll have
good times.”</p>
          <p>“No, chile, it's no use. I knows. Dat' allers de way.
Ole Missis goin' away to-morrow, an' I shall have to
leave ye to suffer as I've done.”</p>
          <p>Poor mother! poor daughter! Silent they sat with
their arms around each other, till the sycamore trees
threw their evening shadows across the door. They had
no plans to talk over, no hopes to impart; for what
plans can they form who have no independent will?
and what individual hopes can they cherish who exist
solely for the benefit of others?</p>
          <p>Sally's usual light-heartedness was not proof against
her mother's despair. There was nothing in the past to
which they cared to turn, and the anticipated future
weighed them down with pain. At length, the
gathering twilight warned the mother that her services
would be required by her mistress, and she rose to go.</p>
          <p>“Good night, chile; I must go now. Missis 'll want
me, an' I shan't see ye again. Ye'll be gone to de field
'fore I ken come down here in de mornin.' <hi rend="italics">Do de bes'
ye ken,</hi> an' tell
<pb id="sally61" n="61"/>
Abram, yer mother says ye mus' be kind to
each, other while ye live togeder—de
Lord knows how long dat'll be! Try to please 
young Mas'r an' Missis, so's to put off de evil 
day—but it'll come, chile, it'll come, an, ye
mus' be spectin' on't. 'Bove all, don't forget
yer prars, 'cause if de Lord aint yer friend, 
whar'll ye go?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, mother, I's allers a prayin'—'pears like it's
de greatest comfort I's got.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Chile, dat's right. May de dear Lord
bless ye! Far'well.”</p>
          <p>At daybreak the next morning, Sally was
on her way to the rice-field. Her marriage
had come and gone like any other incident in
life, and now she must resume her daily toil.
The hours went by slowly as she dropped the
rice into the drills, and covered it lightly with
her hoe. She had little disposition to talk
with her companions, and had she desired it,
it would not have been permitted. There was
a new overseer on the plantation; a harsh,  
unfeeling man, who restricted the servants
in every possible way. When the hot noon
came on, they stopped to take their scanty
dinner—a small piece of broad and meat, and
some boiled rice. At a little distance was a
<pb id="sally62" n="62"/>
spring of clear cold water, to which they had been
accustomed to go to quench their thirst. 
But now even this was refused, because it 
occupied too much time, and their only drink 
was the water which ran along between the 
ridges of the rice-field. The mid-day meal
over, in silence they returned to their monotonous
tasks. Had they been free men and 
women working for themselves and their 
children, with the stimulating hope of better 
fortune, which their labor should achieve, 
they would not have been monotonous; but
when they could see nothing in the future 
but the same thankless toil, with the liability 
of losing, at any moment, the few domestic 
joys they possessed, it was weary work to 
scatter the grain and handle the hoe.</p>
          <p>In the twilight, fatigued and hopeless, they 
sought their cabins. Abram did not come, as
Sally had expected, and a week went by 
before she saw him again. “Now,” said she, 
“I begun to see de hardes' times I ever see 
any whar in my life.” With hard work,
scanty food, a cruel overseer, an indifferent 
master, and a gay mistress, growing every 
day more careless and forgetful of her 
dependents, what chance had she for comfort?</p>
          <pb id="sally63" n="63"/>
          <p>A year of hardship passed away, and 
Sally's son Isaac was born. She loved him 
with a mother's tenderness, but not with a 
mother's joy; for, young as she was, she had 
soon so in much of trial and privation that she 
could not regard life to one in her condition 
as a blessing. When she was able to return 
to her work, she could not bear to leave her 
baby behind her to be neglected, so she tied 
him into her dress, and carried him with her 
to the field. He was a sturdy little fellow,
and grow apace, in spite of all his disadvantages. 
Once a month his father came to see 
him, giving what help and encouragement he 
could to the mother, and bringing her his 
little earnings, to assist her in providing for
their child. Sorrowful meetings and partings 
they were, and yet pleasant, because all they 
knew of affection and sympathy was in them.</p>
          <p>Two years more, during which nothing occurred to
vary the dreary round of their existence, and another
son was born, whom they called Daniel. It was the
season of the year when all the fieldhands were
engaged in plowing, and when he was three weeks old,
Sally took her place with the rest. Now she
<pb id="sally64" n="64"/>
had two children whom she would not leave behind, so
one was placed securely in her bosom, and the other
fastened to the skirt of her dress, which was rolled up
in front to make a resting place for him. Thus burdened,
she worked on, never losing her rounds, for a mother
is a mother every where, in the rice fields of Carolina,
or amid northern snows. It was not unusual for the
women to take their children to the field, but they were
accustomed to lay them down upon the grass by the
fences. Sally would not do this, for upon a neighboring
plantation a child so left had been strangled by a snake,
and was found quite dead when the work was over.
How many prayers did Sally send up to heaven in
these dismal days! Were they not registered there?</p>
          <p>The master grew daily more reckless and extravagant
for himself, and more indifferent to the comfort of his
slaves. “He fed us mos'ly on skim milk an' Irish
potaters,” said Aunt Sally, “an' peared like sometimes
we should starve.” On one of the adjoining
plantations there was a kind and liberal
master who gave his servants plenty of 
provisions. There is a strong community of
<pb id="brown65" n="65"/>
feeling among the slaves, and they are always ready to
assist those who are less fortunate than themselves.
Sally knew that she should not appeal in vain to her
neighbors, so many a night after all the household were
in bed, she would take the horse which she used in
plowing, and ride stealthily over to their hospitable
cabins, sure always to got some dried meat, or a bag of
meal, from the generous occupants. Then hastening
back, in silence and watchfulness, she would cook a
little for herself and her children, In ways like this she
eked out their scanty fare, always anxious, and fearful
of being discovered.</p>
          <p>During this miserable time another child was born to
her, but its little life was soon closed; and at evening,
after working hours were over, it was buried in a rough
box out among the pines. Sally did not mourn for it;
she was glad it had escaped the misery of their earthly
lot. No stone marked its grave, but the mother knew
the spot, and sometimes stole out there at night to
pray. She was always comforted, for God seemed near
to her there, and she fancied the wind in the trees above
her was singing her child's lullaby, and hushing it to
sweet repose.</p>

          <p>The master grew every day more reckless
in his expenditures, and more unreasonable
in his demands upon his servants. Among
the household duties which Sally occasionally
performed, was that of seeing that the milk
was properly strained and taken care of.
One morning her mistress was out of humor,
and imagining taken that Sally had not taken 
pains with her work, she complained to her husband.</p>
          <pb id="sally67" n="67"/>
          <p>“Look here, Sally,” said he, “do you put the milk in
a pan that is n't washed?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, no, mas'r, I takes partikler pains to have it
clean.”</p>
          <p>“Do you mean to contradict your mistress?” </p>
          <p>“I didn't, mas'r.”</p>
          <p>“You didn't, did you? I'll see!”</p>
          <p>Seizing her by the arm, he whipped her severely, and
at length desisting from very weariness, he called out, 
“Now see if you'll tell the truth the next time.”</p>
          <p>Half crazed with pain and terror, she crept away to
the field. She dared not neglect her tasks, and all
through that wretched day she followed the plow,
smarting from the blows. It was the crisis of her fate.
Year after year she had suffered on, and now she felt
that she could endure no longer. With her buoyant
nature, she would not have despaired could she have
seen one distant gleam of hope, but matters were daily
getting worse on the plantation, and she know not
where to turn for light.</p>
          <p>Revolving those things in her mind as she went her
weary rounds, she came to the desperate resolution of
running away, and with
<pb id="sally68" n="68"/>
uplifted heart, she asked God to pardon her if she was
wrong, and to help her if she was right.
Communicating to no one her intention, he
sought her cabin at the usual hour,
and procuring her children's supper, eating
none herself, so oppressed was she by her
pain,
 and by the thought of what she was about to do.
She dared not leave the grounds till all was quiet, and
while the children slept upon the floor, she busied
herself in collecting their little clothing, and 
tying it up in a bundle, which she could 
conveniently carry. The early moon was shining 
in the sky, and she must wait till it went 
down. As she sat there in silence, she 
wondered if she were about to commit a sin, 
for she had been trained to such implicit obedience to her
master, that she hardly dared think of resisting his will. 
Suddenly she heard the sound
of horses' hoofs, and of voices, coming up the
walk. She remembered that her master had
ridden over to Fayetteville in the morning,
and it was his voice, and that of the overseer,
to which she listened.</p>
          <p>“Here's that girl, Sally, Mr. Green, you must look
after her a little. She's never been
<pb id="sally69" n="69"/>
fairly broken in yet. I made a beginning, this
morning. You must train her.”</p>
          <p>“Ah! leave me alone for that, sir. I'll fetch her
up to the mark. I'll give her a bigger task 
to-morrow, and if she don't do it, she'll see what
she'll get.”</p>
          <p>“The fact is, Mr. Green, I don't care how much
you got out of 'em. Things are going to ruin, and
I must make more money in some way.”</p>
          <p>The voices died away, and with them Sally's
irresolution. She would go at all risks.
The moon went down, and all was still.
Taking the sleeping Daniel in her arms, she
gently shook the older boy, saying, “Isaac,
Isaac, wake up chile. Don't you want to go
an' see yer father?” He opened his eyes
at the words, and accustomed to obey his
mother in all things, took her hand as she
passed out—out into the night so pure and
calm, with the holy stars above her, and the
dewy earth beneath her feet. Abram was
then at work on a plantation a few miles
away, and thither she directed her steps.
Avoiding the roads lest she should be 
discovered by some belated traveler, she 
hurried on  through the fields, keeping, where
<pb id="sally70" n="70"/>
it was possible, under the deep shadow of trees and
fences. Now and then the cattle stirring in the pastures,
or the neigh of a horse startled by her footsteps, would
make her heart beat quick, and she would stop to listen,
but no harm came to her, and carrying one, and sometimes
both, of the children, and hushing their questioning cries,
she at length reached her destination. Going softly up to
the door of Abram's cabin, she entered and roused him
from his heavy slumber. He was terrified to see her there
with her children, but soon understood wherefore she
had come.</p>
          <p>“There's no time to lose, Abram. I heerd that Aunt
Marthy was a-takin' in washin' in Fayetteville, an' I
know she'll let me an' de chil'n stay with her.”</p>
          <p>Breaking in two a piece of hoe-cake which she had
saved from her supper, she gave it to the boys, and
rising from the low bed where she had seated herself for
a moment, she took Daniel again in her arms, saying to
her husband, “You mus' tote Isaac, Abram, he's done
tired out, poor chile.”</p>
          <p>It was past midnight. Fayetteville was four miles
distant, and Abram must return
<pb id="sally71" n="71"/>
for his morning's work, so they hurried on.
He knew the road, and as it passed through
a quiet neighborhood, he was not afraid to
keep it. They talked little, for fear of being
on some way overheard, but arranged that
Sally and the boys should keep hid for a
while with “Aunt Marthy,” and that Abram
should see them as often as possible. Sally
knew not what was before her, but in spite
of the haste and the danger, it was delightful
to be walking so far from the plantation and
away from the overseer's eye. Stiff and sore
from the whipping she had received, her
heart was yet lighter than it had been for
many a day. The dawn had not yet begun
to glimmer in the east when they reached the
town and sought the narrow street and humble cottage
of “Aunt Marthy.” A good old creature she was;
owned by a man in Fayetteville, but hiring her time
and supporting herself and her children by washing.
She received Sally with open arms, without
manifesting much surprise at her appearance. She had
had the experience of many years, and she knew too
well the chances and changes in the life of a slave to be
astonished by them. “Laws, chile, I's been through it
<pb id="sally72" n="72"/>
all, an' I knows ye can't bear it unless ye loves do
Lord.”</p>
          <p>While it was yet dark Abram bid them
good-bye and hastened away. It was now
October, and from this time until New Year's
she lived quietly with Marthy, assisting her
daily toil. The boys were so young that
they would hardly be recognized, so they
played about the street with the other 
children, but Sally never went out except at
night; and then cautiously, and for short 
distances. During this time Abram was sold on
to a plantation near Fayetteville, and he often
stole in at evening to see his wife. He took
pains to hear about her master, and learned
from one of the servants that he was fearfully
angry when he found Sally had gone, and
threatened to kill her if he ever saw her
again; also, that his slaves were not to work
at home any more, but were all to be hired
out at New Year's. Sally knew she could
not long remain undetected where she was,
and believing that her master would not touch
her on account of his own interest, she 
resolved to go boldly when the day came and
hire herself out with the rest.</p>
          <p>The important morning arrived, and Sally
<pb id="sally73" n="73"/>
took her children and went out to a field on the old
plantation where she had heard the business of the day
would be transacted. What fervent prayers did her heart
send up as she walked along! She believed they were
heard, and her stop was firmer and her courage stronger
as she reached the ground. Her old companions were
already assembled there, and a crowd of the neighboring
planters were standing about, talking of the price and
capacity of those they wished to secure. Among them
was her master. He saw her, and muttering something
between his teeth, appeared as if he would confront her
as she advanced, but the gentleman with whom he was
speaking, said something in a dissuasive voice, and he
turned away. Sally's heart was full of thanksgiving as
she took her place with the rest. She believed the Lord
was with her as he was with Daniel in the lion's den.
The sales went on, and her turn at last arriving, she was
hired by a citizen of Fayetteville, an easy,
compassionate man, who had heard of the unjust
treatment she had received. A new hope dawned upon
her. Perhaps he would let her hire her time as her aunt
did. She ventured to propose it to him, and he
<pb id="sally74" n="74"/>
agreed that for six dollars a mouth, regularly paid to
him, she should be her own mistress, and do what she
pleased. The moment that she was free to act for
herself, with what spirit and energy did she take hold
of life. She had always had a natural fondness and
aptitude for cooking, and now she resolved to rent a
small house, and commence the sale of cakes and beer
of her own baking and brewing. Before a week had
passed she had rented a little tenement of two rooms,
and having procured a barrel of flour and other
necessaries in advance, she was ready to sell to any one
who would patronize her humble store. Her children
were both with her at first. When she had time, she
took in washing, and then she accustomed them to help
her to beat the clothes. In a month she had not only
paid for the flour, but she had also given to her new
master the first installment of hire-money. Very
judiciously she made her small purchases. She would
watch the market-wagons as they came in from the
country, and often buy her provisions to great
advantage. Every morning she carried a gallon of hot
coffee to the market for sale. The gentlemen soon
learned to know her, and would
<pb id="sally75" n="75"/>
buy a cup, sometimes throwing her fifty cents in return.
She had never dreamed of having so much money as she
now earned. She bought comfortable clothes for herself
and her children, and obtained, from time to time, little
articles of furniture for her house. And when, at the
end of the year the same arrangement was made with
her master for a much longer time, her heart
overflowed with gratitude to God, and she resolved
more and more to dedicate herself to Him. What was it
that made her so happy? The privilege of working
every moment for the support of herself and her
children, and of paying out of her earnings six dollars
every month to her master? Verily happiness is not
absolute, but relative, in this world.</p>
          <p>Abram still worked in the vicinity, and
often came to see her and the children. He
was a kind and affectionate man, but he had
not Sally's strength of character and firmness
of principle, and he was easily led astray.
He had lately fallen into a habit of gambling,
at which she was exceedingly distressed and
alarmed. She knew from young  “Mas'r Harry,”
the ruin to which it led, and while she
begged him to abandon it, she loved him so
<pb id="sally76" n="76"/>
well that she would sometimes give him money when
he came and told her of his losses. At length his master
discovered his visits to the gambling-room. He was not
grieved at his sin, but angry at his disobedience; and,
going to Sally, in a dreadful rage, he told her that, if her
husband ever gambled again, he would put him into jail,
and he never should come out from there as his 
servant. This frightened Abram, and for a year he kept
away. But one night the old temptation returned again,
and he went. His master heard of it, and threw him into
jail the following day, as he had threatened.
Sending for Sally, he told her what he had done, and
that he should sell him to Now Orleans.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Mas'r de Lord bless ye, won't ye try him
once more? He was allers such a good man, an' so kind
to me an' the chil'n!”</p>
          <p>“Now, Sally, you may just stop your crying around
here, for as sure as there's a God in heaven, he never
shall come out mine.”</p>
          <p>There was no hope, then. He must be sold, and
selling to New Orleans was to her like death. How
many whom she had known had gone the same way
and never been heard of
<pb id="sally77" n="77"/>
more! She would rather have soon him in his coffin.</p>
          <p>It was late when she reached home, too
late to go to the jail, and the night must wear
away in prayers and tears. She was up with
the dawn, and baking some fresh biscuit, and
making a pot of her nicest coffee, she took
them to the jail, and sat down upon the stone
steps until the doors should be opened. Her
mother's words came to her mind, and she
wept bitterly.  Her “evil day” had indeed
come. The passers by looked coldly upon
her. It was a common thing to see poor
slave-women sitting, in tears, upon the steps
of the jail. At length she was admitted.
Abram was quite overcome, when he saw
her, with remorse for his fault and grief at
their separation. For they had loved each
other, even as people do whose faces are fair!
Sally strove with her stronger heart to sustain him and to 
lift his thoughts to God. But
sorrow would have its way, and from nine
o'clock till one, they sat weeping and holding
each other's hands, as if it were indeed the
death hour. At length the rude voice of the
jailer was heard ordering her away. They
<pb id="sally78" n="78"/>
clasped each other convulsively for a moment, but the
husband could not speak. Amid her sobs, Sally exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Oh, Abram, far'well! Remember de Lord!
Remember de Lord! I shall pray for ye, ye
poor soul! Far'well, far'well!” </p>

          <p>“Oh,” said Aunt Sally, “dat was de dreffulest hour
I ever see in my life, when I turned my back on de jail.
'Peared like dere want nothin lef' in de world, an' when
I tried to pray, dere want no God to hear me. I didn't
mind my work dat day, but at jest lay on de bed, cryin'
an' groanin' as if my heart would break, an' wishin' we
was all dead in' out o' trouble. De chil'n, poor things,
tried to comfort me, but I thought, to be sure, dere's 
no comfort for me when dey sold my husband!</p>
          <p>“By-an'-by, when it was dark, Aunt Marthy cum to

was sold, an' she know'd well enough how
bad I'd feel. Wal, she sot down on de bed,
an' ses she, ‘Sally, I's cum to pray wid ye,
'cause I know it's de only thing dat'll do
ye any good.’ I thought to myself, dere's no
use a prayin.' Didn't I beg de Lord to let
my husband stay, an' want he sold all de
same as if I had hadn't asked him? But I didn't
speak, an' so she knelt down an' begun. At
first I didn't pay no 'tention to what she said,
<pb id="sally80" n="80"/>
but she kep' on, an 'peared as like Lord
Jesus was right in de room, an' she was
talkin' to Him. She told Him how 'flicted I

o' grievin', I wanted to praise de Lord for His

          <p>The next morning Sally resumed her usual duties,
and was to be seen in market and at home attending to
her customers. The <sic corr="ecstasy">ecstacy</sic> of the evening was gone, 
but something of “the peace of God, which passeth all 
understanding,” remained. She could not think 
of her husband without tears, and for
six months her health suffered from the shock she had
received, yet Jesus seemed nearer to her than ever
before, and she was consoled by the thought that He
was a friend on whom she could rely, at morning and
noon and evening. That sale was truly like death, for
she never saw or heard from Abram again. When Isaac
was twelve years old, he would have been taken from
her and put to service, but he was such a comfort to
her, and daily grew so helpful, that she could not bear
to part with him, so for two dollars a month she hired
him for two years of his master. Her kind Fayetteville
master was pleased with him, because he was so bright
and active, and offered to teach him to read if his
mother would purchase the necessary books. This she
gladly did, and as he learned rapidly, (albeit there was
no white blood in his veins,) she soon had the delight
of hearing the Bible
<pb id="sally82" n="82"/>
read by her son. It was the highest pleasure she
had ever known, to sit down with him in her neat
little room, when the work of the day was over,
and hear some chapter from the life of Christ, or
some thrilling Old Testament story. One night, when he had been
reading to her, slowly and carefully, for half an
hour, she suddenly exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Laws, Isaac, I never 'spected to see de like o'
dis—to hear you readin de Bible like de white
folks. 'Pears like de Lord's been so good to ye, I
hopes ye'll do all ye ken to, serve Him.”</p>
          <p>“I's been thinkin' o' dat dis long time, mother; I
b'lieve do Lord's got something for me to do.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, chile, we's all got something to do, an' we
must be willin' to do whatever de Lord gives us.
I's laid awake many a night, thinkin o' dis yer
thing, an' prayin' de Lord to help me. When yer
father was sold, I thought der want nothin' more
for me, but de Lord He brought me through, an' I's
made up my mind, 'taint no use calculatin' what
He'll do. We mus' try to do right whar he puts us,
an' den, if we's prepared for a better place, he'll
show it to us. I
<pb id="sally83" n="83"/>
specs ye 'll be a poor slave all yer days, Isaac, but if de
blessed Jesus is yer master, an ye bar de cross for his
sake, He'll make ye free at last in de Kingdom!” </p>
          <p>The tears stood in the boy's eyes as he listened to
his mother's words, and he resolved in his heart to do
the best he could in life, and to trust the Lord for all.</p>
          <p>When Abram had been gone four years, Sally's
master began to look for another husband to fill his
place. Sally had seen marriages so lightly made and
broken, that it was to her a matter of course. Her
respectability and thrift had procured her many
admirers, and as her master deigned to consult her on
the subject, she chose from among them a free colored
man named Beggs, because she thought he could never
be sold away from her. He bore a very good character,
excepting that be was somewhat addicted to
intemperance, but he rarely became intoxicated, or
treated her with anything but kindness. He worked at
his trade in town, and Sally continued her sale of cakes
and beer. She did not love him as she had done her first
husband, yet they lived quietly together, and, on the
whole, happily. Isaac and Daniel
<pb id="sally84" n="84"/>
were now away with separate masters, and Sally
would have missed them exceedingly had not their
places been partly supplied by the birth of a little boy,
whom she called Lewis. Other children she had who
died in their infancy, so that this little fellow, who was
sprightly and affectionate, was doubly dear to her. She
was now living in comparative ease and independence.
Little by little she had added necessary articles of
furniture to her house, and of dress to her wardrobe.
Her two rooms, with the porch adjoining, were always
neat and in order. Her baking and washing were
dispatched in the morning, and then, with clean apron,
and nicely folded handkerchief about her head, she was
ready to attend to her customers, or to do any little job
of sewing which she had taken in, for to her knowledge
of cooking and housework she added no small skill as
a dressmaker. She was able now to hire a girl to help her
in the house, and when it became known how good a
seamstress she was, she had much work brought her
by the ladies in the vicinity. In her prosperity Sally did
not forget the Lord. Most fervently did she thank Him
every day for His mercy. Naturally hopeful and buoyant,
<pb id="sally85" n="85"/>
she enjoyed the happy present, without daring or
wishing to anticipate the future. She went regularly to
church on the Sabbath, persuading her husband, when
he could, to accompany her; and when Isaac and Daniel
were permitted to visit her and to go with her also to
the meeting, her heart overflowed with thankfulness to
God. Sometimes they were allowed to go home with
her to spend the Sabbath evening. This was indeed
delightful. They must all go into the best room, which
was her pride, with its high feather bed, covered with a
bright patchwork quilt, its rocking-chair, its
little table, by the window, with the glass hanging
above it, and its chest of drawers, which contained all
the best articles of the family attire. Then she would
bring out a plate of her choicest cakes, and treat them
each to a cup of coffee, or a mug of her own innocent
beer. These joyful evening were always concluded by
Isaac's reading a chapter in the Bible, and his mother's
offering, up a grateful prayer.</p>
          <p>It would be pleasant to pause over this happy time
in Sally's life; this little gleam of sunshine in her
stormy sky, but events hurried on, and our narrative
must follow.
<pb id="sally86" n="86"/>
Sally's old mistress on the plantation had been
gradually declining in health for years, and now news
came that she was dead. Her slaves were divided
between her brothers and their children, and Sally and
her sons fell to one of the nephews, a dissipated young
man, who had wasted all his property, and had been
waiting impatiently for his old aunt's death, that he
might receive his portion of her estate. He wanted to
convert some of his share into ready money, so Isaac
and Daniel and Lewis were taken and sold in
Fayetteville at a public auction. Daniel was bought by a
planter far up the country; Isaac, by a gentleman who
lived a little way out of the town ; and Lewis, poor
little Lewis, his mother's darling, with his merry face
and sportive ways,—a speculator from Alabama, saw
him, and purchased him to go with a “lot” he had in 
waiting, to that seemingly distant and unknown land.
Sally's grief was great at parting from Daniel, whom she
might never see again, for, although not so intelligent as
her older son, he had always been and obedient to her.
She took leave of Isaac with more hope, for he was not
to be so far removed, but when it came to
<pb id="sally87" n="87"/>
Lewis, who was immediately placed in his purchaser's
traveling wagon, she was broken down with anguish.
The curse of servitude was upon her, although she had
married a free man. She was still a slave, and her
children were slaves, and only death could free them.
Her distress was increased by the rage and despair of
her husband, for he was as fond a father as she was a
mother. She saw the money paid down for her boy; she
heard him calling good-by to her out of the cart, and,
half frantic, she ran to him, and catching him in her
arms, held him tightly, as if they could never be parted.
He was only three years old, just learning to talk, and
every hour developing some new charm in his mother's
eyes. He did not understand her grief, and she would
not sadden his little heart by telling him he would never
see her more. Pleased at the prospect of a ride in a
wagon, he laughed and danced about, unconscious of
fear or sorrow. Sally gave him a little ginger-cake,
saying, as she put it into his hand, “Now, Lewis, break
it two , an' give mammy a piece.”</p>
          <p>“No,” said he, “didn't ye jes' gin it to me?”  The
poor mother burst into tears, and
<pb id="sally88" n="88"/>
the child, thinking it was all because she wanted the
cake, exclaimed, “Here, mammy, I <hi rend="italics">will</hi> gin ye a piece,”
and then her husband came and took her away. With
streaming eyes she watched the wagon till it
disappeared, and then, as she turned homeward, if she
had been familiar with the Scriptures, she would have
cried out in anguish, “All Thy waves and Thy billows
are gone over me.”</p>

          <p>IT was almost dark when Sally reached her own door.
Her husband had left her on the way, and gone into a low
drinking saloon, to drown his grief and anger in
intoxication. Some of her neighbors and acquaintances
were waiting for her return, and, going into the house with
her, tried to cheer her heart. But what can comfort a
mother when she is bereft of her children? If your three
only boys should be stolen from you in one day, without
hope of recovery, could any earthly friend console you?
Sally's sons were as much to her as yours are to you,
and the words of her visitors fell unheeded upon her ear. At
length, seeing that their efforts were of no avail, they
went out silently, and she was left alone. Alone! Yes,
it was such loneliness as only they can understand,
who have had a similar trial. For a while, she sat
immovable, and, as if stupefied by her grief, and then
she arose, and opening her little bureau, began to look
over the clothes that had belonged to Lewis; every
article of which she had labored hard to procure, and had
fitted and made for him with a mother's pride and
pleasure. The little frocks and aprons were taken up
and laid aside again,
<pb id="sally90" n="90"/>
but when She came to the tiny cap, with the jaunty
tassel upon one side, in which he had looked so smart
the Sunday before, and saw lying beneath it Isaac's
precious Bible, which was always in her keeping, and a
new shirt, partly finished, which she had intended as a
present to Daniel, she burst into tears, and, shutting
the drawer, throw herself in agony upon the bed. She
tried to pray, but she could only exclaim, amid her
sobs, “Oh, Lord, remember Lewis! Dear Lord, take
care o' my poor chil'n!”</p>
          <p>At length she fell asleep. And in her
dreams she thought she followed the wagon
which contained her child, on and on, over
plains and through forests, he all the while
laughing and clapping his hands, till at length
night overtook them, and the driver called
out to her that she must return. And as,
with a last despairing look, she began to
retrace her steps, she thought her little Lewis
became suddenly conscious that she was leaving him, 
and screamed out, “Oh, mammy,
take me, take me!” She would have rushed
to him and borne him off in her arms, but
his purchaser caught him fiercely back, and
putting his hand over his mouth to stop his
<pb id="sally91" n="91"/>
cries, drove on faster through the black concealing
pines. She awoke in terror, which was succeeded by
joy, at finding it was only a dream. Lewis had always
slept in a little trundle bed at her side, and, for the
moment, forgetting what had happened, and wishing to
re-assure herself, she called out, in the manner she was
wont to awaken him, “Lewis! Lewis!” But the room
was dark and still; and then the truth, more terrible
than any dream, flashed upon her mind, and she sank
down in hopeless grief upon the bed.</p>
          <p>But the morning stays not for any sorrow, and with
its coming Sally roused herself to attend to her work,
for the girl whom she had hired to help her was away
for a few days, and this was one of her busiest
seasons. She went about her tasks mechanically, for, to
her mother's heart, the incitement to labor was at an
end when there was no one to be benefited but herself.
Weeks went by, during which she went her daily
rounds in a kind of stupor, and of which afterward she
could remember nothing. Her flesh wasted away, and
her step, which was once so elastic, grow slow and
heavy. She would often go to the drawer and take out
Isaac's Bible, and weep
<pb id="sally92" n="92"/>
over it, and wish she could read its comforting words,
but it was a sealed book to her, and carefully she would
return it to its place. She knew many verses by heart,
and these she would often repeat to herself. Among
those was, “Come unto me all ye that labor and are
heavy laden, and I will give rest,” Yes, she would say, 
“Dat's what I wants, Lord—rest; I's allers been 
seekin' for it, but, Lord, I can't find
it.” Yet in one way she did find rest. She had received
into her inmost heart by a living faith, the story of
Christ's sufferings and death, and she felt that, in some
way, every trial she had, if borne for His sake, brought
her nearer to Him and heaven. Losing his son had made
her husband reckless and neglectful of his business, and
more and more given to intemperate
habits. This would have seemed to her a great affliction,
had she not had a greater one constantly to bear.
Another trial she had, too, in the jealousy of her
neighbors, both blacks and whites. It was rare for a
slave woman to be so well situated to show what she
could do for herself as Sally was. The constant increase
of her customers, and her popularity with them, her
tidy house, her
<pb id="sally93" n="93"/>
neat dress, and her self-relying, independent
manner, called forth many envious and malicious
remarks. Often, at the market, she
would hear such things as this from the white
people around her; “Wonder if Sally's master's always 
going to let her live in this way.
She's getting altogether too smart for a
nigger. We shan't know who's to rule by-and-by.” 
These unkind words went to her
heart, but she took no outward notice of them,
thinking it wisest to keep on her quiet way.
Sometimes the bitter thought would come into
her mind, “Why should I lose husband and
children, and be blamed and disliked for my
honest efforts to earn a comfortable living?”
And then she would still such repinings, and 
say, “It's de cross de Lord lays upon me, 
an' I'll bar it for His sake.”</p>
          <p>One, morning some four months after Lewis was
taken from her, as she was busy in the market, some
one called out to her—</p>
          <p>“Eh, Sally, is that you!”</p>
          <p> She turned quickly round, and saw, in the 
rough-looking man before her, the purchaser 
of Lewis.</p>
          <p>“That boy, Lewis, that I took out in the 
last lot belonged to you, didn't he?”</p>
          <pb id="sally94" n="94"/>
          <p>Eagerly she answered—“Yes, mas'r, he's de
youngest of my chil'en. Mebbe ye'll tell me whar
he is?”</p>
          <p>“Wal, he's down in Claiborne, on the Alabama 
river. There was a gentleman there took a
mighty fancy to him, and paid a big price for him,
that he did. He's a smart little chap. Shouldn't a
minded keeping him myself.”</p>
          <p>“He loved his mammy so, mas'r! Didn't he take
on when it come night?”</p>
          <p>“In course be did. Such young uns allers do,
It's nat'ral, you know. He screamed and cried for
two or three nights, and I said nothing, 'cause you
see, I thought he'd get over it himself. But he
didn't, and at last I got tired of it, you know, and I
just took him and give him a sound whipping, and
he was still as a mouse all the rest of the way.
That's the way to manage children.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord!” was all Sally could say.</p>
          <p>“Wal, as I was going on to tell you, I come
through Claiborne on my way back here after
another lot; prime ones, too, some on 'em is; first
rate bargains; and as I passed by the gentleman's
house, there I saw Lewis, with half a dozen other
young uns, playing about
<pb id="sally95" n="95"/>
the yard. I stopped my horse, and called out to him, 
‘Lewis! Lewis!’ Then he ran down the walk, and, says
I, ‘I'm going  back to Fayetteville, where your
mammy lives; what shall I tell her?’ He know'd me well
enough, and he thought a minute, and then, says he, 
‘Tell her to send me some cakes;’ and I promised him I
would. Ef I was in your place, too, I'd send him some
clothes. He looked kind o' ragged.”</p>
          <p>“When are ye gwine back, mas'r?”</p>
          <p>“Wal, I reckon about the first o' the week. One of
my gals has ran away, and I don't mean to start 'till I
get her. Strange they can't take it peaceable like, and
not give folks so much trouble. So you jest fix up your
bundle, and leave it down to Miller's store, and, if 't
aint too large, I'll take it.”</p>
          <p>“Thank'ee mas'r, thank'ee,” said Sally, “p'raps ye'll
have a drink o' coffee,” and she handed him a smoking
bowl full, which he swallowed with great satisfaction.</p>
          <p>“La, now,” said he, “that's the real article. I'm sorry
you lost your boy, but then we must expect such
things in this world of trial,” and with this comforting
reflection which the steaming coffee had inspired, he
wiped his
<pb id="sally96" n="96"/>
mouth with his yellow silk handkerchief, and passed
on.</p>
          <p>It was now Saturday morning, and when her duties
were over, Sally hastened home, and, making a small
bag of strong calico, she filled it with Lewis' favorite
hard ginger-cakes and crackers. Then, going to the
drawer which contained his clothes, she took out article
after article, and folding them, laid them together, till
she came to the pretty cap, over which she hesitated,
saying, “I specs he'll never go to meetin'; dere's no
use sendin' it; but in a moment she exclaimed, “Yes, I
will. Dey shall see how well off he was when his
mammy had him.” So they were all tied up together in
a neat parcel, and taken to the appointed place, Sally
only reserving for herself, as a memento, the little torn
apron he had worn the morning before he went away.
When she entered the store, the speculator himself
chanced to be there, and, giving him the bundle, she
said, “Will you please to tell Lewis his mammy says he
mus' be a good boy, an' not grieve for her?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, you needn't trouble yourself to send that
message. “S'pose he's forgot by this time that he ever
had a mother.” A low
<pb id="sally97" n="97"/>
groan was Sally's only answer as she turned away.</p>
          <p>Sally now began to wonder that she was
left so long undisturbed by her new master,
whom she knew to be extravagant and reckless.
A fear sometimes seized her heart that
She might by suddenly seized and sold as her
Children had been, but she tried to be hopeful,
And to banish it for the sake of her husband.
Alas! Her fears were not unfounded.</p>
          <p>One morning, about a year after Lewis was
sold, she had been to market as usual, and had
purchased a barrel of flour, which was standing
outside of the door. Two gentlemen
entered, and the girl who helped her being
busy, and supposing they wished to buy
cakes, and the girl who helped her being
busy, and supposing they wished to buy
cakes, called to her in the best room to come
and wait on them. She went out quickly,
but as they were looking about without speaking,
she took a chair and sat down, waiting
for their orders. At length one of them got
up and began to walk around. An undefined
terror seized her. Was she sold? Suddenly
he stopped before her, and looking her full in
the face said—</p>
          <p>“Sally, <hi rend="italics"><sic corr="you're">your're</sic> mine.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord! Whar do ye live?”</p>
          <pb id="sally98" n="98"/>
          <p>“I live down in Alabama.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, then,” said Sally, “I couldn't cry. 'Peared
like I was stunned, an' the life died out o' me. I
did jes' as he told me without sayin' a word. ‘You
must come along now,’ said he, ‘and I'll see about
your things afterward.’ So he took hold o' my arm
an' led me to the door, an' I walked along with him
like I was in a dream, till we got to de slave-pen,
an' den he pushed me in, an' looked me up wid de
rest.”</p>

          <p>As the door closed upon her purchaser, and
the terrible reality of her fate burst upon her,
Sally's unnatural calmness deserted her, and
she sank to the ground in a swoon. The
slave-pen was an enclosure of perhaps a hundred
feet square, surrounded by a high board
fence, and entered by a small gate or door.
In it, some thirty men, women, and children—
the men chained together, two by two—were
waiting their departure to the far south-west.
A dreadful scene it was. Some were cursing
and swearing, and some were rending the air
with their cries. There were wives torn from
their husbands, and husbands from their wives,
and children snatched from their parents, and
parents bereft of their children. Without,
many of their friends and acquaintances
were gathered, talking to them through the 
bars, some in anger and some in grief, which
could find no words for its expression. There
were two speculators in company; Sally's
purchaser, who attended to outside matters,
and who was naturally a kind-hearted man,
and another, who was wholly sordid and
unfeeling, and whose business it was to stay with
the slaves, and to act as overseer, keeping
them in order as he saw fit. He walked
<pb id="sally100" n="100"/>
among them, flourishing a whip in his hand, listening
to their conversation, and watching narrowly any
seeming attempt to escape.</p>
          <p>It was a bright day in June, and the country was in
its summer prime. All about them were cultivated
fields, and away in the distance the dark pine forests
stretched to the horizon. The boughs were full of
singing birds, and every breeze was odorous of roses
and jessamines, but in that little spot there was anguish
enough to shade the brightness of the world, and to
make all the angels weep as they looked down 
out of the clear heaven!</p>
          <p>In the loud talking and confusion of the place, Sally's
entrance was not noticed. She had lain for some time
unconscious, when the overseer observed her, and
brandishing his whip about her head, giving her at the
same time a slight kick with his heavy foot, he called
out, in a rough voice—</p>
          <p>“Come, wake up, old gal! Don't want no fainting
fits here; all my folks must be lively.”</p>
          <p>So rudely roused, Sally made an effort to sit up and
look about her, and as she did so, he turned away, and
was soon occupied in the distant corner. Poor Sally,
her heart sickened
<pb id="sally101" n="101"/>
at the scene before her, and she bowed 
her head upon her hands. Now and then 
some fearful oath came to her ear, and anon a 
piteous exclamation. She thought over all 
her life, from her childhood to this bitterest 
hour; a gloomy reach, with only here and 
there an illumined portion, like a November's 
day in northern latitudes, when black clouds 
hurry across the sky, and sunny gleams
appear only now and then between the shadows 
of the howling winds. Would the night 
never come?  She longed for death, and if, in 
her woeful state, she could have prayed, she 
would have besought the Lord that it might 
not tarry. She was roused from her reverie 
by the entrance of her purchaser. Seeing her 
sitting motionless where he had left her, he 
exclaimed, “Come, Sally, there's no use in 
grieving—what's done can't be helped. I'll 
take you back to the house now to pick up 
your things.”</p>
          <p>At these words, all the realities of her situation 
came vividly to her mind. She thought 
of her husband and of Isaac, and of her old 
mother, who was now owned by a gentleman 
a little way out of the town, and with a “Yes, 
mas'r,” she arose and followed him. On
<pb id="sally102" n="102"/>
through the streets they passed, and by the 
very market where she had that morning 
made her purchases with so much of 
independence and satisfaction. What a change 
had a few hours wrought. Now she was weak 
and dizzy, and led by a man who had over 
her absolute control. The real reason of her 
that her success and popularity had 
awakened so much envy and jealousy, that it 
was deemed expedient she should be removed. 
Alabama was then what Texas is now. Her 
peace and comfort were nothing compared to 
the safety of the cherished institution of 
slavery, and so they were sacrificed without 
one pang of remorse, as they have been thousands 
of times since her day. She was well 
known in Fayetteville, and the rumor of her 
sale spread rapidly through the town. As 
they passed on, such remarks as this fell upon 
her ear:</p>
          <p>“Good enough for her.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes; she's held her head rather too high.”</p>
          <p>“Ah! that's the way to take down your 
smart niggers. Reckon she wont be quite so 
much of a lady down in the Alabama clearings.”</p>
          <pb id="sally103" n="103"/>
          <p>But they were not all ill-natured remarks 
which she heard. In one group was a poor 
white woman with whom she had often shared 
her simple meal, and who was now protesting 
against her fate.</p>
          <p>“I tell you it's a mean shame. There 
aint a better woman in Fayetteville, white 
or black. Didn't she help me take care of 
Jimmy all through the fever last fall, and 
bring me a cup of coffee and a bit of bread 
whenever he was too sick for me to go to my 
day's work? I say we'd any of us better be 
sold than Sally. Any how, I believe she's 
got the Lord on her side.”</p>
          <p>These kind words touched Sally's heart, 
and for the first time that day the tears came 
to her eyes. <hi rend="italics">Was</hi> the Lord on her side? In 
the depths of her heart she prayed that He 
would not desert her in this most desperate 
hour. “Oh! Mas'r,” she cried, when she 
could speak, “I's willin' to go with ye if it's 
de Lord's will, but I'se got a son, my oldest 
chile, out on de Ridgely plantation, an' a little 
ways from him my ole mother, an' her I haint 
seen dis three years—if I could only bid 'em 
good bye!”</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally, if you'll be peaceable and not
<pb id="sally104" n="104"/>
make me any trouble, I'll send for 'em to 
come and see you to-morrow morning.”</p>
          <p>“Thank'ee, Mas'r,” was her grateful reply.</p>
          <p>When she reached her own house, how 
deserted did everything already look. The 
landlord had been there, and taken her 
newly-purchased barrel of flour for rent ; the young 
girl who assisted her had fled in affright and 
the rooms were in confusion. The speculator 
kept guard at the door, and called out to her 
to make haste and get ready her things. 
How hard it would have been to her to leave 
the various articles of household and personal 
comfort, which by hard labor she had 
gathered together, if her thoughts had not
been engrossed by greater sorrows. Only a
limited amount of' baggage could be carried 
on the long journey, and Sally was restricted 
to one trunk and a bag, a bed and a tub and 
a pail. The three last were speedily put in 
readiness, and then she prepared to fill the 
trunk and the bag with her clothing. One 
thing after another was taken from the drawers 
and folded away, and when she came to 
Isaac's Bible, she placed it in the bag, that 
she might give it to him on the morrow. 
While thus employed, her husband suddenly
<pb id="sally105" n="105"/>
entered the house. He was away at his work 
when the news of her sale reached him, and, 
almost beside himself, he had hurried home 
to see her once more. Superior to him in 
thought and energy, he regarded her with a 
kind of veneration, and was weak as a child 
at the thought of losing her.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Sally, ye shan't go. I can't live without 
ye. I'll tell dat ar cursed speculator to”——</p>
          <p>“Don't go on so, Lewis, I can't bar it; I 
specs it's de Lord dat sends him.”</p>
          <p>“Sally, ye know I's got some money dat I's 
been savin', an' I know where there's them 
that'll lend me some more. I'll buy ye of 
him;” and he went to the door and offered 
the man two hundred and fifty dollars, the 
price he had paid for his wife; and when 
this was refused, three hundred dollars was 
proffered, with the promise that the money 
should be paid to him that very evening.</p>
          <p>“There's no use talking about it,” said the 
speculator, “money can't alter this transaction. 
Sally's going to Alabama, and you may 
as well be quiet about it.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord Jesus!” gasped Sally, as the
<pb id="sally106" n="106"/>
words reached her through the open door,
“go thar with me!”</p>
          <p>Half frantic, her husband came back, and 
now raving, and now embracing her he 
watched her lay the last things into the 
trunk upon the floor. “What do ye carry 
yer clothes for, Sally'? He'll sell 'em to get 
grain for his cursed horses. I wouldn't take 
any thing but what I had on my back.”</p>
          <p>At this moment the speculator called out to 
know if Sally was ready, and hastily fastening 
the trunk, and leaving it with the other 
things which were to be conveyed to the 
wagon, and taking the bag in her hand, she 
went out, saying to her husband, “Bar it as 
well's ye ken, Lewis, an' cum an' see me in 
de mornin'.”</p>
          <p>Eve was not sadder at leaving Paradise 
than was Sally when she stepped, for the last 
time, over the threshold of that humble 
dwelling, where had passed the only bright days 
she had ever known. Twilight was fast fading, 
and the hush of a tranquil summer night 
was settling upon the town. Who could have 
thought so much of anguish was in human 
hearts on such an eve! Silently they walked 
on, Sally and her master. At the corner of
<pb id="sally107" n="107"/>
one of the streets she was accosted by a 
colored man named White, who had always 
been very friendly to her. Just as he passed 
her he said, in a low tone, which was unheard 
by her companion, “I shall come up to de 
yard to see ye in de evenin'.” When they 
reached the slave-pen, it was quite dark, but 
out by the wagons a huge fire was burning, 
and its ruddy glow shone even on the faces 
of the poor creatures within the enclosure. 
Most of them were sleeping, worn out with 
the misery of the day. Sally took the most 
quiet corner, and laying her bag down against 
the fence, had composed herself as well as she 
was able, when she heard some one speaking
through the bars. It was White. He
had come to tell her that the speculators, 
having locked the door, had gone away for a 
little while, and that if she would wait till 
they were all asleep, and the fire had burnt 
low, she could climb over the fence and 
escape. A wild hope of freedom sprung up 
within her, and she embraced it as eagerly as 
an imprisoned bird that had beat its wings 
hopelessly against unyielding walls, would fly 
to an open window which revealed the sunny 
sky. Carefully she took the clothes from her
<pb id="sally108" n="108"/>
bag and passed them, piece by piece, through 
the crack to her friend without, and then, 
when all was quiet, and the firelight glow had 
faded, she tried to mount the high fence that
she might let herself down upon the other 
side. A difficult thing it was. Two or three
times she almost succeeded, and then fell
frightened back upon the ground. Just as
she was about to attempt it again, in a different 
manner, the bolt of the door was suddenly 
withdrawn, and she knew that the 
master had returned, and that all was over.
So quietly she lay down, and closing her eyes
as if in sleep, resigned herself to her fate.</p>
          <p>The morning dawned bright and beautiful
on the fields, and wan and wretched on that 
imprisoned band. The slave train was to leave
before noon, and life-long leave-takings
must be crowded into these brief hours. Only
a favored few were permitted to enter the
yard; most of the poor creatures were standing
by the fence, talking through it to their
friends without, strangely intermingling oaths
and sobs and loving words. Here and there
one was heard calling upon God, and committing
a friend to his care, but most of them
seemed desperate and reckless in their woe.
<pb id="sally109" n="109"/>
Sally stood, looking out between the boards, 
to see if, among the multitude, she could 
discern her mother or her child. The sun rose 
high in heaven, and the dew forsook the 
grass, but still they did not come. She began 
to fear they had not been sent for, when, 
hastening through the crowd, she saw a tall 
and comely boy leading an old woman by the 
hand, whom she knew to be her son and her mother.</p>
          <p>Calling to them that they might know 
where to find her, she sat down by the largest 
opening in the boards, and gazed out upon 
them as if all of life were in her eyes. Her
old mother was growing childish, and her 
heart was almost broken at parting from 
Sally, who was her only daughter and her 
pride. Her screams and groans were agonizing 
to hear, and pierced poor Sally's heart 
with a keener sorrow. Isaac seemed quite 
stunned and silenced by the blow, but deep 
thoughts were at work within him, and he 
was forming resolutions which were to 
influence his future life. Among the slave 
company was a young girl of good disposition 
and character, named Charlotte Rives. The 
grandmother know her, and begged Sally, as
<pb id="sally110" n="110"/>
she desired the blessing of the Lord, to watch 
over and protect her. While they stood thus 
talking, Sally's husband made his way to the 
group, with wild, sad face, that betrayed a 
night of pain. He gave her a small parcel, 
saying, “There's a new dress for ye, Sally. 
When ye got to Alabama, if ye think it'll do 
for me to come, find somebody to write to me, 
an' I'll surely go to ye.”</p>
          <p>“I will, Lewis, I will. I'll pray to de Lord 
to let ye come.”</p>
          <p>“Sally, I can't stay to see ye go. It would 
kill me. If ye hear any thing from little 
Lewis, send it to me in de letter. Farwell!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, God o' mercy, farwell, farwell!” said 
Sally, as they wrung each other's hands, and 
parted.</p>
          <p>There was a great commotion now about 
the yard; then the door was opened, and the 
speculators entered, and took out first the 
chained men, whom they arranged in marching 
order, and then the women and children 
followed. Last of all came Sally, and as soon 
as she was without the door, her mother and 
her son clasped her in their arms. White, 
upon some pretext, had brought her bag to 
her again, and now, drawing from it the
<pb id="sally111" n="111"/>
precious Bible, she put it into Isaac's hand,
saying—</p>
          <p>“Read it every day, chile, an' pray to de 
Lord to guide ye. 'Pears like he'll take care 
of ye. If ye see yer brother Daniel, tell him 
his mother loves him, an' wants him allers to 
be a good boy.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, mother,” said she to the old woman,
“you'se been a good mother to me, an I can't 
half thank ye for it. Don't take on for me. 
De Lord'll bless ye, an' bring us all together, 
I hopes, in de Kingdom.”</p>
          <p>Around Sally stood many of her acquaintances, 
who had been accustomed to attend the 
same meeting with her, and who prized her 
friendship, and had come out from Fayetteville 
to bid her adieu. Some were weeping, 
some invoking God's blessing upon her, and 
one was improvizing, in a minor strain, a song 
which began—</p>
          <lg type="song">
            <l>“Sister, far'well! I bid ye adieu,</l>
            <l>I'm sorry to leave ye, I lub ye so well;</l>
            <l>But now you are going to whar I dunno;</l>
            <l>When ye get to yer station, pray for poor me!”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>But now the train was ready, and the 
impatient patient overseer called out to Sally, “Come, 
hurry up there! You'll have time enough to
<pb id="sally112" n="112"/>
cry on the road.” One last embrace, and the 
mother and daughter and son tore themselves 
from each other's arms, casting back agonized 
glances as they moved away. Suddenly, the 
old woman broke from her grandchild's hold, 
and running after her daughter, untied her 
checked apron from her waist, and threw it 
toward her, asking her own in exchange, 
which was given. Simple pledge! yet was it 
as dear to them as if it had been a girdle of 
gems.</p>
          <p>“Far'well, far'well, the Lord bless ye,” 
they cried, till their voices grew faint in the 
distance, and then the grandmother and the 
boy returned to their respective masters, and 
Sally went forward to unknown lands.</p>

          <p>IN the slave-coffle were about twenty men,
with three women—Sally, the young girl 
Charlotte and an old woman named Hagar, 
whom the speculator had bought at a 
bargain, and five small children. The men were 
chained together, two by two, but Hagar was 
docile from age and habit, and Charlotte from 
youth and inexperience, and there was a kind 
of dignity about Sally which made her new 
master dislike to put her in irons; so that, 
contrary to the usual custom, all three were 
left unshackled. The speculators rode in a 
light carriage, and a large wagon, drawn by 
horses, contained the baggage of the
<pb id="sally114" n="114"/>
company. The children took turns in riding in 
the wagon, and now and then the privilege 
was extended to one of the women. What a 
hopeless company it was that dragged its 
weary way through the pine forests to the far 
southwest! All had been torn from home 
and friends, and were going every hour 
further from what they hold dear. Is it strange 
that their steps were slow, and that every 
gloomy and evil passion was aroused in their 
hearts?</p>
          <p>Poor Sally had borne up bravely hitherto 
under her successive trials, and had still 
looked forward with something of hope to 
the future, but this was too much, even for
her endurance; and when the last farewell 
was over, her heart died within her, and a 
darkness, which might be felt, settled down 
upon her soul. She thought God had 
forsaken her, and she dared not pray. One 
only desire filled her mind, and that was to 
escape from her master, and find her way 
back to her dear old home. The first day 
they advanced about ten miles, and encamped 
for the night in a little opening among the 
pines. A heap of light-wood was soon 
collected, and a blazing fire kindled. The meal
<pb id="sally115" n="115"/>
and water were given to the women to mix 
for bread, which was baked in the ashes and 
then divided, with a small piece of bacon for 
each, among the company. But this was not 
the white men's fare—oh, no! They had 
wheaten bread and crackers, and a pot of 
coffee boiled for them upon the glowing coals, 
of which the negroes could only inhale the 
delicious fragrance. They ate their delicate 
bread and drank their coffee, seeing their 
captives the while devouring the coarse cake, 
with as much indifference and unconsciousness 
of injustice as you would have in sitting 
at a luxurious table and watching your dog 
picking the bones at your feet. When the 
meal was over, the men were chained to the
trunks of trees, and to the wheels of the 
wagon, and the women and children lay down 
beneath the shelter of the tent. So closely 
were they watched by the overseer, that they 
had little opportunity, to speak privately to 
each other, but Sally had the young girl 
Charlotte by her side; and whispering to her 
to keep awake, she waited until all was still 
but the heavy breathing of her companions, 
and then motioned to her to steal out after 
her into the open air. She was only ten
<pb id="sally116" n="116"/>
miles from Fayetteville; she would never be 
so near it again, and the thought made her 
desperate to return. Silently they crept along,
startled by every wind that stirred the pine 
boughs, and halted between each stop to 
listen. They had passed the tents and the 
wagon, and were just striking into the forest, 
when they heard voices. Just at that 
moment, the fire caught a new faggot, and, by 
the blaze, they saw the two speculators 
sitting over the embers, closely engaged in 
conversation. Sally was so frightened that she 
stepped hastily forward, treading upon a dry 
branch, which broke with a crackling noise.</p>
          <p>“Who's there?” called out the overseer, as 
both he and his companion rose and advanced 
quickly toward the wood.</p>
          <p>“Oh, mas'r,” said Sally, more dead than 
alive, “it's only me an' Charlotte; we's jes' 
gwine to de spring for some water—dat's all.”</p>
          <p>“Don't tell me none of your lies,” screamed 
the overseer; “I know what you're after, and 
I know what you'll get, too!” and he shook 
his fist in her face.</p>
          <p>“Hush, Jones, let her alone,” said the 
speculator; never mind about the water to-night, 
Sally go back and lie down with the rest.”</p>
          <pb id="sally117" n="117"/>
          <p>“Yes, mas'r,” said Sally, thankful to escape, 
as she slunk back with the girl to her old 
place in the tent. </p>
          <p>“She deserves a hundred lashes, Leland,” 
said the overseer, as she turned away, “and 
if I had my way, she'd get 'em. You know 
she meant to run off.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I s'pose she did, and I don't wonder 
at it. I tell you, she was better off than we 
are, and it's mighty hard to be broken up in 
this way. I can't afford to lose her, but I
won't have her whipped for trying to run
away. Now remember.”</p>
          <p>“I should like to know how such a 
chicken-hearted man as you come to be in this 
business, any way?”</p>
          <p>“I was brought up to it; my father was in 
it before me, but I'm sick of it sometimes, 
that's a fact.” And he walked slowly and 
thoughtfully to his tent. Poor man! He
had moments of great uneasiness, for his 
heart was yet tender. But interest and 
custom were stronger than his sense of right; 
so, after a little disquiet, he lay down and 
slept soundly in the midst of his victims.</p>
          <p>What a night was that for Sally! In her 
dreams she lived over the day, and Isaac's
<pb id="sally118" n="118"/>
agonized face was before her, and her mother's 
scream and her husband's farewell rang in 
her ears. Bewildered and feverish she awoke. 
The sun had not yet risen, but the camp was 
astir, that they might be on their way before 
the heat of noon. A breakfast, like their 
evening meal, and then the tents were folded, 
and the day's march began.</p>
          <p>Fifteen miles a day was their average travel.
In the first thirty miles out of Fayetteville,
they met several country farmers going into
town with their produce. Some of them 
Sally knew, having had dealings with them 
in the market. They looked wonderingly at 
her as they passed, while she, poor soul, as 
road, was almost tempted to break from the 
line, and follow after them, even though she 
should be shot down in the attempt. All other 
feelings were swallowed up in her one desire to 
escape. If their path led through the forest, 
she wondered if she could not steal away 
under its shadow, and at night she lay awake 
for hours, trying to think of some plan by 
which to fly and elude pursuit. Siberia never 
fell colder and more fearful upon the ear and 
heart of the departing exile than did Alabama
<pb id="sally119" n="119"/>
upon hers. She remembered the story of the 
flight of the Israelites from Egypt, and she 
sometimes thought, perhaps, the Lord would 
appear for her and give her a marvelous 
deliverance. But day succeeded day, in 
monotonous travel, bearing her farther and 
farther from home, and affording her neither 
opportunity nor pretext for retracing her 
steps. She did not quite despair, however, 
but, every night, when she lay down by the 
camp-fire, she hoped something would happen 
to favor her on the morrow.</p>
          <p>Five lingering weeks had passed, and the 
train had wound its toilsome way quite across 
the Carolinas to the Savannah River, which, 
swollen by recent rains, rolled its black
waters, flecked with foam, downward to the sea. 
They halted on its banks to prepare for the 
crossing. The carriage and baggage-wagon 
were to go over a ferry at some distance 
above, but the expense was thought too great 
for the party to be conveyed in this way, and 
so it was decided that they should ford the 
stream. At this a dreadful consternation 
seized the slaves. Naturally timid, and from 
their field life unaccustomed to the water, 
they feared to encounter its rushing tide.
<pb id="sally120" n="120"/>
Shrieks and curses were heard among them, 
and the jaded limbs of many a stout man 
quaked in his fetters. The speculator was to 
go by the ferry, and was giving the overseer 
some directions about their place of meeting, 
when Sally stepped forward and said, in a 
trembling voice,</p>
          <p>“Please, mas'r, what river is dis?”</p>
          <p>“It's the Savannah river, Sally.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, mas'r! have we done got past Car'lina?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Sally, you've seen the last of it.”</p>
          <p>“Is dat ar Alabama?” pointing across the river.</p>
          <p>“Oh, bless you, no. That's Georgia. We've 
got hundreds of miles to go yet.”</p>
          <p>Sally could not speak, for such a faintness
came over her that she thought she was dying. 
With the word Carolina was associated all 
she knew of home and place, and Georgia 
and Alabama were as vague and indefinite as 
if they had been in another world. But there 
was no time to waste in thought. The women 
and children were made to go first into the 
stream, followed by the men, who were 
fastened together in a line, and ordered to assist 
them. At the first plunge into the water, they 
screamed and almost fell down in their fear,
<pb id="sally121" n="121"/>
but the overseer was behind them on horseback,
shouting and swearing and urging them 
on. Desperation was in their hearts, and no 
ray of hope lighted up their future. Most 
of them would rather have died than gone 
forward to the misery beyond, and tried to 
bury themselves beneath the water, but some 
were afraid of death, and struggled madly to 
keep above the waves; so with cries from 
the half-drowning women and children, and 
oaths and fierce wranglings among the men, 
at last, panting and exhausted, they reached 
the Georgia shore.</p>
          <p>Sally looked back at Carolina, sleeping in 
the afternoon sun, and knew she never should 
see it more, because that fearful river could 
not be crossed again. “Oh, then,” said she, 
“ 'peared like something burst inside of me, 
and I gin up altogether.”</p>
          <p>And now the most toilsome part of the 
journey commenced, for all hope of escape 
was gone, and they were exhausted by previous 
travel. New scenes were about them. 
The pine groves of the Fayetteville region 
had given place to the more varied forests 
of Georgia. A richer vegetation clothed the 
earth, and flowers and birds, which they
<pb id="sally122" n="122"/>
had never seen before, made the woodlands
gay.</p>
          <p>But Sally went forward unconscious, like
one in a dream, and old Hagar, whose 
husband was in Carolina, and Charlotte, who had
left a loving mother, wept and bemoaned their
fate at every stop of the way. The children
were now carried constantly in the wagon,
and the speculator, finding that the women
were failing, and that their feet were bruised
and swollen, ordered that they should take
turns in riding also; and because the wagon
was overloaded, sometimes gave up the 
carriage to them and walked himself. The men,
who had no such relief, but must plod on from
day to day, began to suffer exceedingly from
the chafing of their fetters, and the master
determined to have them exchanged for lighter
ones, at the first opportunity. Their way lay
mostly through forests and thinly settled 
districts, but, after a few days, they reached a
village where was a blacksmith's shop, erected
on purpose to shoe the horses and repair the
irons of the slave-gangs which passed that
way. They halted in front of it, and the
negroes, throwing themselves upon the grass,
were taken, two by two, into the shop, and
<pb id="sally123" n="123"/>
their fetters exchanged for those which were 
easier to wear. In the village was a minister,
a true gospel preacher, whose heart was
wrung by the scenes which almost daily passed 
before his eyes on this great thoroughfare. 
As he glanced from his window in the hot 
noon, and saw the slaves lying there looking 
so spent and worn, with the chains about 
their ankles, his whole soul was moved, and, 
coming out of his house, he hastily crossed 
the road to where the speculator was sitting 
under a tree, and began to expostulate with 
him, and to set before him the enormity of 
the traffic in which he was engaged.</p>
          <p>“What you say is all true, sir,” said Leland;
“but I was raised in the business, and if I 
don't take 'em down, somebody else will. I 
assure you I treat 'em well. I drive the best 
gangs that go into Alabama. There's a proof 
of what I say, sir; their irons were too heavy 
for comfort, and, at considerable expense to 
myself, I'm having lighter ones made for 'em.”</p>
          <p>“I see you're a kind-hearted man, and the 
last one that should be in a trade like this—
driving men and women in chains through
<pb id="sally124" n="124"/>
the country like so many cattle. You believe 
they have souls, don't you?”</p>
          <p>“Souls? I sometimes think their souls are 
a great deal bigger than ours. There's that 
woman, Sally, leaning against the tree 
yonder—she's got more soul than a dozen of 
some white women I know.”</p>
          <p>“And yet you can buy and sell them as if 
they were blocks of wood! I tell you, you 
are committing a fearful crime. God's word 
is against you, and the judgment day will be 
against you, when you stand there with them 
to give an account of your lives.”</p>
          <p>“Bless me, sir, no, minister ever talked 
so to me before. I had a good many such 
thoughts myself; last year, after having a 
great fuss at the sale of one of my gangs, so 
I wont to my minister in Alabama and asked 
him what he thought about it? ‘O,’ said he, 
‘these are unavoidable evils, and the world is 
full of them every where. There's no doubt 
that slavery is a divine institution, and if you 
do the best you can, you needn't give yourself 
any trouble about the matter.’ I was 
quieted for the time, but ever since I bought 
Sally, I've been thinking the same things 
again; and I believe you're right.”</p>
          <pb id="sally125" n="125"/>
          <p>“Then why not give up this cursed business, 
and do what you can to atone for your past life?”</p>
          <p>“Well, to tell you the truth, sir, I'm poor, 
and if I don't make well on this lot, I shall 
surely fail and lose every thing I've got in 
the world. The fact is, I never could bear 
to buy and sell as most traders do, and so I 
never make much money any way. But I 
promise you, sir, if I can pay my debts when 
these are sold, and I'll try to get them all 
good places, I never'll buy another man, 
woman, or child as long as I live, for, as you 
say, it's a cursed business.”</p>
          <p>The new irons being all adjusted, the line 
of march was again taken up. The speculator 
showed his sincerity by proceeding with 
more care, and paying greater attention to 
the food and rest of his company. Sally's 
distress of mind had so affected her health that 
she was obliged to give up walking altogether. 
She grew thin, her appetite failed, and her 
master feared she would not live till they 
reached their destination.</p>
          <p>“Come, Sally,” he would say to her, “cheer 
up. I'm going to keep you myself. I've no
<pb id="sally126" n="126"/>
idea of selling you. By-and-by, perhaps, I'll 
take you to see Lewis at Clairborne.”</p>
          <p>At this she would smile faintly, and say,
“Thank'ee, mas'r,” and then relapse into her 
old indifference. At length they entered 
Alabama, and when she heard where they were, 
she burst into tears, and sobbed so violently 
that they thought she would die. Her master 
begged her to compose herself, but her 
grief would have its way. She refused to be 
comforted, and every few hours would moan 
and weep afresh, until they reached the house 
of the speculator, where the slaves were to be 
kept till he could dispose of them to his liking.</p>

          <p>THE home of the speculator was on the 
Alabama river, about two hundred miles 
above Mobile. He had inherited the place 
from his father. It had a neglected look, and
the house was going to decay, yet it was 
more attractive than most of the residences 
in that vicinity. There were ample grounds 
about it; and live oak and magnolia trees, 
rising here and there in stately proportions, 
atoned for the dilapidated appearance of the 
mansion. Leland was naturally a man of 
generous impulse, and fine sensibility, but he 
had been reared to his business by his father, 
who was utterly devoid of principle, and his 
whole life had been a contest between habit
<pb id="sally128" n="128"/>
		
and interest, and his interior sense of right.  
His convictions of wrong-doing were just weak 
enough to prevent him from abandoning his 
trade, and just strong enough to keep him 
from making it profitable. So he went on 
from year to year buying and selling, but 
always growing poorer. His wife was a meek, 
gentle woman, who had no thought aside from 
her husband's opinion, and his only child was 
a bright, sweet-tempered girl of twelve years
—her mother's oracle and her father's pride. 
If any one wanted a favor of Leland, it was 
the safest way to approach him through “Miss Bessie.”</p>
          <p>The sun was just setting on a sultry August 
evening, as the master, with his weary 
company, reached his own domain. Leaving the 
negroes in charge of the overseer, he rode 
hastily up the carriage way, and was greeted 
at the door with joyous acclamations by his 
daughter, and timid delight by his wife. The 
negro quarters were in the rear of the house, 
and in a few minutes Jones appeared, leading 
their new occupants thither.</p>
          <p>“How is it, Mary,” said Leland, as they
passed-by, “do you want any help in the house?”</p>
          <pb id="sally129" n="129"/>
          <p>“Why, yes, George,” said his wife, “we 
really need a cook. It seems like I've had 
nothing but trouble with Sue since you went 
away.”</p>
          <p>“Well, then, there's just the woman for 
you. I bought her in Fayetteville; she kept 
a cake shop there, but she's sick, Mary, she's 
sick and miserable,—and you'd better take 
her right into the house and attend to her. 
Her master would sell her because every body 
said she was doing too well for a nigger. I 
declare, I never felt so bad in my life as I 
have for her, and if I can, I mean to keep her 
and use her well.”</p>
          <p>“O father!” said Bessie, who stood by,
“may I run and tell her she's to come to the 
house, and not to be sold any more?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Bessie; cheer her up, if you can.”</p>
          <p>With light foot the little girl ran to the 
cabin appropriated to the women, and looking 
in, saw Sally lying on the rude bed, the 
picture of despair.</p>
          <p>“Don't feel bad, Aunty,” said she, as she 
put her little white hand in Sally's; “my 
father says you shall live with us in the 
house, and nobody shall carry you away.”</p>
          <p>Sally was too wretched and hopeless to 
<pb id="sally130" n="130"/>
speak. She wished she might be left alone to 
die. She was like one who has gone through 
the agonies of dissolution in drowning, and to 
whom any attempt at restoration is painful. 
But the caressing hand and the kind words 
went to her heart in spite of herself, and she wept.</p>
          <p>A few days of rest and kind nursing quite improved
Sally's bodily health; but her greatest 
trouble was at heart. She thought she 
was abandoned of God, and that He had never 
loved her, or He would not have sent her such 
trials. There was no one to speak to her of 
Jesus, or to remind her that “whom the Lord 
loveth, He chasteneth,” and so she went on, 
bearing this grievious burden in silence and 
alone. As soon as she was able, the cooking 
was given into her charge, and Charlotte was 
taken to the kitchen to assist her. Her new 
master's affairs were in a desperate condition. 
He had gone on his last trading expedition, 
determined, if possible, to retrieve his 
fortunes; but the incidents of the journey, the 
purchase of Sally, and the reproof of the 
minister, had aroused his slumbering 
conscience, and called forth all that was generous 
in his nature; and he was resolved not to
<pb id="sally131" n="131"/>
part with his negroes except to their advantage
as well as his own. So, instead of selling 
them at public auction, he sent privately to 
those whom he thought likely to buy and to 
prove good masters, and invited them to come 
and inspect the “lot” on his own premises. 
And now he realized, as he had never done
before, the horrors of that institution which 
he had been helping to maintain. It began 
to be a fearful thing to him to have the 
destiny of human beings in his hands. The 
levity with which the subject was treated 
was painful to him, and the oaths and coarse 
jokes of the buyers grated upon his ears. And 
thus it came to pass, that although every day 
was increasing his financial difficulties, weeks 
ran into months, and only five men and two 
children out of the company were sold.</p>
          <p>Sally's position was one of comparative 
comfort. Her master and mistress treated 
her with uniform kindness and respect; and 
sweet Bessie always had a smile for “Aunty,” 
as she called her. The burden had not gone 
from her heart, but she had grown calm; and 
with her keen eye she looked around and 
calculated the chances of her future. She had 
seen more than one family's pecuniary ruin,
<pb id="sally132" n="132"/>
and the disaster it occasioned, and she foresaw 
that this would be her new master's fate, so 
she took her present place much as a traveler 
across a burning desert would take a little 
oasis which he know he must shortly leave 
for the pathless sand. She remembered her
husband's promise to come to her if she would
send for him, and watched narrowly to know 
if it were best. She saw that slavery there 
was, in some respects, a different thing from 
what even her experience had made it in 
Carolina. The ties of affection and mutual 
dependence which at home often bound 
master and slaves together, seemed there no
where to exist, but to give place to a forced
and cheerless servitude; above all, she noticed
that free negroes were always spoken of and 
treated with contempt. So, bitter as was the 
alternative, she resolved to send word to her 
husband to remain in Fayetteville, where he 
was known, and where he could at least earn a 
comfortable and independent living. It was the 
close of a bright day in winter. Sally's 
work was done, and she was sitting before the 
kitchen fire, as she always sat now when not 
employed, in a kind of dream or stupor, 
hopeless, but uncomplaining. Suddenly the
<pb id="sally133" n="133"/>
door opened, and Bessie entered with a 
beaming face.</p>
          <p>Oh, Aunty! I've got something to tell you.
There's been a trader from Mobile here to
see father, to-day, and there was one of your
nice pound-cakes on the dinner table; and he 
said to mamma, ‘Why, where did you get 
such a cook, Mrs. Leland?” Then father told 
him about you, and when he had done, the 
man said you was just such a cook as he 
wanted to take down to Mobile, and that he'd 
give six hundred dollars for you. But my 
father said he wouldn't sell you, for he meant 
to have your bones laid on the same plantation 
with his; and I was so glad, Aunty, I 
ran out to tell you. What were you thinking 
about when I came in here?”</p>
          <p>“Bless you, chile, you's very good to me. 
I was thinkin' 'bout my husband 'way back in 
Car'lina. I promised to send him word 'bout 
comin' down here, but 'pears like dis ain't no 
place for him. I's bid far'well to him an' 
all de chil'n, an' now 'pears like dey'd better 
leave me 'lone. If I could only get a letter 
writ to him!”</p>
          <p>“Why, Aunty, I can write you a letter. 
I've written three all alone; two to my
<pb id="sally134" n="134"/>
teacher, Miss Martin, she's gone to Mississippi, 
now, and one to my grand'ma in 
Tennessee. I'll go right and ask my father 
for some paper and his pen.”</p>
          <p>In a few minutes she returned, and, sitting 
down, wrote, with great care, a few lines, to 
Sally's dictation, directing the note to “Lewis 
Beggs, Fayetteville, North Carolina.”</p>
          <p>“There, now! Isn't that nice? I'll ask 
my father to take it to the postoffice the next 
time he goes over there. Do n't you want me 
to write another to your little boy down in 
Claiborne?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Miss Bessie, I dunno whar he is. He 
was a peart little thing! Is Claiborne a 
great ways off?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know. It's somewhere by Mobile, 
aint it? When my father goes down there 
again, I'll ask him to take you and me, and 
then we can find out his master and see him. 
If I was only a grown up woman, I'd send 
for your husband and all your children, and 
you should live in my house and have good times.”</p>
          <p>“De Lord bless ye, honey! Dere aint no 
more good times for me nowhar!” and Sally 
relapsed into her melancholy silence, while
<pb id="sally135" n="135"/>
Bessie, sad and uncertain what to do, stole 
out of the kitchen.</p>
          <p>A few days after this, Sally was called to 
the sitting-room by her master. “There, 
Sally,” said he, “Here's one of your old 
Fayetteville neighbors.”</p>
          <p>Sally looked up and saw before her Mr. 
Wayne, a gentleman who had often purchased 
cakes and coffee at her stall, but had been 
some months absent from Fayetteville, and 
had not heard of her sale.</p>
          <p>“Why, Sally!” he exclaimed, “I'm astonished 
to see you down here. Where's your husband?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, mas'r Wayne, it does my heart good 
to see ye! He's back in Car'lina. 'Pears 
like dat's do best place for him. I jes' sent 
him a letter to stay whar he is.”</p>
          <p>“That's right. Upon my word,” turning 
to Leland, “this is too bad. There wasn't 
a working woman in Fayetteville doing as well 
as she was. If I could afford it, I'd take her 
back again. Sally, do you want to send any 
word home?”</p>
          <p>“Thank'ee, mas'r Wayne. Will ye please to 
tell Lewis, dat 'taint because I don't love him 
dat I sent him de letter, but 'cause I knows
<pb id="sally136" n="136"/>
he's better off whar he is; an' if ye see Isaac 
an' Daniel, tell 'em their mother never forgets 
em, never. Oh, mas'r Wayne, dere's one thing 
more,” and the tears ran down her sunken 
cheeks, “'pears like I's lost de Lord in my 
troubles. Will ye go to de meetin' sometime 
Sunday afternoon, an' ask my ole friends to 
pray for me? I's parted with my home an' 
my husband, an' my chil'en, <hi rend="italics">but I mus' hold 
on to de Lord!”</hi></p>
          <p>Shaking her hand, and promising faithfully 
to deliver her messages, Mr. Wayne set out 
for Fayetteville. One morning, when he had 
accomplished about half the journey, as he 
was riding leisurely along through the forest, 
he saw approaching him, on foot, a negro, 
with a bundle slung over his shoulder. As 
he came nearer, he was surprised to see that 
it was Sally's husband.</p>
          <p>“Why, Beggs,” he exclaimed, “is that you? 
I saw Sally, down in Alabama, and she told 
me she had sent you a letter not to come 
there, because she know you was better off 
where you were. I tell you the black folks 
don't fare as well down south as they do in 
our quarters; and as for the free negroes they 
hate 'em. I'm sorry for you—there are not
<pb id="sally137" n="137"/>
many such women as Sally, but my advice to 
you is, to turn round and go home, and be 
contented.”</p>
          <p>Poor Lewis! Almost heart-broken after 
Sally's departure, he had resolved to
search of her, come what would, and had gone 
thus far on the toilsome journey when this 
intelligence reached him. Despairingly, he 
retraced his steps, and after many weeks 
reached Fayetteville, thin and feeble.
He had never possessed much energy of character 
and now, having no motive for sobriety 
and industry he became a confirmed drunkard, 
and in a short time died miserably, and 
was buried in a pauper's grave. It was years 
afterward before Sally heard of his
melancholy fate.</p>

          <p>IT was February. Trouble had thickened 
round Leland till it became certain that if the 
slaves were not disposed of within a limited 
time, they would be taken for debt by the 
sheriff, and sold at public auction. So deeply 
was he involved, that it was impossible for 
him to retain one for himself, and he determined, 
first of all, to provide the best home in
<pb id="sally139" n="139"/>
his power for Sally, He knew an enterprising 
man in Dallas county, by the name of Cone, 
who had purchased new lands, and was about
clearing them and bringing them under 
cultivation, and whom he thought would be likely 
to need more help. So he sent a messenger to 
tell him about her, and ask him to come over 
and see her for himself, which he promised to 
do. True to his word, the next day, about 
noon, he rode up to the house. He was a 
man of good sense and intelligence, and of a 
kind heart, but violent and unreasonable when 
roused to anger. Dismounting from his horse, 
Leland met him and took him aside for conversation.</p>
          <p>“My wife wants a seamstress, Leland,” said 
he; “does Sally understand sewing?” </p>
          <p>“I can tell you this, sir. When I went to 
her house in Fayetteville, I saw a nice silk 
dress, upon which she was working, lying on 
the table, and I was told that she was in the 
habit of making dresses, and doing all kinds 
of work for people, when she had leisure. I 
assure you she's a, treasure, and it's mighty 
hard for me to give her up. I wouldn't if I 
wasn't obliged to. But come into the house 
and judge for yourself.”</p>
          <pb id="sally140" n="140"/>
          <p>So saying, he led the way into the parlor 
and asked his wife to send for Sally, upon 
some pretext, that Mr. Cone might see her. 
One of the young negroes was dispatched for 
Sally, who soon appeared. Her mistress 
detained her for several minutes, giving her 
directions about her work. It was an unusual 
thing; and, looking up, she saw Mrs. Leland's 
embarrassment, and Mr. Cone's eager gaze, 
and at once the truth flashed upon her mind.</p>
          <p>“Oh, mas'r!” she exclaimed in a voice of 
agony, “Is I sold? Ye told me I should live 
an' die with ye.”</p>
          <p>“Sally, God knows my heart, I meant you 
should; but I've lost every thing I own in the 
world, and if I don't sell you, the sheriff 
will.”</p>
          <p>“Has it come to dat, mas'r? Well, de Lord's 
will be done!”</p>
          <p>She turned away, but in a moment came 
back again with streaming eyes. “Oh, mas'r! 
I promised my ole mother dat I'd look after 
Charlotte, like she was one o' my own chil'en. 
'Pears like I could bar it better if ye'd sell her 
with me.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Cone,” said Leland, “she was the girl 
you saw by the kitchen, when we came in.
<pb id="sally141" n="141"/>
She's young and likely, and if you'll take 
her, you shall have her at a bargain, for 
Sally's sake.”</p>
          <p>After a little conversation, Mr. Cone agreed 
to purchase them both, and it was arranged 
that he should send a man for them the next 
morning.</p>
          <p>It was evening, and Sally sat, as usual, by 
the kitchen fire, thinking of the change which 
awaited her, and wondering what dreadful sin 
she had committed, that the Lord sent her 
such afflictions. She -was like a plant rudely
torn from its native earth, and set in strange 
soil, where it has hardly begun to send forth
a few nourishing roots below, and to expand
a few leaf-buds above, ere it is removed to a 
new parterre. She longed for little Bessie's 
sympathy, but she had gone to her grandmother's, 
in Tennessee. Charlotte was with 
her, but she was too young and inexperienced 
to anticipate the future with much anxiety. 
She wished she could pray, as she once had 
done, but her trust and peace of mind were 
gone. The embers had grown dim, and she 
rose to lie down to sleep for the last time in 
that familiar room, when the door swung
<pb id="sally142" n="142"/>
open, and, looking up, she saw her master 
enter, pale and dejected.</p>
          <p>“Sally,” said he, “you don't feel worse 
about this than I do. God forgive me for 
ever taking you away from Carolina.”</p>
          <p>“Oh! mas'r, 't want you, 't was de Lord dat 
did it, an' I must be willin' to bar whatever 
He sends.”</p>
          <p>“Will you forgive me, Sally, for bringing
you to so much trouble?”</p>
          <p>“I'se nothin' to forgive, mas'r, you'se been 
very good to me. Don't be grievin' about it, 
it's de Lord's will.”</p>
          <p>“Good night, Sally;” and he extended his 
hand. “Good night, you've taught me more 
than all the ministers.”</p>
          <p>“God bless you, mas'r! good night.”</p>
          <p>Early the next morning Sally and Charlotte 
were on their way to their new home. They 
rode in a sort of lumber-wagon, which carried 
also their baggage. A few miles through the 
forest, and they came in sight of Mr. Cone's 
plantation. He had begun here as a poor 
man, but was year by year adding lands and 
servants to his estate. He still dwelt in a 
log-house, with the simplest furniture and 
conveniences, while his negroes were lodged in
<pb id="sally143" n="143"/>
ruder cabins around him. His family 
consisted of his wife and four sons. Mrs. Cone 
was a woman of great energy of character, 
but ignorant and narrow-minded. She had 
seen little of society, and her wardrobe at 
this time, was less valuable than Sally's, but 
she was ambitious of wealth and position, and 
envious of any one who surpassed her. She 
received the new-comers with a kind of coldness 
and severity, which made Sally feel that 
she would find in her the exacting mistress, 
rather than the sympathizing friend. Sally
had never been more utterly wretched than
when she lay down that night. A dreadful 
home-sickness, which she had not felt with 
the Lelands, weighed upon her heart. Spring 
was coming on. The leaf-buds were swelling, 
the woods were full of singing birds, and the 
winds were soft and balmy; but as she looked 
out in the moonlight upon the log-cabins, and 
the newly-cleared fields, and the broad forests 
beyond them, she sighed for the comely streets 
of Fayetteville, and was only oppressed by 
the untamed loveliness of Alabama.</p>
          <p>She had been purchased for a seamstress, 
and the next morning early her mistress 
brought her a shirt to make; but she had
<pb id="sally144" n="144"/>
had so much physical and mental suffering 
since her old sewing days in Carolina, that 
she had quite lost her former skill. Fearful 
of reproof, she tried to fit the pieces together, 
but her hands trembled, and she was so weak 
and bewildered that she gave up in despair. 
Her mistress was watching her, and after a 
few minutes she saw her go to the door and 
beckon to her husband, who was standing without.</p>
          <p>“Just come in here, Mr. Cone,” said she, 
“Leland has cheated you. You bought Sally 
for a seamstress, and she can't even make 
a shirt.”</p>
          <p>“Oh! missus,” said Sally, “'pears like I'se 
forgot all I know. Dere wasn't no woman o' 
my color could make shirts, an' pantaloons, 
an' dresses, better dan I, but 'pears like I'se 
lost my senses.”</p>
          <p>“It's doubtful if you ever had any,” said 
Mrs. Cone, in an angry voice.</p>
          <p>“Come, come, wife,” said her husband, 
“perhaps Sally'll do better after a while. 
There's other work enough; the garden 
wants hoeing and weeding—let her come 
out doors.”</p>
          <p>The shirt was laid aside, and Sally, glad to
<pb id="sally145" n="145"/>
escape from her mistress' eye, followed her 
master to the garden. Mr. Cone was preparing 
to build a frame house, and stumps were 
to be torn up, and brushwood was to be 
cleared away, and the ground to be leveled
about the place. At all this Sally worked 
for the next three months, gradually gaining 
strength of body in the open air, but with the 
same sickness and despair at heart. Perhaps 
it was well for her that she had daily tasks 
to perform, so that her thoughts in working 
hours were necessarily occupied, but when 
night came, the memory of her griefs came 
with it. “Oh,” said she, “I allers cried 
myself to sleep in dem days, an' dreamed all 
night 'bout de ole home an' de chil'en.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Cone's cook was “Aunt Eve,” an old 
woman who had had quite a fame in the kitchen 
in her younger days, and in consequence 
had grown very vain and tenacious of her 
position. She was now getting old and 
incompetent. Her mistress was much dissatisfied, 
and hardly a meal passed without complaints 
on her part, and resolves to make a 
change. One day, when some articles of food 
came on to the table wholly spoiled, and Mrs. 
Cone was questioning, as usual, what she
<pb id="sally146" n="146"/>
should do, her husband said, “Why don't
you try Sally? she's used to cooking.”</p>
          <p>“I never thought of it. I've had no 
patience with her since she spoiled that shirt. 
She looks so solemn, and makes herself so 
smart in her calico dress Sundays, that I 
don't take to her much.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you 'd better try her. Eve's rules 
are good enough, and she can show her how.”</p>
          <p>So Sally was placed in the kitchen to do the 
cooking according to Eve's directions. The 
old woman regarded it as an infringement 
upon her rights, and revenged herself by 
treating Sally in the most capricious and 
provoking manner, Sometimes she would refuse
to tell her what she asked—sometimes
she would give her wrong measures, and so it 
came to pass that Sally's cooking was even 
less satisfactory  than Eve's. “Dis made missis 
angry,” said Sally, “an' she'd come in de kitch'en 
an' scold me, an' crack me over de head, 
an' den Eve would be glad, an' wouldn't tell 
me nothin', an' 'peared like I did worse all de 
time. Oh, how I cried every night, an' wished 
I could die 'fore de next mornin.' I thought 
then sure de Lord had cast me off. I didn't 
take no pains to look nice, like I used to, nor
<pb id="sally147" n="147"/>
to have my room neat. I didn't care for 
nothin.' One night when I sot a crying, Eliza
Freeman—she married masr's nephew—she  
come to my cabin, an' says she, “Sally, I'm 
going to give you some pieces of calico to 
make you a bedspread, and I advise you to 
rouse yourself up, and try to be cheerful. <hi rend="italics">Lay 
down North Carolina awl take up Alabama;</hi> if 
you don't you'll have a poor miserable time 
of it, anyway.” Well arter she went out, I 
pondered on it, an' I thought p'raps I was to
blame to grieve so, and p'raps de Lord hadn't
forsook me, more'n I'd forsook de Lord an' I
made up my mind, with His help, to try an' 
bar de cross, in' begin new from dat hour to 
serve Him. So I got up an' made de bed, and 
clar'd up de room, an' den I knelt down an' 
prayed to de Lord to be with me, an' never 
leave me any more. An' 'peared like He
heard me, an' come down an' stood by me, an'
said ‘Sally, I will.’ An' den I felt happy for
de first time since I left my ole home.</p>
          <p>“The next mornin' missis sent for me, an' 
says she, ‘Sally, how is it you don't make 
things to suit me any better?’ An' says I, ‘I 
dunno, missis. I tries hard enough to do jes' 
like Eve tells me.’</p>
          <pb id="sally148" n="148"/>
          <p>“‘Well, how did you use to do in Carolina?’</p>
          <p>“‘Why, I had my own measures, an' followed 
my own ways.’</p>
          <p>“‘Well,’ says she, ‘I want you to let Eve 
alone, and follow your own ways now.’</p>
          <p>“I thought this was a great privilege, for 
de ole lady was mighty contrary. De next 
mornin' while I was gettin' de breakfast, Aunt
Eve come in, an' begun to order me about, an'
says I, ‘Missis said I was to lay down your 
rules, an' pick up mine.’ Then she was mad, 
an' went and told missis I'd sarsed her, and 
missis called me, an' says she, ‘Sally, what 
did you say to Aunt Eve?’ An' says I, ‘Missis, 
I told her you said I was to lay down her 
rules, an' pick up mine.’ ‘Well,’ says she, ‘I 
just called you so Eve might know you are 
not to follow her ways any longer.’ So I got 
breakfast, an' it suited, an' den I got dinner, 
an' dat suited, and when mas'r come home, 
missis told him Sally had took new rules, and 
now she thought she could please her. So 
things went on pretty well.”</p>

          <p>OLD Aunt Eve was full of vexation to see 
Sally promoted and herself set aside as useless, 
where once she had been supreme. All 
her life had been spent on an isolated plantation; 
she had had no religious influences to 
soften her heart; the only instruction she 
had ever received had been in relation to her 
cooking, and her naturally violent temper had 
grown harsher and sourer with advancing 
age. She envied and hated her new rival,
<pb id="sally150" n="150"/>
and longed for an opportunity of revenge. 
She had hardly clothes enough to make herself 
decent, and Sally, in kindness, gave her 
several articles from her own store. She had 
heard the story of Sally's checked apron, her 
mother's parting gift, and one day, seeing it 
drying upon the line, she secretly pulled it 
down, and not daring to wear it herself, 
secreted it, for a time, and then gave it away 
to one of her acquaintances. Sally was deeply 
grieved at its loss, but it was not till long 
afterward that she knew who had stolen it.</p>
          <p>In the neighborhood where the Cones lived, 
religious services were hold only once a month, 
and then in a small church, about four miles 
from the plantation. On one of these fortunate 
Sabbaths, when Sally had lived about a 
year with her new master, her mistress called 
her to her room and told her she was going 
to church, and expected to bring some friends 
home to dinner with her; and wished her, 
therefore, to prepare every thing in the best
possible manner. Pleased with her mistress' 
apparent confidence in her ability, Sally went 
to the kitchen, and having put all her cooking 
arrangements in the right train, she 
returned to the house, the new one which
<pb id="sally151" n="151"/>
had been recently completed, and, going into
the dining-room, began to set the table as she
had seen it done in North Carolina. Mrs.
Cone was very desirous to attain to that style
of living which characterized the best families
in the vicinity. When she moved into 
her house she had purchased many new 
articles of furniture—among them a complete
dinner-set of blue ware. This was the first 
day it had been used, and Sally, who had 
a natural taste and skill for such things, 
arranged it all to the best advantage. As 
she was putting the finishing touches to the 
table, Aunt Eve, who had been watching her 
from behind the door, thrust her head into 
the room, and with a malignant scowl, 
exclaimed, “Laws, now! s'pose you think dat's 
mighty nice. S'pose you think we never seed 
nithin' afore. Folks knows as much here as 
dey does in Car'lina, any day.”</p>
          <p>“I was only tryin' to please missis,” said 
Sally, as Eve went out, slamming the door 
behind her.</p>
          <p>And “missis” was pleased. Her guests 
<sic corr="complemented">complimented</sic> the dinner, and for the first 
time she spoke approvingly to Sally. Eve 
was listening in the hall, and her mistress'
<pb id="sally152" n="152"/>
words of praise rankled in her heart. How 
should she revenge herself? She thought a 
moment, and then stealing slily up stairs to 
Mrs. Cone's room, she took a piece of chintz 
calico which was lying there, and pushing it
far out of sight behind the bureau, crept softly 
down again, and looked to see if she could 
find her mistress alone but she had gone 
back to her company and was occupied with 
them until late in the evening. Eve did not 
abandon her cruel purpose, however, but early
Monday morning she went to her mistress, 
and told her that the day before, while she 
was away at church, she saw Sally go to her 
room and take the chintz calico and carry it
off with her.  Mrs. Cone was angry in a moment. 
All her old prejudices against Sally 
revived. Without considering that Eve might 
have told an untruth, she ascertained that the 
calico had really disappeared, and then, in a 
violent passion, despatched a messenger for 
Sally and for her husband. Mr. Cone was as 
much enraged as his wife, when he heard what 
had happened, and, in spite of Sally's 
protestations of innocence, he took her into an 
old out-building, and tying her to a horse-block,
<pb id="sally153" n="153"/>
told her he should whip her till she 
confessed where she had hid it.</p>
          <p>“Den,” said Sally, “if he gin me five lashes, 
he gin me five hundred, till I told him if he'd
<figure id="ill1" entity="sally153"><p>[Illustration]</p></figure>
stop whippin' me, I'd get de calico, though I
didn't know for de life o' me whar't was.
So I ran over to his mother's she lived in a
little house near by, an' asked her what I
should do. Sez she, Sally, I dunno what in
<pb id="sally154" n="154"/>
the world's the matter with him. I believe 
Polly (dat was de name of mas'r's wife) has 
hid it herself’ But I knew I darsn't say no 
sich thing, so I run for de swamp. Dey
missed me, and started out wid de dogs, but
dey went up de road an' I went down, an' so
dey didn't see me.”</p>
          <p>Poor soul! Just as she had begun to hope 
for more peaceful days, this new affliction 
came upon her. But she had resolved, come 
what would, that she would never doubt or 
distrust her God again, and now, as she 
plunged into the darkest recesses of the
swamp, with her back all bleeding from its
wounds, she poured out her whole soul to
Him in earnest prayer for comfort and
direction. </p>
          <p>It was yet early morning. The trees were 
dripping like rain with dews of the night. 
The magnolia, the dogwood, and the wild 
jessamine, the honeysuckle, and a thousand
other flowers, made the air heavy with 
fragrance; and strange-looking poisonous vines,
with brilliant orange flowers, clambered from 
tree to tree, and almost wove the branches
together. Sally sought the most secluded
spot, and, sitting, down, leaned for support
<pb id="sally155" n="155"/>
against the trunk of a tree, In the distance
she heard the deep baying of the dogs and 
the occasional call of her pursuers, but as 
they were going in an opposite direction, the 
sounds at length died away, and only the 
songs of birds and the rustle of leaves awoke 
the silence. She was in such an agony of 
pain that she could not think clearly, and so 
she lay in a kind of stupor, while the hot 
hours of noon went by. The dimness of 
twilight was setting upon the swamp when 
she roused herself and began to reflect upon 
her condition. She could not hope to remain 
long concealed, and even if she could, she had 
no means of sustaining life; she was 
conscious of her innocence, and she had faith 
that God would protect her, and so she 
resolved to find her way back to her master, 
But she was quite bewildered. She knew not 
which way to take to reach the open country. 
Just then she heard the tinkling of a bell, and 
looking up, she saw a horse a little distance 
from her. The bell was suspended from his 
neck, and he had evidently strayed away 
from pasture. The thought struck her that 
by following him she might find her way to 
the road and so she commenced driving him,
<pb id="sally156" n="156"/>
but taking care to let him go in the direction
he chose. A little distance, and the firm 
ground was gained, and then a path which 
led to the highway. She was so stiff and 
sore from her wounds that it was with 
difficulty  she could move, and when she came to 
a little brook, she stooped down and bathed 
her back in the cool water, and wetting her 
handkerchief that she wore, pinned it again 
over her shoulders. The day had been 
intensely warm, and now the thunder began to 
mutter in the sky, and the big drops of rain 
began to fall, and soon there was a drenching 
shower. But the horse went on and Sally 
followed, till at length they came to a small
house on the road side. Hearing the bell, 
the occupant, a white man, came out and 
secured the horse, and seeing Sally, asked her 
where she came from. She dared not tell 
him the truth, and so said that mas'r Cone 
had sent for her to come and do some sewing 
at his house, but that in trying to go there 
she had lost her way. “Why,” said the man, 
“you're ten miles out of your course, but 
you can stay in the barn here to-night, and 
to-morrow morning I'll put you in the right 
road.” So she went into the barn, thankful
<pb id="sally157" n="157"/>
for any shelter, but her back was so bruised 
and mangled that she could not lie down. All 
that weary night she sat up, tormented by 
pain, and waiting with fearful anticipation 
until the dawn of day.</p>
          <p>True to his word, in the morning the man 
called her, and, taking her into an open 
wagon, drove for several miles in an easterly 
direction, and then, stopping whore two roads 
met, he helped her to dismount, saying, “This 
is Mr. Johnson's plantation, and the next is 
Mr. Cones's. Follow your right-hand road, 
and three miles will take you there.” Sally 
thanked him from her heart, and he rode away.</p>
          <p>Among the slaves on Mr. Johnson's plantation, 
was an old man called “Uncle Joe,” who 
was famous with the negroes for his kindness 
and tact when any one of them was in 
trouble. Sally had often heard of him, and 
to his cabin, which stood a little apart from 
the rest, she now directed her steps. He was 
at home, for on account of his age he was 
excused from much active labor. Sally told 
him her story without reserve, and asked 
him what she had best do. He gave her 
some food, of which she was greatly in need,
<pb id="sally158" n="158"/>
and advised her to remain in his cabin for 
the day, and at night to make her way 
toward home. His wife dressed her wounds,
and did all that sympathy could do to inspire 
her with courage. They were godly people—
this aged slave couple; they had seen much
of sorrow, but through the Lord they had 
triumphed over all. Sally took sweet counsel 
with them of the things of heaven, and before
they parted they prayed together, and then 
sung one of those hymns, full of repetition, 
so meaningless when written, but so eloquent
to the sensitive negro heart when sung:
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><lg type="stanza"><l>“Oh, when I'm in trouble here,</l><l>Lord, when I'm in trouble here,</l><l>Give me Jesus! Give me Jesus!</l><l>You who will may have dis world—</l><l>Give me Jesus!</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Oh, when I've an hour of peace,</l><l>Lord, when I've an hour of peace,</l><l>Give me Jesus! Give me Jesus!</l><l>He's the only friend I want,</l><l>Give me Jesus!</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“Oh, when I'm a-going to die,</l><l>Lord, when I'm a-going to die,</l><l>Give me Jesus! Give me Jesus!</l><l>Over Jordan glad to go,</l><l>Give me Jesus!”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <pb id="sally159" n="159"/>
          <p>Sally bid her kind friends farewell at
evening, but as she walked along, she could
not make up her mind to go directly home.
The church was about half a mile away, and
to it she bent her steps. When she reached
it it was dark and silent, but darkness and
silence had no terrors for her, and she went
in and sat down to rest herself, and to try to
sleep, feeling that for the time she was secure
from danger. The night passed, and the 
morning came.  She half resolved to go boldly
home, and then her fear overcame her 
resolution, and so, fluctuating between 
determinations and misgivings, the day wore away.
About noon, some wagoners encamped near
the church, and, waking a fire, cooked their
dinner there. Faint with hunger, Sally
watched them, and after nightfall, she stole
out to see if they had left any remnants of
their meal. In the ashes she found several
half roasted potatoes, which she eagerly ate,
and, feeling strengthened, she decided, with
the first morning light, to go straight to her
master.</p>
          <p>With the earliest ray in the east she
commenced her walk, and the still had not yet 
risen when she come in sight of the dwelling.
<pb id="sally160" n="160"/>
Concealing herself behind a tree in the yard,
till some friendly servant should appear, by 
whom she could send word to her master, of 
her arrival, she prayed God to help her, and 
to “prepare the way” before her. In a few 
minutes, she saw Martin, the waiter, going 
toward the house with some kindling wood in 
his hands. He was a good-natured fellow, 
and she at once came forward and spoke to 
him. How thankful was she when he told 
her their mistress had found the calico behind 
the bureau the day after she ran away!</p>
          <p>Her fear was gone and she stopped boldly 
into the house with Martin, who went to his 
master's door and told him Sally had come. 
Mr. Cone came quickly out, and Sally, brave 
in her innocence, stood there, erect as she 
might with her wounded shoulders, to receive 
him. All trace of anger had gone from his 
face; he was even embarrassed as he 
advanced to meet her.</p>
          <p>“I am glad to see you again, Sally. Where 
have you been all this time?”</p>
          <p>Sally was afraid to say she had received 
any assistance from a slave, because she knew 
they would be severely punished if their
<pb id="sally161" n="161"/>
kindness was known, so, praying God to 
forgive the falsehood, she replied,</p>
          <p>“I stayed in de church, mas'r, an' some 
wagoners give me something to eat.”</p>
          <p>Just then Mrs. Cone came into the room. 
She knew the fault had been hers in accusing 
Sally so hastily, but she was too proud and 
willful to acknowledge it, and so did not speak.</p>
          <p>“Wife,” said Mr. Cone, “I'm mighty sorry 
for this, and I tell you I'll sell Sally before 
I'll ever whip her again.”</p>
          <p>So she was dismissed to her cabin without 
a word.</p>

          <p>For three weeks Sally was unable to lie 
down in bed, on account of the severe blows 
she had received at her whipping, and she 
was excused by her mistress from cooking, 
but at the end of that time she was thought 
well enough to resume her usual duties. All 
the cooking for the house was to be done by 
her, and, in addition to this, she had her daily 
task of sewing on the shirts and trowsers for 
the slaves. This she often had to do at night, 
by the light of the fire, when her day's house
<pb id="sally163" n="163"/>
work was over. Sally's was no well-ordered 
northern kitchen, stocked with conveniences.  
It was a small cabin of one apartment, in the 
rear of her master's house. At one end was 
the fireplace, but about as much smoke settled 
down in the room as went up the chimney.
She had very few cooking utensils, and was 
obliged to use the same kettle and the same
spoon for half a dozen different purposes. 
Hurrying from morning till night, broiling 
over the fire or busy at her needle, her weeks 
went by. To make her labor yet harder, she 
had to cut her own fuel and to carry it from 
the woods to the house, often doing it at night 
and to bring all the water she used from a
spring some distance away.</p>
          <p>Mr. Cone was prospering in the world, and
his wife spared no pains to improve in their
style of living. She began to require more
elaborately prepared meals, and poor Sally
was taxed to the utmost to accomplish all
which was expected of her. Every day, in
her little kitchen, she made delicious pies and
cakes for “the house,” but she was never allowed
to taste them—if she did, she was sure
to be whipped for it by her mistress. Mrs.
Cone was not above using the whip with her
<pb id="sally164" n="164"/>
hands when anything offended her, and 
as Sally had been legally made over to her at
the time of her purchase, she felt that she had 
a peculiar right to control her as she pleased. 
Sometimes she would make the women whip 
each other, but they soon learned to make
seemingly heavy blows very light. Sally had 
always had tea and coffee and sugar in 
Fayetteville, and now it was very hard for her to 
be deprived of them when her labor was so 
severe. Sometimes, when the breakfast was unusually 
nice, her mistress would send her a cup 
of coffee, but this was not often; and so she sat
up at night to knit and to do little odd jobs of 
sewing, that she might earn money enough to 
purchase these luxuries for herself. Mrs. Cone
had had for years a habit of occasionally drinking 
brandy. As she grew older, her desire 
for it increased. Unknown to her husband, 
she kept it always in her closet, and although 
she never became intoxicated, she often drank 
so much as to be very irritable and unreasonable. 
When at length her husband discovered 
it, he was greatly grieved. He was a member 
of the church and of the temperance society, 
but he could not control his wife, for she would 
send slyly for brandy by the servants, who
<pb id="sally165" n="165"/>
dared not disobey missis' orders; and so, 
when he saw that she was under its influence, 
he would shut himself up in his room, and 
sometimes ride over to his plantation and stay 
for days together. So Sally was left to the 
entire control of a woman always cold-hearted 
and exacting, and at times tyrannical and 
cruel. Shut out from sympathy and friends, 
with nothing before her but thankless, 
monotonous  toil, to what did she turn for 
comfort?—for the heart lives by loving, and must
find rest somewhere. It was to God that she
looked. One by one her earthly supports had
been taken away, and she had learned to live
by faith in the Invisible. Day by day, in her
simple way, she was living out the truth of
those texts which higher and more cultivated
natures find it so difficult to receive and to
practice, “Pray without ceasing,” and
“Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.”</p>
          <p>“Every mornin',” said she, “I asked de 
Lord to go with me through de day—to help 
me make de pies an' cakes, an' to show me 
how to please missis, an' den I felt contented, 
whether I was whipped or not.”</p>
          <p>Had Sally forgotten the past, that she was 
thus quiet in the present? Oh, no! She
<pb id="sally166" n="166"/>
never laid her weary head upon her pillow 
without thinking of her mother, and her 
husband, and her children, and praying God to 
bless them wherever they were, and to unite 
them to her in the “New Jerusalem.” In 
this world she never thought again to see them.</p>
          <p>Sally grieved most for the pleasant Fayetteville 
Sundays, when, with her family about 
her, she had gone to church and heard the 
Bible read, and the singing, and the sermon.
Sunday on an Alabama plantation was a very 
different thing. All the servants who worked 
at a distance came home on that day to see 
their wives and families. Tired out with the 
labor of the week, it was, notwithstanding,
the only time they had in which to do any 
thing for themselves. They were required to 
keep their clothes clean, and this was the only 
day on which they could wash them. Then 
those who had a patch of ground given them 
to cultivate, wanted this time to work upon it. 
Some took the opportunity to go fishing, keeping 
part of the fish they caught as a treat for 
themselves, and selling the rest to their 
mistress to obtain a little money for buying flour 
or molasses. But most of them were too tired
<pb id="sally167" n="167"/>
to work, and would throw themselves down 
anywhere upon the ground, and sleep through 
the day like so many dogs, Bred to nothing 
but physical exercise—having only their 
animal nature cultivated, and constantly 
over-tasked, what else could be expected? When 
they finished their work early enough on 
Saturday evenings, they sometimes had a 
prayer-meeting in a grove at a little distance 
from the house. Sally could not attend this, 
nor the meeting on Sunday morning, “But 
gen'ally,” said she, “I could get about  
half an hour to go down to de afternoon meetin', 
when de folks was at dinner. We didn't 
have any preacher dere who knew how to 
read, our deacon couldn't read a word, but 
'peared like he allers know what to say. I 
know he talked right well, for I used to notice 
when I went to de church, an' 'peared like he 
talked just as de minister did. Den, after he'd 
exhorted, I'd have to go away, so they'd sing 
some far'well hymns, and den I'd go back to 
de house. Dis yer was one of de hymns I 
loved to sing:
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><lg type="stanza"><l>“‘I'll have a place in Paradise</l><l>To praise the Lord in glory;</l><pb id="sally168" n="168"/><l>O, sister! will you meet me there</l><l>To praise the Lord in glory?</l><l>By the grace of God I'll meet you there,</l><l>To praise the Lord in glory.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>“‘The blessed hour, it soon will come,</l><l>To praise the Lord in glory;</l><l>Oh, brother! will you meet me there</l><l>To praise the Lord in glory?</l><l>By the grace of God I'll meet you there </l><l>To praise the Lord in glory.’”</l></lg></lg></q></p>
          <p>Sally had joined the Baptist church soon 
after she was purchased by Mr. Cone, but she 
was never allowed to attend the services 
except on Sacrament Sundays, when her master 
insisted that this privilege should be granted 
her. The church was several miles away, 
and she had to make such haste in going and 
coming, on account of the dinner, that these 
were to her the most tiresome days of the year.</p>
          <p>Sabbath afternoon was the favorite time for 
training dogs to hunt negroes. When not in 
use, the dogs were always kept chained, and 
no colored person was allowed to speak to
them, or to feed them, under the penalty of 
a severe whipping. At training times, the 
dogs were let loose, and put on the track of a
<pb id="sally169" n="169"/>
little negro boy, who was made to climb a 
tree. When they could trace him unerringly 
to his place of concealment, they were 
considered trained.</p>
          <p>Such sights as this greeted Sally on the 
Sabbath. Every evening in the week there 
were family prayers at the house, which were 
free to all the servants. Sally longed to listen 
to the Bible, and she always went, excepting 
when her mistress had treated her so harshly 
that she thought to hear her read would do 
her more harm than good. Thus, with very 
little change, year after year passed away. 
Mr. Cone's sons were growing up about him, 
one of them, Stanley, into an idle, dissolute 
young man. Sally had heard nothing from
her children, but she continued to show to
Charlotte Rives, now married to the coachman,
the kindness and care of a mother.</p>
          <p>“I had heaps 'o trouble, den,” said Sally, “I 
didn't 'spect to got rid of it; I didn't look 
forward to nothin; but <hi rend="italics">I jes picked up de cross 
an' put it in my bosom</hi>, for de sake of de dear 
Lord who carried it for me so long ago!”</p>

          <p>SALLY had now lived twenty years with 
the Cones. She had been so accustomed to 
her life there, that her earlier days seemed to 
her vague and shadowy as a dream. In all 
this time, she had heard nothing from her
mother or her children; she only knew that		I
her husband, Lewis Beggs, was dead. She
thought of them, she prayed for them, but it
was almost as for those long since passed out
of life. It was rare in that region for a slave
to escape in any way from bondage. She
<pb id="sally171" n="171"/>
never looked forward to this. Death was to 
her the gate of freedom and the beginning 
of joy.</p>
          <p>During all those years she had been but 
two or three times absent from the plantation, 
and then by special permission. Her mistress 
had often been solicited by visitors at 
the house, to let her go and teach their servants 
her ways of cooking and arranging 
tables, but she always refused upon some 
pretext or other. About this time there was 
to be a merry-making at a wedding among 
the slaves on an adjoining plantation, and 
Sally was invited to be present. Her mistress 
chanced to be in a pleasant mood, and
so gave her leave to go. Delighted with the 
thought of a holiday, Sally made haste to
finish her work, and a little before dark on
the evening of the appointed day, arrayed in
a clean gown and turban, and with her “pass”
in her hand, she set out with the other
servants on her way to “Mas'r Blake's.” When
they reached there they found quite a
company assembled, the younger people dancing
to the music of a violin. Sally was glad to
see all her acquaintances, but she had no
heart for such merriment, so she retired to
<pb id="sally172" n="172"/>		
the farther corner of the room. She soon
noticed, sitting apart from the rest, a forlorn
looking man, in torn, rough clothes, to whom
no one seemed to pay any attention. Her
kind heart was moved with compassion, and
she took up her chair and sat down beside
him, and began to talk to him.</p>
          <p>“Good evenin'! 'Pears like you're a stranger 
here. Whar d'ye come from?”</p>
          <p>“I come from de Car'lina rice fields.’</p>
          <p>“Laws now! Dat's whar I was raised.
Mebbe ye knows some o' my folks. Did ye
ever hear o' de Williamses?”</p>
          <p>“Why, sartain I did. Dere's one o' 'em,
Mary Ann Williams, dat lives in Mobile. I
knows her right well.”</p>
          <p>“Laws! Ye don't say! Why she's my
own cousin, but I haint seen her dis thirty
year. What she doin' dere, an' how come
you to know her?”</p>
          <p>“Wal, ye see she's got a good master, an' she
hires her time an' takes in sewing an' makes
well on't. I goes on de river, an' I heern tell
of her, how she come from de rice-fields, an'
nat'ally when I goes to Mobile, I goes to see
her, an' we talks 'bout de ole places.”</p>
          <pb id="sally173" n="173"/>
          <p>“To be sure! to be sure! When'll ye be 
gwine back?”</p>
          <p>“I 'specs de boat'll go to-morrow mornin'. 
We run smash 'gin anoder boat dis arternoon, 
an' we's jes' waitin' till dey can 'pair her. 
Dat's de way I come to be here.”</p>
          <p>“Would ye take a little bundle for me to 
Mary Ann?”</p>
          <p>“Sartain I will, an' I'll go 'long wid ye now 
an' get it.”</p>
          <p>The interest of the party was all over to 
Sally, so getting up quietly she went out.</p>
          <p>Among Mr. Cone's servants was a boy about
fifteen years of age, called Nero, who had
always manifested for Sally the affection of a
son. He was remarkably sprightly and
intelligent, and, secretly, getting one idea here, 
and another there, he had taught himself to 
read with a good degree of ease, and to write 
a tolerably fair hand. Sally's plan was to get 
him to write a letter for her, so she beckoned 
to him, and, taking him aside, told him what 
she wanted. He was delighted to do it for 
her, and the three were soon on their way to 
Mr. Cone's. Arrived at her cabin, Sally 
kindled a little blaze on the hearth, while Nero 
produced from his store a pen and ink, and a
<pb id="sally174" n="174"/>
small piece of paper, and wrote the letter to 
her dictation. It suddenly occurred to her 
that at Mary Ann might have forgotten her, or
would not feel sure that she had written the
letter. What proof could she give her?</p>
          <p>When her mother came to bid her good-by
at the time she left Fayetteville, she had given 
Sally a small plaid shawl, which their old mistress 
Williams, the deaf and dumb lady, was 
accustomed to throw over her shoulders when 
she first rose in the morning, and which she 
had presented to Sally's mother. It was a 
singular-looking shawl, and she knew Mary 
Ann would remember it, and that it would 
serve to establish the identity of both. So
she put it into a little parcel with the letter, 
and asked the boatman to give it to her
cousin, and to return the shawl again to her, 
which he promised to do.</p>
          <p>When he had gone, Sally lay down and tried 
to sleep, but a thousand thoughts were in her
mind. Hopes and desires which had slumbered 
for twenty years waked to life. Her
children, her friends, her early home, came
back in memory, and the old home-sickness
and longing filled her heart. She began to
wonder if she could not go to Mobile and see
<pb id="sally175" n="175"/>
her cousin with her own eyes, and resolved 
that she would speak to her mistress about it 
on the morrow, and so thinking, she fell asleep.</p>
          <p>When morning came, she thought it wisest 
to delay speaking to her mistress until she 
had actually heard from her cousin, and so 
she waited anxiously till the “Magnolia” 
should return, and the boatman bring her an 
answer to her letter: and every day she 
prayed that, if it was God's will, she might 
not be disappointed. Two weeks passed, during 
which she heard nothing, and she had 
almost given up hope; but one night, about 
nine o'clock, as she sat half asleep by the fire, 
she was roused by a tapping at her door, and,
opening it, there stood Daniel, the boatman,
with a bundle and a letter from Mary Ann.
Neither of them could read it, so Sally stole
softly out for Nero. He was as pleased as she
was to find that an answer had really been
received. It was in Mary Ann's own unpraticed
hand, and it was a long time before Nero
could decipher it. It was cordial letter,
expressing great joy that Sally was alive, and,
too wonderful for belief, telling her that her
son Isaac had some years before been in
Mobile with his master; that he had sought out
<pb id="sally176" n="176"/>
his cousin Mary Ann, and inquired earnestly 
of her for his mother; and that since then he 
had written her that he had purchased his 
freedom and was a Methodist minister at the 
North!</p>
          <p>Sally was quite overcome by this sudden 
and joyful news. Again and again she would 
have the letter read to her. She would hardly 
have believed its words had not the shawl 
been returned with it, with the message that 
she remembered the way their old mistress 
used to pin it on, and had not her cousin sent 
her also a new calico dress. It was like that 
older surprise when they told Jacob, saying,</p>
          <p>“Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor 
over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's 
heart fainted, for he believed them not. And 
they told him all the words of Joseph which 
he had said unto them; and when he saw the 
wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, 
the spirit of Jacob, their father, revived, and 
he said, ‘It is enough; Joseph, my son, is yet 
alive; I will go and see him before I die!’”</p>
          <p>When Daniel and Nero had left the cabin, 
and Sally was alone, she burst into tears of 
joy, and falling on her knees, thanked God for 
His great mercy, and consecrated herself anew
<pb id="sally177" n="177"/>
to Him. That her son was living, was happiness
enough—that he was a free man and a
minister, quite outran her conceptions of good.</p>
          <p>There was nothing objectionable in her 
cousin's letter, so the next morning she 
carried it to her mistress, and while she read it,
she said to her in a trembling tone,</p>
          <p>“Please missis, if you or Miss Eliza, traveled 
on de boat as de ladies do, an' would take me 
with you down to Mobile, I should so like to
see Mary Ann!”</p>
          <p>“No, Sally, I never travel.”</p>
          <p>“Well, 'pears like, if you 'd let me go some
time?”</p>
          <p>“No, Sally, you can just give up thinking 
any thing more about it—it's altogether too
far from home.”</p>
          <p>Sally took the letter, upon which no 
comment was made, and put it safely by; but
sleeping or waking, the thought of it was ever
present with her. “A few weeks after this,”
to use her own words, “I was a-getting 
supper, an' mas'r called me, an' I was scared, for
I didn't know what was de matter. I tried
to think if I had done anything, but thinks I,
‘you've got to go,’ for mas'r was one of de
men, if he told you he'd whip you, he would.
<pb id="sally178" n="178"/>
Well, I went in an' stood by his side, an' he 
had a paper in his hand, an' says he,</p>
          <p>“Sally, whar'd you live?”</p>
          <p>“Near Fayetteville, on Haymount Hill,” 
says I.</p>
          <p>“Who were your neighbors?”</p>
          <p>So I told him.</p>
          <p>“What was your husband's name, and what 
was he sold for?”</p>
          <p>So I told him that, an' then says he,</p>
          <p>“Sally, here's a letter from your son Isaac, sure!”</p>
          <p>Well, I could hardly believe it; but says he,</p>
          <p>“Sally, he wants to buy you. Now you've paid 
for yourself many times over, and if you 
can get your mistress to give you up, you 
know you belong to her, I'm willing.”</p>
          <p>So I went right and spoke to mistress about 
it, an' says she, </p>
          <p>“Sally, it's not my mind any way,” an' 
then she'd have nothing more said about it, 
only she was dreadful cross to me. Isaac 
kept writin' to mas'r an' wanted me to tell 
him 'bout things dat happened when he was 
a boy, an' when I did, he wrote back dat he 
know'd 't was his mother. Missis whipped
me more'n ever cause she thought I'd feel
<pb id="sally179" n="179"/>
kinder independent 'bout Isaac's wantin' to 
buy me. I was allers thinkin' 'bout it, but I 
didn't dare let missis know, an' when she 
spoke 'bout Isaac, I'd say,</p>
          <p>“Poor follow! he wants to see his mother, 
but I guess he never will.”</p>
          <p>Mas'r was all de time tryin' to coax missis 
to give me up. One day we had company to 
dinner, an' missis was very happy with her 
chil'n round her, an' mas'r asked her 'fore all 
de gentlemen, if she didn't pity Sally when 
she wanted to see her son. I knew she'd be 
mad, so I got out of the room as quick as I 
could, I was waitin' on de table, and prayed 
de Lord to soften her heart. Sometimes I 
gin up altogether. It was a consolation to 
me to think about de grave, an' I thought if
my son didn't get me, I'd be there to rise
with 'em in the mornin'.</p>

          <p>A YEAR, full of suspense and anxiety to
Sally, passed away. Isaac wrote frequent
letters to the Cones, begging them to name
the price at which they would sell his mother. 
Mr. Cone would gladly have parted with her, 
but  her mistress, to whom she belonged, was
unwilling to lose so valuable a servant. Ever 
since she came there, Sally had lived in the 
little smoky kitchen, but now, in order to 
make her situation as pleasant as possible,
her master built for her, in the yard, a small
frame house with a brick chimney, and placed
in its one large room several convenient 
articles of furniture. She had still all 
the family
<pb id="sally181" n="181"/>
cooking to do, but she had better facilities for
her work, and a good bed to sleep upon when
it was over. She dared not speak to her
mistress about her freedom, lest it should
make her more determined not to release her.
She felt that prayer was her only resource,
and through the busy day and the quiet night,
thoughts went up to God in yearning
supplication that He would soften her mistress' 
heart. As Mrs. Cone had grown older, she 
had become somewhat milder in character. 
She had been for years a member of the 
church;  and now, when Isaac's letters came, 
entreating her to sell his mother, she began 
to feel that perhaps it was her christian duty 
to consent. So she finally said her husband 
might write, to him that she would part with 
Sally for four hundred dollars. She did not 
believe he could ever raise so large a sum, 
but she had quieted her conscience by naming 
a price.</p>
          <p>Isaac was now the pastor of a struggling 
church in Detroit, with a family dependent 
upon his exertions for their daily bread. It 
was long before he was able to do much 
toward collecting the money, but in this 
interval he wrote many letters of affectionate
<pb id="sally182" n="182"/>
cheer to his mother. Sally never despaired.
She had taken up her cross and carried it 
whithersoever her Lord had led her, and now 
she had faith to believe He would grant her 
this joyful crown.</p>
          <p>At length, Isaac raised the whole sum, and 
transmitted it, as had been narrated, to her 
master.</p>
          <p>“ 'Fore de money come,” said Sally, “I 
never said nothin' 'bout it, I was as still as 
a dumb creetur, but when I knew mas'r had 
really got it, den I felt independent.”</p>
          <p>In the evening of the day upon which it 
was received, Sally was summoned to her 
mistress' room. “Hope deferred maketh the 
heart sick.” She had become so nervous from 
the delay, that the least thing agitated her. 
Trembling she went in, and sat down in a 
chair which her master gave her.</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally,” said he, “you're your own 
mistress now. There 's a letter from Isaac, 
with a check for four hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, mas'r! de Lord be praised!”</p>
          <p>“Why, Sally,” broke in Mrs. Cone, “are 
you so glad to leave your old home?”</p>
          <p>“Oh! missis, I's sorry to leave yon an' 
mas'r—you's been good to me, an' 'pears
<pb id="sally183" n="183"/>
like I shall feel kind o' strange anywheres
else; but den, I's goin' to see one o' my
chil'en! To think what de Lord has brought
me to! I thought I should carry de cress
clar down to de river, an' now He's given
me de crown 'fore I gets to Jordan!”</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally,” said Mr. Cone, “I did n't 
think 't would come to this; but I'm glad 
for your sake. Isaac must be a fine fellow. 
You're to go on the boat next week, in charge 
of a gentleman, all the way to New York, 
and there you'll meet your son. He has sent 
you five dollars to buy a dress, or anything 
you may need for the journey; and he handed 
her the money.</p>
          <p>Five dollars! Sally hadn't had half as 
much money in her possession since her old 
cake-selling days in Fayetteville.</p>
          <p>“Laws now, de dear boy,” she exclaimed, 
(he was still to her the boy whom she had 
left twenty-five years before,) I 'spects he 
needs it himself; an' him sendin' all dis 
money to buy me, I shall take it to get 
something for him an' de chil'en;” and bidding 
her master and mistress good night, she went 
to her house.</p>
          <p>The news of her freedom was already noised
<pb id="sally184" n="184"/>
abroad among the slaves, and she found quite 
a company awaiting her arrival. Twenty-five 
kind and blameless years had won for her the 
respect and affection of all her fellow-servants, 
and as she entered, they crowded around her; 
and in their simple way, some with tears and 
ejaculations, and some with jokes and laughter, 
they congratulated her upon her good fortune.</p>
          <p>“Oh, my friends,” said Sally, “dis is more 
dan I ever 'pected. I hope de Lord'll make
me humble. I thought I should live and die
with ye; but 'pears like dere's something else
for me to do. I mus' go whar de Master calls,
but I shall never forget ye—never. We'll
have a good meetin' together 'fore I goes
away but now ye mus' leave me alone with
de Lord.”</p>
          <p>Quietly they went out, and Sally's 
over-charged heart poured itself forth in 
thanksgiving to Him who had led her through such
a wondrous gate of joy. All the bitter 
sorrows of sixty years faded away, and her 
grateful thoughts dwelt only upon her 
unexpected mercies. She forgot the unkind 
treatment of her mistress, and the trials from the 
servants when she first came to live with the
<pb id="sally185" n="185"/>
Cones; she loved them all, and remembered 
them in her prayers.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Cone was much affected by the humility 
with which Sally received the news of her 
freedom. She was sorry to part with one 
whose services were so valuable to her, for 
Sally, though sixty years old, was still strong
and active; and, more than this, she began to
be troubled at the thought that she had not 
done her christian duty by her. These feelings 
disposed her to be very lenient now, so
she allowed her to call on the neighboring 
ladies to bid them good-by, and to sell her bed 
to one of them, (the featherbed she had 
brought from Fayetteville,) and to keep the 
money for her own use. Sally was a favorite 
with the neighbors, and they gave her various 
articles of clothing as parting presents. She 
obtained permission also to send to town, and 
there, forgetful of self, she expended her five 
dollars in purchasing a stout pair of shoes for 
Isaac, and various gifts for his children.</p>
          <p>It was the night before she was to leave 
Alabama. Her “free papers” were in her 
possession, her worldly goods were all packed 
in an old trunk her mistress had given her, 
and she sat in the center of her kitchen,
<pb id="sally186" n="186"/>
surrounded by Mr. Cone's servants and a few 
from a neighboring plantation, who had come 
to bid her farewell. They were all sorry to 
part with her, and longed to know more of 
that freedom to which she was going. For a 
moment a gloom seemed to overspread the 
circle, when one old woman exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally, arter all, de Lord's jes' as near 
to us here as He'll be to you dere.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes!” said Sally, “dat's de greates' 
comfort; we never can lose de Lord. If we 
love Him, He'll allers stay by.”</p>
          <p>Then she spoke to each one separately, and 
shook them by the hand, and exhorted them 
to meet her in heaven. It was with sobs and 
tears that they sang this favorite farewell 
hymn:</p>
          <lg type="song">

          <p>Silently they went out, and Sally was left
alone. As they crossed the yard, Nero 
suddenly came up to one of the women and said, 
in a hurried whisper,</p>
          <p>“Oh, Aunt Sue! has Sally gone?”</p>
          <p>“No, Nero! but she's a gwine to-morrow 
mornin'. We's jes' been biddin' her good-by.”</p>
          <p>“Dat's  good; I was afeard I shouldn't see 
her agin. I stole away from de plantation, 
cause I know'd dey wouldn't let me come if 
I asked em.”</p>
          <pb id="sally188" n="188"/>
          <p>“Well, Nero! I knows she'll be glad to see 
ye. De Lord knows we's all sorry 'nuff to 
have her go, but we couldn't 'spect her to 
stay when her son's paid de money for her. 
Oh, dear! dere was my Sam dat dey whipped 
to death 'cause he would try to run away. If 
he'd a lived, he'd a been jes' like Isaac. Oh 
dear, dear!”—and the poor creature went to 
her cabin, and Nero tapped softly at Sally's door.</p>
          <p>“Bless de Lord! Nero,” said she, as she 
opened it, “I thought I should go away 
without seein' ye.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Sally! 'pears like I can't have ye go 
noways. Dey sold me away from my mother, 
an' now dere's nobody dat cares for me but 
you.”</p>
          <p>“Don't take on so, Nero. I's sorry to 
leave ye; but de Lord 's in Alabama jes' as 
much as whar I'm agoin'. You's been very 
good to me, an' I never shall forget ye.”</p>
          <p>“Sally, I don't want to live here, I want to 
be <hi rend="italics">free</hi>. When I think about it, 'pears like I 
can't stay here another day. Sometimes I 
almost conclude to run away, but dere ain't 
much chance for dat.”</p>
          <pb id="sally189" n="189"/>
          <p>“Oh, Nero, ye mus'n't talk so. P'r'aps de 
Lord'll prepar de way one o' dese days.”</p>
          <p>“Why Sally, He's let you live here sixty years.”</p>
          <p>“Well, chile, I 's tried to bar de cross, an' 
now He's givin' me de crown, de crown o' 
joy. Dat's what we mus' all do, an' den, if 
he sees best, He'll give us de reward, even in 
dis world; but if He do n't, <hi rend="italics">we's sure of it in 
de kingdom.</hi></p>
          <p>“I'll remember ye, an' when I gets to New 
York, I'll tell de people 'bout ye, and mebbe 
dey'll some on 'em buy ye. Keep up a good 
heart, an' the Lord be with ye!”</p>
          <p>It was late, and afraid to stay longer, the 
poor boy tore himself away. <ref id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2" targOrder="U">*</ref><note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2"><p>* The boy, Nero, now nearly twenty years of age, is still 
living on the Alabama plantation, and doubtless yearning 
for freedom. According to Sally's account of him, 
he must possess unusual ability and excellence of character.</p></note></p>
          <p>The night passed and the morning came. 
Sally was up with the sun, and assisted for 
the last time in preparing the family breakfast. 
When it was over, her mistress came 
into her house with a shawl over her shoulders,
<pb id="sally190" n="190"/>
and, accosting her very pleasantly, asked 
her to go out and take a walk with her.</p>
          <p>“Yes, missis,” said Sally, and together they 
went out, her mistress leading the way, till 
they came to the fowl-yard, where she sat 
down upon a fallen board, and motioned Sally 
to sit beside her.</p>
          <p>Sally's meek and consistent course had had 
a deep effect upon Mrs. Cone. She was softened 
and humbled by it, and now that she was 
about to leave her, she desired to make all the 
reparation in her power for the long years of 
indifference and severity.</p>
          <p>“Sally,” said she, “I want you to pray with 
me before you go away, and I want to pray 
with you. We shall never see each other again.”</p>
          <p>“No, missis,” said Sally, “not in dis world, 
but I shall allers pray for you an' mas'r an' 
all de chil'en.”</p>
          <p>“Sally, if I've ever done wrong by you, I 
hope you'll forgive me.”</p>
          <p>Sally was wholly overcome by these words 
of her mistress. She forgot all she had 
suffered. Her heart was full of love, and the 
tears ran down her checks as she exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Oh, missis! don't talk so. You an' mas'r's
<pb id="sally191" n="191"/>
been kind to me. De blessed Jesus has to 
forgive us all. I'll ask him to have mercy 
'pon us;” and kneeling down, she besought 
the Lord to bless her mistress and all those 
she was leaving. Mrs. Cone followed, and 
really subdued by the influence of the hour, 
she prayed for Sally as she had, perhaps, 
never prayed for herself.</p>
          <p>Such a prayer as dat was!” said Sally, 
“'peared like de blessings she asked for me 
dere followed me all de way.”</p>
          <p>Together they went to the house, where the 
wagon was in waiting to convey Sally to the 
river, that she might be ready for the boat 
which was to take her to Mobile. Every 
thing was in readiness, and throwing her 
old cloak over her shoulders, for it was now 
December, she stepped into the wagon.</p>
          <p>“Good-by, Sally,” said her master, as he 
shook her hand.</p>
          <p>“Good-by, mas'r far'well, far'well, an' de 
Lord bless ye, an' missis, an' all de rest—I 
loves ye all, an' hopes to meet ye above.”</p>
          <p>The house servants were gathered about the 
door, and there was not one among all the 
company, master, mistress, or slave, who did 
not say, “God bless ye,” as she drove away.
<pb id="sally192" n="192"/>
A last look at her little cabin, “the house,”
and the fields around, and then feeling that 
all old ties were sundered, and that God alone 
was leading her, she bade adieu to the 
plantation for ever.</p>

          </epigraph>
          <p>On a bright morning in January, 1857, one 
of the employees of Adams' Express 
Company entered the store, on Broadway, of the 
merchant who assisted Isaac in transmitting 
the money for his mother, and going up to 
the desk, presented a “bill of lading” to the
<pb id="sally193" n="193"/>
clerk, and asked if it was “all  right?” The
clerk handed it to the merchant, who 
examined it for a moment, and then with an “All
right, sir,” gave it back again, ordering the
amount to be paid. The expressman waited
for the money, and then went out to his
wagon before the door, where, amid bales and
boxes, was one precious article of freight,
consigned to the merchant's care, nothing
less than Aunt Sally from the Alabama 
plantation!</p>
          <p>There she sat, like one bewildered, amid the
bustle and splendor of Broadway, looking
first on this side and then on that, and 
peering anxiously into the face of every colored
man who passed, as if she would fain descry
the features of her son. The man assisted
her to dismount, and the merchant, whose
heart as well as whose influence, had been
enlisted in her redemption, led the way into
the store, and gave her a seat in the farthest
corner, where she was soon surrounded by a
group of eager listeners. As she walked up
the long aisle between the laden counters, she
might have been taken for a witch of eld, or
a Meg Merrilies, so strange and grotesque was
her appearance. Her shoes were of stout,
<pb id="sally194" n="194"/>
undressed leather, such as is worn on the
plantation; her gown, that hardly reached
her ankles, was of linsey-woolsey; over her 
shoulders was thrown a long loose cloak, and 
round her head was wound a red and yellow 
Madras hand kerchief, surmounted by a 
bonnet of erect crown and brim, probably some 
cast-off finery which her mistress had worn 
twenty years before. A most remarkable 
bonnet it was—one that would not have 
disgraced Cripp's case of “Paris Styles,” or Tiff's 
description of “dem roosts o' bonnets dey 
w'ars at camp meetin's.”</p>
          <p>But Sally was all unconscious of the sensation 
her appearance created, and earnestly 
inquired for her son. She seemed much 
disappointed when told that he was away from 
the city, and might not be home for several days.</p>
          <p>“Laws now!” she exclaimed; “I thought 
he'd be de firs' one I should see when I got 
to New York.”</p>
          <p>“Do you think you shall know him,” Sally?”</p>
          <p>“Well, 'pears like I shall; but I dunno. He 
was a likely lookin' boy.”</p>
          <p>The question arose as to how she should be 
disposed of till Isaac's arrival. She knew no
<pb id="sally195" n="195"/>
one, but begged to go where she could make 
herself in some way useful. A gentleman in 
the store, Mr. L., who lived in Brooklyn, said 
that his wife's cook left her that morning, and 
that if Sally chose to assist her, she might go 
home and remain with him. To this she 
gladly consented. Meanwhile she was 
becoming accustomed to everything about her, 
and began to relate, with much ease and spirit, 
many of the incidents of her life.</p>
          <p>So the day passed, and at evening she went 
with Mr. L, to Brooklyn. She was kindly 
received by the family. A small room was 
given her for her own while she should stay, 
and she was told not to feel that she must rise 
early in the morning, but to consult her own
pleasure about what she did.</p>
          <p>Who can describe her feelings as she lay 
down that night, for the first time feeling 
that she was a free woman in a free land? 
Think of it. Sixty years old, and her birth-right 
only just attained—more than half a 
century of toil and pain before she could feel 
that she had a right to herself! “Fore dis,”
said she, “I allers felt dat I belonged to mas'r. 
My hands was mas'r's—my feet was mas'r's—
<pb id="sally196" n="196"/>
I was all mas'r's, 'cept my heart—dat was de 
Lord's.”</p>
          <p>Her thoughts were so full of prayer and 
praise that it was long before she could 
compose herself to sleep, and then it was but to 
renew in dreams the wonderful experiences 
through which she had passed, Awakened 
in the morning by the voices in the street, 
she thought it was her mistress calling her, 
and rose hastily, and commenced dressing 
herself, when she remembered where she was. 
But she did not lie down again. She went
to the kitchen, and began to assist in the
preparations for breakfast, uttering every few
moments some exclamation of surprise at the
conveniences of the house. “Laws now!”
said she, “dis yer pump's a might nice ting.
Wonder what my ole missis'd say to it. Why,
down dere we has to tote all de water from de
spring. An' dis big pile o' wood all in de shed
—I allers had to go way 'cross de field for de
wood, an' never had no help 'cept when Nero
cut a little sometimes. Poor boy! Wish he
could see dis yer. Den dat coal dat ye makes
such a han'some fire with in de parlor—never
seed no sich in Alabama. Laws! folks is so
curis up here.”</p>
          <pb id="sally197" n="197"/>
          <p>The day passed away, Sally spending most 
of it in the kitchen, assisting in the work of 
the family. “'Pears like,” said she, “dis is 
de place for me.” Two or three times Mrs. L. 
called her to come up and sit with her, and 
tell her about her life at the South. She 
would go, but her thoughts were evidently on 
her son. She inquired anxiously what time 
Mr. L. would return from New York, and 
seemed impatient for the hour to arrive. At 
length he came, but it was alone.</p>
          <p>“Well, Sally,” said he, “Isaac didn't come 
to-day; perhaps you'll see him to-morrow. 
But you mustn't be discouraged. It'll take 
some little time for him to collect money 
enough to carry you back to Detroit, where 
he lives.”</p>
          <p>Sally tried to look cheerful, and asked him, 
as she had several times done before, to 
tell her how Isaac looked, and all that he had said 
about her.</p>
          <p>Thus more than a week passed away, 
during which nothing was heard from Isaac.
Sally grew sadder and quieter with every day,
and at last really seemed ill, and took to her
bed. “At first,” said Mrs. L., “she was 
constantly singing some of her favorite hymns,
<pb id="sally198" n="198"/>
whether at work or in her room, but at length
the singing ceased altogether. I knew it was
only from anxiety on account of her son, and
I was almost as impatient for his coming as
she was.”</p>
          <p>Asking Sally, afterward, about this time of
suspense, she said,</p>
          <p>“Dey was all kind to me. I tried to put
my trust in de Lord, an' to think He'd bring
it all out right, but at last, when I didn't
hear nothin' from Isaac, I began to be afeard
't wasn't him dat sent de money, an' dat de
speculators had got me agin.”</p>
          <p>At length, when nearly two weeks had
elapsed, Isaac returned from his visit to New
Haven and the vicinity, and went straight to
the Broadway store to learn the news respecting
his mother. When told that she had 
arrived, and was actually in Brooklyn, he was
quite overcome, and felt as though he could
hardly wait an hour to see her.	</p>
          <p>“I will go to Brooklyn with you at three
o'clock,” said Mr. L. “at three o'clock this
afternoon.”</p>
          <p>Isaac had some business still to attend to,
so saying he would be back at that time, he
went out. But his thoughts were all with his
<pb id="sally199" n="199"/>
mother, and five minutes before three, by the
Trinity church clock, he entered the store. 
He waited till he heard the bell strike the 
hour, and then going up to Mr. L., who was 
busy with some gentlemen, he said—“It is 
three o'clock, sir,” thus reminding him of his
appointment. Mr. L. remembered the engagement
he had made, and in a few minutes the
two were crossing the ferry to Brooklyn. He
had a hundred questions to ask as to his 
mother's looks and appearance and conversation,
and seemed annoyed at every little delay 
of the boat or the cars upon which they went
out to the avenue where Mr. L. resided. No
wonder! He was to see her from whom he 
had been separated for twenty-five weary 
years, and whom, much of the time, he had 
thought dead. When they reached the house, 
Mr. L. took Isaac to the parlor, and gave him 
a seat, while he went to find Sally. She was 
up, and in the kitchen busily engaged in 
making custards for tea. He told her he 
wanted her to come up stairs and see some 
one who was waiting for her. She had almost 
ceased to look for Isaac, and as many of Mr. 
<sic corr="L.'s">s</sic> friends had called to see her from sympathy
<pb id="sally200" n="200"/>
and curiosity, he supposed it was one 
of them, and answered,</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, when I gets dese yer custards in 
the oven.”</p>
          <p>“But, Sally, I want you to come now.”</p>
          <p>So, all unthinking, she left the dish, took 
off her cheeked apron, put on her spectacles, 
and followed him up stairs. Daylight was 
growing dim in the curtained parlor, and the 
gas was not yet burning. Sally stood a 
moment on the threshold, looking into the room, 
and then, all at once, the truth flashed upon 
her, and she sprang forward, exclaiming, “To 
be sure, to be sure, to be sure!” and clasped 
her son her arms!</p>
          <p>She hold him tightly to her; she patted him 
as if he had been an infant; and when he 
could not speak, but only wept, she would say,</p>
          <p>“Don't cry, Isaac, don't cry. I prayed to 
de Lord dat I mightn't cry.”</p>
          <p>And he could only answer,</p>
          <p>“Oh, mother! mother! the Lord be praised!”</p>
          <p>Long they stood there, speaking not, but
clasping each other as if they could never 
more be parted. By-and-by they sat down 
upon the sofa behind them, still holding each
<pb id="sally201" n="201"/>
other's hands, and began to talk of all their
past. They were left undisturbed by the
family, and it was late that night when Issac,
after repeated farewells, left the house to
return to New York.</p>
          <p>As soon as he was gone, Sally went to find
Mr. and Mrs. L.	</p>
          <p>“Laws now!” said she, “to think dat ar's
my boy! I allers thought de Lord had  some 
thin' for him to do, but I never 'spected he'd 
be such a gentleman, an' a preacher too—de 
Lord's been very good to me”—and bidding 
them good night, she went to her room. After
the door was shut, they heard her singing one
of her favorite hymns—
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><l>“Come, saints and sinners, hear me tell </l><l>The wonders of Immanuel, </l><l>Who saved me from a burning hell, </l><l>And brought my soul with him to dwell, </l><l>And gave me heavenly union.</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Isaac had some friends among the colored 
people in New York, who were very desirous 
that he should bring his mother to stay with 
them, so the next day he came to Mrs. L.'s to 
take her away. Sally was glad to go anywhere 
with him, but she was sorry to leave 
those who had been so kind to her, and
<pb id="sally202" n="202"/>
expressed again and again to them her gratitude.
Mrs. L. made her a parting present of 
some spools of thread and some needles, with 
which she was much pleased. The story of 
her release was now noised abroad. She 
received many kindly attentions, and was 
invited to make various visits with her son. 
Among others, she came back to Brooklyn 
to spend a few days at the house of the gentleman 
who had been instrumental in her 
redemption, and it was there that the writer 
of this narrative first saw her. We were 
sitting round the blazing fire, one cold January
evening, when the door-bell rung, and
Sally and her son were ushered in. Perfectly
black, with a face wholly negro in its 
characteristics, there was yet something 
commanding in her appearance, as with majestic form
and dignified bearing she entered the room,
and, speaking to the circle with ease and 
propriety, took a seat by the fire. There was
about her that repose and self-poise to which
all polite culture aspires, but which, in her
was the result of the inward teachings of the
Spirit, and of a life of such suffering and 
privation, that she had come to regard all
earthly things as of little moment, and to look
<pb id="sally203" n="203"/>
forward with lively hope to the fruitions of the unseen.</p>
          <p>Her fantastic bonnet had given place to a 
close silk hood, and her awkward shoes, to a 
more elegant and comfortable pair; otherwise 
her dress was the same. And there, in that
brightly lighted room, with the snow blowing 
against the panes without, she went over the 
story of her life, which has been reproduced, 
as nearly as possible in her own words, in 
these pages. It was wonderful, the entire 
absence of malice or revenge from her thoughts 
and words. She seemed to have forgiven all, 
and to love all, for the sake of her great 
master. Her simple piety, her ideas of self-sacrifice, 
and entire submission to the divine will, 
reminded one of Madame Guyon's highest 
spiritual flights.</p>
          <p>The sabbath came, and Sally accompanied 
the family to Plymouth Church. While in 
New York, she had seen the Rev. Dr. 
Thompson, and was very desirous to hear him 
preach, but the Tabernacle was full the 
morning she went there, and she was unable 
to obtain a seat except so near the door that 
she could not hear the sermon. So now she 
was seated just beneath the platform, where
<pb id="sally204" n="204"/>
every word would be distinctly audible. She 
was a member of the Baptist church in 
Alabama, and had heard no preaching there, save 
now and then a sermon from the ministers of 
that persuasion. The deep tones of the organ 
and the singing of the hymns by the whole 
congregation, were quite new to her. The 
sermon was on of those lucid presentations 
of truth for which Mr. Beecher is remarkable, 
satisfying the most logical intellect, and yet 
apparent to the simplest heart. It was 
evident that Sally lost not a word. Speaking of 
it when we reached home, “Why,” said she, 
“I used to think all churches but de Babtis'
worshiped idols, but I jes' made up my mind 
when I heard dat ar sermon, dat I never'd
refuse gwine into no church agin, so long as 
I lived in dis low ground o' sorrow. It made 
me feel bad 'bout mas'r. 'Pears like it's 
<hi rend="italics">impossible</hi> for mas'r to got to heaven. He 
don't cheat, nor tell lies, but den he don't 
bring himself up to what de preacher said dis 
mornin'. Laws! if I could a' heard dat 
sermon down dere, sometimes, when I felt so 
bad! But den 'peared like de Lord Jesus 
talked to me, an' dat was best of all. Poor 
mas'r, I hopes he'll get to heaven. I won't
<pb id="sally205" n="205"/>
judge no one. We's all got to be judged one 
o' dese mornin's.”</p>
          <p>A moment, and she exclaimed, “What a 
'markable pra'r dat was! So humble, so
beggin', so coaxin', to every poor sinner. I 
took partic'lar notice o' dat ar pra'r. Den 
de singin'—it made me think o' de hymn.
<q type="song" direct="unspecified"><lg type="song"><l>‘We'll join de forty thousand </l><l>Upon de golden shore!’”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Her expressions of surprise and delight at 
any elegances about the house were amusing.</p>
          <p>“Why,” said she, “I'se seen more at de 
North dan I thought was in de world. If I 
should go back an' tell 'em 'bout it, dey 
wouldn't believe me. Wonder what missis'd 
say to dis yer carpet, an' dem picters hangin' 
up dere? Well, dey's all very nice, if ye don't 
got yer hearts set on 'em. Ye mus'n't do dat, 
'cause I 'specs dey aint <hi rend="italics">nothin'</hi> to what we 
shall see in de New Jerusalem.”</p>
          <p>There was a poor, indolent colored girl, who 
came occasionally to the house to beg. Sally 
was indignant that one who was well and able 
to work should live upon charity, and, feeling 
that she had a right to speak to one of her 
own race, she went out to the side-gate where
<pb id="sally206" n="206"/>
the girl was in waiting, and reproved her 
severely for her mode of life. As for herself, 
she put her principles in practice, for although 
she was told to do only what she pleased, she 
chose to be busy, and asked the privilege 
of preparing for the table various palatable 
dishes which are peculiar to the South.</p>
          <p>Before she left, the, lady of the house asked 
her to pray with her for her children, and she 
said it was affecting to hear her simple, earnest 
words, as she besought “de great Mas'r above 
to bless dis dear young missis an' her chil'n.”</p>
          <p>Isaac's business was now done, his money 
collected, and he was anxious to take his 
mother to his home. She, too, was impatient 
to see his wife and children. They were 
detained some days longer than they intended 
by the violent snow-storms which rendered 
traveling difficult; but, at length, with the 
blessings of all who had known them, they 
left New York for their home in Detroit.</p>
          <p>“Far'well, far'well,” said Sally, as she went 
away; “de Lord bless ye all for yer kindness 
to me, an' bring us all together agin in 
de kingdom!” </p>

          <p>THE following letter was received from 
Isaac, shortly after he and his mother reached 
Detroit:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">

                    <dateline>DETROIT, Michigan, Feb. 10, 1857.</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>My feelings can be better imagined than
described as I left New York and turned my
face homeward, accompanied by my mother.
Every thing around seemed engaged to make
us happy, and often joyful expressions would 
be heard from mother, as if she had but just
<pb id="sally208" n="208"/>
begun to feel that she was a free woman. We
went to Dunkirk by means of a pass given us
to that point by the gentlemanly president
of the Erie Railroad Company. As the cars
moved from Jersey City, we each gave one
hearty “Thank God!” that we had at last
started for our home. We had not gone far
before we became the subject of remark among
the passengers. Curiosity led many to want
to know something about the strangely dressed
old negro woman, and they would pass and
look at us inquiringly. At length, one asked
mother whence she came, and where she was
going, to which she said,</p>
                  <p>“'s all de way from Alabama, an' I's
gwine home with my son. He's bought me.”</p>
                  <p>I went into another car for a few minutes,
and as I came back I found a crowd around
her, each one, listening with attention to what
she was saying. Her eyes seemed to assist
her mouth in telling her story. The news
soon spread from one car to another—“A
mother bought by her son!” As I heard
the comments that were passed upon it, I
must say that it seemed to me the proudest
and happiest period of my life. At dinner
time, a gentleman said to me. “Take the old
<pb id="sally209" n="209"/>
lady out to dinner, and I will pay for you 
both,” which he did. So we went on till we 
reached Dunkirk, where we took the cars for 
Buffalo. We had a kind reception at Buffalo, 
and money enough was added to our little 
store to send us home. We reached Windsor, 
opposite Detroit, at half-past 11 o'clock in the 
evening of February 2d.</p>
                  <p>“Is dis whar we's gwine to stop?” said mother.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, no; this is only the end of the railroad.”</p>
                  <p>“Den ain't I gwine no more on de cars?”</p>
                  <p>“No, we're almost home.”</p>
                  <p>We now went down to the water's edge to 
get on board the ferryboat to cross the river.</p>
                  <p>“Are we gwine on dis yere place, Isaac?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, mother, this is the boat.”</p>
                  <p>We seated ourselves in the saloon, and were 
soon landed safely on the Detroit side.</p>
                  <p>“Is <hi rend="italics">dis</hi> de place whar we's to stop?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, this is the place.”</p>
                  <p>“Thank de Lord! I's done got over travelin'. 
Now I wants to see de chil'en. Come, 
let's go;” and she started on as if she had a 
perfect knowledge of the way.</p>
                  <p>“Stop, mother, we're not going out yet.
<pb id="sally210" n="210"/>
It's a good ways, and I must got some kind 
of a carriage to take the trunks up, so we'll 
ride.”</p>
                  <p>“I can walk, Isaac, I's been so much trouble 
an' 'spense to ye dat I don't want ye to spend 
another penny for me.”</p>
                  <p>But a carriage was procured, and soon we 
were seated within and on our way through 
the dark and silent streets to the humble but 
much-loved home whence I had been absent 
since July, 1856.</p>
                  <p>Mother was silent till the carriage stopped 
at the gate. Then she said—</p>
                  <p>“Is dis de house?”</p>
                  <p>“Yes, mother.”</p>
                  <p>“Den I aint got to go no whar agin.”</p>
                  <p>“No, we are at home now.”</p>
                  <p>I got out and gave her my hand to help her 
out, but she stepped down alone, and went up 
to the door, waiting till it should be opened. 
It was now twelve o'clock, and the family 
were all in bed, but a few hard and familiar 
raps on the door were sufficient to rouse 
them. Soon my wife opened the window and 
exclaimed, “I know that voice,” and laughing 
for pure joy, she called out to the children 
the welcome news,</p>
                  <pb id="sally211" n="211"/>
                  <p>“Pa and grandma's come!”</p>
                  <p>And without stopping for many clothes, 
they ran down and opened the door, and 
received us with the heartiest expressions 
of love and kindness. Some one then opened 
the door of the front room, and mother passed 
into it, and I presented each one separately 
to her.</p>
                  <p>“Oh, mother! mother!” said my wife, “I'm 
so glad to see you!”</p>
                  <p>“And I too, and I too,” said all the rest. 
Mother had heard me tell of each one and 
learnt their names long before, so looking 
around upon them, she said, “Whir's Mary?”</p>
                  <p>“Mary, my oldest child, is married and
lives near by. She with her husband was at
once sent for, and came, with her baby in her
arms. After the most cordial greetings had 
been exchanged, mother seemed satisfied, and 
exclaimed—</p>
                  <p>“Thanks to de good Lord! He's been so 
good to me. See what He's done for me. 
Glory and honor to His name! I'd almos' 
gin out, but de Lord He prepared de way.</p>
                  <p>“Chil'n, I can't tell you how glad I is 
to see you all!”</p>
                  <p>An hour and a half passed away before we
<pb id="sally212" n="212"/>
really know it, and the clock striking two, 
reminded us that we must let the children 
go back to bed, and take a luncheon ourselves.
But before we separated, all joined in singing
this good old hymn:</p>
                  <lg type="song">
                    <lg type="stanza">
                      <l>“And are we yet alive</l>
                      <l>And see each other's face?</l>
                      <l>Glory and praise to Jesus give,</l>
                      <l>For His redeeming grace.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                      <l>“What troubles have we seen;</l>
                      <l>What conflicts have we passed;</l>
                      <l>Fighting's without, and foes within,</l>
                      <l>Since we assembled last.</l>
                    </lg>
                    <lg type="stanza">
                      <l>“But out of all, the Lord</l>
                      <l>Has brought us by His love;</l>
                      <l>And still He doth His help afford,</l>
                      <l>And hide our life above.</l>
                    </lg>
                  </lg>
                  <p>Never in all my life did I feel just as I did 
then in prayer to Him who had permitted us 
to meet around one common altar. That night 
will long live in the memory of the family.</p>
                  <p>About nine o'clock the next morning, all 
came together again for devotions, and 
afterward we partook of a refreshing meal. Now 
mother could fully be seen, walking from one 
part of the house to another. She seemed 
perfectly happy, and would exclaim,
<pb id="sally213" n="213"/>
“How well you's fixed up! Every thing's 
so nice! Well, I dunno what to say, only I 
thank de Lord for it.”</p>

          <p>And this is the mother and this is the
son, who, through such peril and labor, have 
escaped from bondage into freedom. The 
facts need no comments. They are eloquent 
enough of themselves. But when we remember 
that those are not isolated cases, but that 
every day there is this suffering and strife for 
liberty, with only now and then one fortunate 
enough to obtain it, they become “trumpet-tongued,” 
and plead with us to rest not till all 
over the land liberty shall no longer be a <hi rend="italics">name</hi> 
only, but the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> and <hi rend="italics">blessing</hi> of every creature.</p>
          <p>Sally was somewhat affected by the change 
of climate. When a slave at Fayetteville, 
one of her feet was injured while she was at 
work in the field. It had never been very 
strong, and now the intense cold increased 
the lameness, so that, for sometime she could 
hardly walk; but at the coming on of the 
warmer weather she recovered. Since she 
went to Detroit, she has been very desirous 
to obtain work as a cook by the week or the 
month, in order to assist her son, and also for 
her own peace of mind.</p>
          <pb id="sally214" n="214"/>
          <p>“Oh!” says she, “when I ain't doin' 
nothin' I's all de time thinkin' on 'em down 
dere in Alabama. Poor creeters! dey wants 
to be free, an' dey can't. I feel so bad for 
'em! 'Pears like I mus' be busy to keep dese 
yer thoughts out 'o my head.”</p>
          <p>But Isaac thinks his mother has labored 
long enough, and is not willing she should 
leave his home. She seems entirely happy 
in his family, and does every thing in her 
power to contribute to the household comfort, 
and, in return, all try to make her life 
pleasant. She makes a great pet of Isaac's 
youngest child, a little girl, three years old, 
who, she thinks, resembles the little Lewis 
that was sold from her at Fayetteville. One 
day a lady called to see Sally, and, going 
into the house, saw only this little child.</p>
          <p>“Where's your grandma?” said she.</p>
          <p>“O I 'spose she's singin' 'bout her Jesus,”
was the answer. When Sally entered, the 
lady began to talk to her about her life, and, 
merely to see what reply she would make, 
asked her if all that was published about her 
in the papers was true.</p>
          <p>“Oh!” said she, “every word on 't—every 
word on't! When dey reads it to me, it
<pb id="sally215" n="215"/>
makes me feel sick, it brings back de ole 
times so. Den I thinks so much 'bout all 
dem I's lef' behind. I wish dey was free. I 
do so! I haint forgot 'em, none of 'em, nor 
poor mas'r nor missis.”</p>
          <p>“I suppose you enjoy it very much to have 
your time to yourself?” said the lady.</p>
          <p>“Yes, indeed! 'pears like it is so nice to lie 
a-bed in de mornin jes' as long as I please. I 
use to think about it in Alabama, an' wonder 
if de time ever'd come when I should'nt have 
to get up soon as de day broke.”</p>
          <p>Sally never goes from home without her
“free papers,” lest in some way her dearly
prized liberty should be endangered. She
has made many visits in Detroit and the
vicinity, and been received and treated with
kind attention by those who knew her
history. She greatly enjoys hearing her son
preach on the Sabbath, and is interested in
all he is doing, and desires to help him.
Uniformly cheerful, she looks at her mercies rather
than her trials. She knows not whether her
first husband is living or dead. She has never
heard a word from her little Lewis, since the
trader told her of his having been sold at
Claiborne. When she last heard of her son
<pb id="sally216" n="216"/>
Daniel, he was in jail in Virginia, having 
escaped from a cruel master in North Carolina, 
and fled toward the North, and been 
taken up and imprisoned as a runaway slave. 
She prays for them all, but she looks at Isaac 
and is happy.</p>
          <p>In every affliction she has trusted the Lord, 
and felt that He could turn her sorrows to 
blessings. Truly, to her the CROSS has been 
the WAY OF FREEDOM.</p>
