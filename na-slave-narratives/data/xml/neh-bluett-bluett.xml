          <p>HAVING had occasion to
inform my self of many
considerable and curious
Circumstances of the Life
of JOB, the <hi rend="italics">African</hi> Priest,
in a more exact and particular Manner than
the Generality of his Acquaintance in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>
could do; I was desired by himself, a little
before his Departure, to draw up an Account of
him agreeable to
<pb id="bluett10" n="10"/>
the Information he had given me at different
Times, and to the Truth of the Facts, which I
had either been a Witness to, or personally
concerned in upon his Account. I have been
solicited also by several Gentlemen, who were
Benefactors to JOB, to publish what I knew
of him: And I am of opinion such an Account is
pretty generally wanted; at least it cannot but be
agreeable to those Persons, who were pleased
to do kind Offices to this Stranger, merely from
a Principle of Humanity, before any particular
Account of him could be had.
Therefore I have at length resolved to
communicate to the World such Particulars
of the Life and Character of this <hi rend="italics">African</hi>
Gentleman, as I think will be most useful and
entertaining; intending to advance nothing as
Fact, but what I either knew to be such, or have
had from JOB's own Mouth, whose Veracity I
have no reason to doubt of.</p>
          <pb id="bluett11" n="11"/>
          <p>Pursuant to this Resolution, I shall
not trouble my Reader with any very
long and particular Detail of the Geography,
History, or Rarities of that
Country of <hi rend="italics">Africa</hi> which JOB belongs
to; nor shall I meddle any farther with
these Matters, in the present Account,
than to relate such Observations concerning
them, as JOB himself made to me
in Conversation; being either not generally
known, or so curious as to bear a
Repetition here, consistently with the
Design of these Memoirs. However, I
shall endeavour to make the whole as
agreeable as the Nature of the Subject,
and the Limits of this Pamphlet will
allow; and therefore, without any farther
Preface, shall proceed to the Thing
propos'd.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italics">An Account of the Family of</hi> JOB;
<hi rend="italics">his Education; and the more
remarkable Circumstances of his
Life, before he was taken Captive.</hi></p>
          </argument>
          <p>J<hi rend="italics">OB's</hi> Countrymen, like the Eastern
People and some others, use to design
themselves by the Names of their
Ancestors, and in their Appellations mention their
Progenitors several Degrees
backward; tho' they also have Sirnames
for distinguishing their particular Families,
much after the same Manner as
in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>. JOB's Name, in his own
Country, is HYUBA, BOON SALUMENA,
BOON HIBRAHEMA; <hi rend="italics">i.e. JOB</hi>, the Son 
of <hi rend="italics">Solomon</hi>, the Son of <hi rend="italics">Abraham</hi>. The Sirname
of his Family is <hi rend="italics">Jallo</hi>.</p>
          <p>JOB, who is now about 31 or 32 Years of
age, was born at a Town called <hi rend="italics">Boonda</hi>
<pb id="bluett13" n="13"/>
in the County of <hi rend="italics">Galumbo</hi> (in our Maps
<hi rend="italics">Catumbo</hi>) in the Kingdom of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi> in
<hi rend="italics">Africa</hi>; which lies on both Sides the
River <hi rend="italics">Senegal</hi>, and on the south Side
reaches as far as, the River <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>.
These two Rivers, JOB assured me, run
pretty near parallel to one another, and
never meet, contrary to the Position they
have in most of our Maps. The Eastern
Boundary of the Kingdom of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">Senega</hi> is the great Lake, called in our
Maps <hi rend="italics">Lacus Guarde</hi>. The Extent of it,
towards the North, is not so certain.
The chief City or Town of it is <hi rend="italics">Tombut</hi>;
over against which, on the other side of
the River, is <hi rend="italics">Boonda</hi>, the Place of JOB's
Nativity.</p>
          <p>About fifty Years ago <hi rend="italics">Hibrahim</hi>, the
Grandfather of JOB, founded the Town of
<hi rend="italics">Boonda</hi>, in the Reign of <hi rend="italics">Bubaker</hi>, then King of
<hi rend="italics">Futa</hi>, and was, by his Permission, sole Lord
Proprietor and Governor of it, and at the same
Time High 
<pb id="bluett14" n="14"/>
Priest, or <hi rend="italics">Alpha</hi>; so that he had a Power
to make what Laws and Regulations he
thought proper for the Increase
and good Government of his new City. Among
other Institutions, one was, that no Person who
flies thither for Protection shall be made a Slave.
This Privilege is in force there to this Day, and is
extended to all in general, that can read and know
God, as they express it; and it has contributed
much to the Peopling of the Place, which is now
very large and flourishing. Some time after the
Settlement of this Town <hi rend="italics">Hibrahim</hi> died; and, as
the Priesthood is hereditary there, <hi rend="italics">Salumen</hi> his
Son, the Father of JOB, became High Priest.
About the same Time <hi rend="italics">Bubaker</hi> the King dying, his
Brother <hi rend="italics">Gelazi</hi>, who was next Heir, succeeded
him. <hi rend="italics">Gelazi</hi> had a Son, named <hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi>, whom he
put under the Care of Salumen, JOB's Father, to
learn the <hi rend="italics">Koran</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi> Language. JOB
was at this Time also with his Father, was
Companion to <hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi>, and studied
<pb id="bluett15" n="15"/>
along with him. <hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi>, upon the Death of
<hi rend="italics">Gelazi</hi>, was made King of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi>, and reigns there
at present. When JOB was fifteen Years old, he
assisted his Father as <hi rend="italics">Emaum</hi>, or Sub-priest.
About this Age he married the Daughter of the
Alpha of <hi rend="italics">Tombut</hi>, who was then only eleven
Years old. By her he had a Son (when she was
thirteen Years old) called<hi rend="italics"> Abdolah</hi>; and after
that two more Sons, called <hi rend="italics">Hibrahim</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi>. About two Years before his Captivity
he married a second Wife, Daughter of the
Alpha of <hi rend="italics">Tomga</hi>; by whom he has a Daughter
named <hi rend="italics">Fatima</hi>, after the Daughter of their
Prophet <hi rend="italics">Mahommed</hi>. Both these Wives, with
their Children, were alive when he came from
Home.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>
              <hi rend="italics">Of the Manner of his being taken
Captive; and what followed upon
it, till his Return.</hi>
            </p>
          </argument>
          <p>IN <hi rend="italics">February</hi>, 1730. JOB's Father
hearing of an <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Ship at <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>
River, sent him, with two Servants to
attend him, to sell two Negroes and to
buy Paper, and some other Necessaries;
but desired him not to venture over the
River, because the Country of the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi>,
who are Enemies to the People
of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi>, lies on the other side. JOB not
agreeing with Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> (who commanded the
Ship, lying then at <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>,
in the Service of Captain <hi rend="italics">Henry Hunt</hi>,
Brother to Mr. <hi rend="italics">William Hunt</hi>, Merchant,
in <hi rend="italics">Little Tower-Street, London</hi>) sent back
the two Servants to acquaint his Father
with it, and to let him know that he
intended to go farther. Accordingly,
<pb id="bluett17" n="17"/>
having agreed with another Man, named
<hi rend="italics">Loumein Yoas</hi>, who understood the
<hi rend="italics">Mandingoe</hi> Language, to go with him as his
Interpreter, he crossed the River <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>,
and disposed of his Negroes for some
Cows. As he was returning Home, he
stopp'd for some Refreshment at the
House of an old Acquaintance; and the
Weather being hot, he hung up his Arms
in the House, while he refresh'd himself.
Those Arms were very valuable; consisting of a 
Gold-hilted Sword, a Gold
Knife, which they wear by their Side,
and a rich Quiver of Arrows, which
King <hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi> had made him a Present of.
It happened that a Company of the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi>,
who live upon Plunder, passing
by at that Time, and observing him unarmed,
rush'd in, to the Number of seven
or eight at once, at a back Door, and
pinioned JOB, before he could get to his
Arms, together with his Interpreter, who
is a Slave in <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> still. They then
shaved their Heads and Beards, which
<pb id="bluett18" n="18"/>
JOB and his Man resented as the highest Indignity;
tho' the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi> meant no more by it, than to
make them appear like Slaves taken in War. On
the 27th of <hi rend="italics">February</hi>, 1730. they carried them to
Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> at <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>, who purchased them;
and on the first of <hi rend="italics">March</hi> they were put on Board.
Soon after JOB found means to acquaint
Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> that he was the same Person that
came to trade with him a few Days before, and
after what Manner he had been taken. Upon this
Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> gave him leave to redeem himself
and his Man; and JOB sent to an Acquaintance
of his Father's, near <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>, who promised to
send to JOB's Father, to inform him of what had happened, that he
might take some Course to have him set at Liberty.
But it being a Fortnight's journey between that
Friend's House and his Father's, and the Ship
failing in about a Week after, JOB was
brought with the rest of the Slaves to <hi rend="italics">Annapolis</hi>
in <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>,
<pb id="bluett19" n="19"/>
and delivered to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Vachell Denton</hi>,
Factor to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi>, before mentioned. JOB
heard since, by Vessels that came from <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>,
that his Father sent down several Slaves, a little
after Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> failed, in order to procure his
Redemption; and that <hi rend="italics">Sambo</hi>, King of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi>,
had made War upon the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi>, and cut
off great Numbers of them, upon account of the
Injury they had done to his Schoolfellow.</p>
          <p>Mr. <hi rend="italics">Vachell Denton</hi> sold JOB to one Mr.
<hi rend="italics">Tolsey</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Kent</hi> Island in <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>, who put him
to work in making Tobacco; but he was soon
convinced that JOB had never been used to
such Labour. He every Day shewed more and
more Uneasiness under this Exercise, and at last
grew sick, being no way able to bear it; so that
his Master was obliged to find easier Work for
him, and therefore put him to tend the Cattle.
JOB would often leave the Cattle, and
<pb id="bluett20" n="20"/>
withdraw into the Woods to pray; but a white Boy
frequently watched him, and whilst he was at his
Devotion would mock him, and throw Dirt in his
Face. This very much disturbed JOB, and
added to his other Misfortunes; all which were
increased by his Ignorance of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
Language, which prevented his complaining, or
telling his Case to any Person about him. Grown
in some measure desperate, by reason of his
present Hardships, he resolved to travel at a
Venture; thinking he might possibly be taken up
by some Master, who would use him better, or
otherwise meet with some lucky Accident, to
divert or abate his Grief. Accordingly, he
travelled thro' the Woods, till he came to the
County of <hi rend="italics">Kent</hi>, upon <hi rend="italics">Delaware Bay</hi>, now
esteemed Part of <hi rend="italics">Pensilvania</hi>; altho' it is
properly a Part of <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi>, and belongs to
my Lord <hi rend="italics">Baltimore</hi>. There is a Law in force,
throughout the Colonies of <hi rend="italics">Virginia,
Maryland, Pensilvania</hi>,

&amp;c. as far as <hi rend="italics">Boston</hi> in <hi rend="italics">New England</hi>, viz.
That any Negroe, or white Servant who is not
known in the County, or has no Pass, may be
secured by any Person, and kept in the common
Goal, till the Master of such Servant shall fetch
him. Therefore JOB being able to give no
Account of himself, was put in Prison there.</p>
          <p>This happened about the Beginning of <hi rend="italics">June</hi>,
1731<corr>,</corr> when I, who was attending the Courts
there, and had heard of JOB, went with several
Gentlemen to the Goaler's House, being a
Tavern, and desired to see him. He was brought
into the Tavern to us, but could not speak one
Word of <hi rend="italics">English</hi>. Upon our Talking and
making Signs to him, he wrote a Line or two
before us, and when he read it, pronounced the
Words <hi rend="italics">Allah</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Mahommed</hi>; by which, and
his refusing a Glass of Wine we offered him,
we perceived he was a <hi rend="italics">Mahometan</hi>, but
<pb id="bluett22" n="22"/>
could not imagine of what Country he was, or
how he got thither; for by his affable Carriage,
and the easy Composure of his Countenance,
we could perceive he was no common Slave.</p>
          <p>When JOB had been some time confined,
an old Negroe Man, who lived in
that Neighbourhood, and could speak
the <hi rend="italics">Jalloff</hi> Language, which JOB also
understood, went to him, and conversed
with him. By this Negroe the Keeper
was informed to whom JOB belonged,
and what was the Cause of his leaving
his Master. The Keeper thereupon wrote
to his Master, who soon after fetch'd him
home, and was much kinder to him than
before; allowing him a Place to pray
in, and some other Conveniencies, in
order to make his Slavery as easy as possible. Yet
Slavery and Confinement was by no means
agreeable to JOB, who had never been used
to it; he therefore wrote a Letter in <hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi> to
his Father,
<pb id="bluett23" n="23"/>
acquainting him with his Misfortunes,
hoping he might yet find Means to
redeem him. This Letter he sent
to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Vachell Denton</hi>, desiring it might be sent
to <hi rend="italics">Africa</hi> by Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi>; but he being gone to
<hi rend="italics">England</hi>, Mr. <hi rend="italics">Denton</hi> sent the Letter inclosed
to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi>, in order to be sent to <hi rend="italics">Africa</hi> by
Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi> from <hi rend="italics">England</hi>; but Captain <hi rend="italics">Pike</hi>
had sailed for <hi rend="italics">Africa</hi> before the Letter came to
Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi>, who therefore kept it in his own
Hands, till he should have a proper Opportunity
of sending it. It happened that this Letter was
seen by <hi rend="italics">James Oglethorpe</hi>, Esq; who,
according to his usual Goodness and
Generosity, took Compassion on JOB, and
gave his Bond to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> for the Payment of a
certain Sum, upon the Delivery of JOB here in
<hi rend="italics">England</hi>. Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> upon this sent to Mr.
<hi rend="italics">Denton</hi>, who purchas'd him again of his Master
for the same Money which Mr. <hi rend="italics">Denton</hi> had
formerly received for him; his Master being very
willing
<pb id="bluett24" n="24"/>
to part with him, as finding him no ways fit for
his Business.</p>
          <p>He lived some time with Mr. <hi rend="italics">Denton</hi> at
<hi rend="italics">Annapolis</hi>, before any Ship could stir out,
upon account of the Ice that lay in all the Rivers
of <hi rend="italics">Maryland</hi> at that Time. In this Interval he
became acquainted with the Reverend Mr.
<hi rend="italics">Henderson</hi>, a Gentleman of great Learning,
Minister of <hi rend="italics">Annapolis</hi>, and Commissary to the
Bishop of <hi rend="italics">London</hi>, who gave JOB the Character
of a Person of great Piety and Learning; and
indeed his good Nature and Affability gain'd him
many Friends besides in that Place.</p>
          <p>In <hi rend="italics">March</hi>, 1733<corr>,</corr> he set sail in the <hi rend="italics">William</hi>,
Captain <hi rend="italics">George Uriel</hi> Commander; in which
Ship I was also a Passenger. The Character
which the Captain and I had of him at
<hi rend="italics">Annapolis</hi>, induced us to teach him as much
of the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Language as we could, he being
<pb id="bluett25" n="25"/>
then able to speak but few Words of it,
and those hardly intelligible. This we
set about as soon as we were out at
Sea, and in about a Fortnight's Time taught him
all his Letters, and to spell almost any single
Syllable, when distinctly pronounced to him; but
JOB and my self falling sick, we were hindered
from making any greater Progress at that Time.
However, by the Time that we arrived in
<hi rend="italics">England</hi>, which was the latter End
of <hi rend="italics">April</hi>, 1733<corr>,</corr> he had learned so much of our
Language, that he was able to understand most
of what we said in common Conversation; and
we that were used to his Manner of Speaking,
could make shift to understand him tolerably
well.
During the Voyage, he was very constant in
his Devotions; which he never omitted, on any
Pretence, notwithstanding we had exceeding bad
Weather all the time we were at Sea. We often
<pb id="bluett26" n="26"/>
permitted him to kill our fresh Stock, that he might
eat of it himself; for he eats no Flesh, unless he
has killed the Animal with his own Hands, or
knows that it has been killed by some
<hi rend="italics">Mussulman</hi>. He has no Scruple about Fish; but
won't touch a bit of Pork, it being <sic corr="expressly">expresly</sic>
forbidden by their Law. By his good Nature and
Affability he gained the good Will of all the
Sailors, who (not to mention other kind Offices)
all the way up the Channel shewed him the Head
Lands and remarkable Places; the Names of
which JOB wrote down carefully, together with
the Accounts that were given him about them.
His Reason for so doing, he told me, was, that if
he met with any <hi rend="italics">Englishman</hi> in his Country, he
might by these Marks be able to convince him
that he had been in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>.</p>
          <p>On our Arrival in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>, we heard that
Mr. <hi rend="italics">Oglethorpe</hi> was gone to <hi rend="italics">Georgia</hi>, and that
Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> had provided a Lodging
<pb id="bluett27" n="27"/>
for JOB at <hi rend="italics">Limehouse</hi>. After I had
visited my Friends in the Country, I went up on
purpose to see JOB. He was, very sorrowful,
and told me, that Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> had been applied to
by some Persons to sell him, who pretended
they would send him home; but he feared they
would either sell him again as a
Slave, or if they sent him home would expect an
unreasonable Ransom for him. I took him to
<hi rend="italics">London</hi> with me, and waited on Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi>, to
desire leave to carry him to <hi rend="italics">Cheshunt</hi> in <hi rend="italics">Hartfordshire</hi>;
which Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> comply'd with. He told me he
had been apply'd to, as JOB had suggested, but
did not intend to part with him without his own
Consent; but as Mr. <hi rend="italics">Oglethorpe</hi> was out of
<hi rend="italics">England</hi>, if any of JOB's Friends would pay the
Money, he would accept of it, provided
they would undertake to send him home safely
to his own Country. I also obtained his
Promise that he would not
<pb id="bluett28" n="28"/>
dispose of him till he heard farther from me.</p>
          <p>JOB, while he was at <hi rend="italics">Cheshunt</hi>, had the
Honour to be sent for by most of the Gentry of
that Place, who were mightily pleased with his
Company, and concerned for his Misfortunes.
They made him several handsome Presents, and
proposed that a Subscription should be made for
the Payment of the Money to Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi>. The
Night before we set out for <hi rend="italics">London</hi> from
<hi rend="italics">Cheshunt</hi>, a Footman belonging to <hi rend="italics">Samuel
Holden</hi>, Esq; brought a Letter to JOB, which
was, I think, directed to Sir <hi rend="italics">Byby Lake</hi>. The
Letter was delivered at the <hi rend="italics">African</hi> House; 
upon which the House was pleased to order that
Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hunt</hi> should bring in a Bill of the whole
Charges which he had been at about JOB, and
be there paid; which was accordingly done, and
the Sum amounted to Fifty-nine Pounds, Six
Shillings, and eleven
<pb id="bluett29" n="29"/>
Pence Half-penny. This Sum being paid, Mr.
<hi rend="italics">Oglethorpe's</hi> Bond was deliver'd up to the
Company. JOB's Fears were now over, with
respect to his being sold again as a Slave; yet he
could not be persuaded but that he must pay an
extravagant Ramson, when he got home. I
confess, I doubted much of the Success of a
Subscription, the Sum being great, and JOB's
Acquaintance in <hi rend="italics">England</hi> being so small; 
therefore, to ease JOB's Mind, I spoke to a
Gentleman about the Affair, who has all along
been JOB's Friend in a very remarkable Manner.
This Gentleman was so far from discouraging the
Thing, that he began the Subscription himself with
a handsome Sum, and promised his further
Assistance at a dead Lift. Not to be tedious:
Several Friends, both in <hi rend="italics">London</hi> and in the
Country, gave in their charitable Contributions
very readily; yet the Sum was so large, that the
Subscription was about twenty Pounds short of
it; but that generous and worthy
<pb id="bluett30" n="30"/>
Gentleman before mentioned, was pleased to
make up the Defect, and the whole Sum was
<sic corr="completed">compleated</sic>.</p>
          <p>I went (being desired) to propose the Matter
to the <hi rend="italics">African</hi> Company; who, after having
heard what I had to say, shew'd me the Orders
that the House had made; which were, that
JOB should be accommodated at the <hi rend="italics">African</hi>
House at the Company's Expence, till one of the
Company's Ships should go to <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>, in which
he should be sent back to his Friends without
any Ransom. The Company then ask'd me, if
they could do any Thing more to make JOB
easy; and upon my Desire, they order'd, that Mr.
<hi rend="italics">Oglethorpe's</hi> Bond should be cancelled, which
was presently done, and that JOB should have
his Freedom in Form, which he received
handsomely engross'd with the Company's Seal
affixed; after which the full Sum of the whole
Charges (<hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> Fifty-nine Pounds,
<pb id="bluett31" n="31"/>
Six Shillings, and eleven Pence Half-penny) was
paid in to their Clerk, as was before proposed.</p>
          <p>JOB's Mind being now perfectly easy, and
being himself more known, he went <sic corr="cheerfully">chearfully</sic>
among his Friends to several Places, both in
Town and Country, One Day being at Sir <hi rend="italics">Hans
Sloan's</hi>, he expressed his great Desire to see the
Royal Family. Sir <hi rend="italics">Hans</hi> promised to get him
introduced, when he had Clothes proper to go
in. JOB knew how kind a Friend he had to
apply to upon occasion; and he was soon
<sic corr="clothed">cloathed</sic> in a rich silk Dress, made up after his
own Country Fashion, and introduced to their
Majesties, and the rest of the Royal Family. Her
Majesty was pleased to present him with a rich
Gold Watch; and the same Day he had the
Honour to dine with his Grace the Duke of
<hi rend="italics">Mountague</hi>, and some others of the Nobility,
who were pleased to make him a handsome
Present after
<pb id="bluett32" n="32"/>
Dinner. His Grace, after that, was pleased
to take JOB often into the Country
with him, and shew him the Tools that
are necessary for Tilling the Ground,
both in Gardens and Fields, and made
his Servants shew him how to use them;
and afterwards his Grace furnished JOB
with all Sorts of such Instruments,
and several other rich Presents, which he
ordered to be carefully done up in Chests,
and put on Board for his Use. 'Tis not
possible for me to recollect the many
Favours he received from his Grace,
and several other Noblemen and Gentlemen,
who shewed a singular Generosity towards
him; only, I may say in general,
that the Goods which were given him,
and which he carried over with him,
were worth upwards of 500 Pounds;
besides which, he was well furnished
with Money, in case any Accident
should oblige him to go on Shore, or
occasion particular Charges at Sea. About
the latter End of <hi rend="italics">July</hi> last he embark'd
<pb id="bluett33" n="33"/>
on Board one of the <hi rend="italics">African</hi> Company's
Ships, bound for <hi rend="italics">Gambia</hi>; where we
hope he is safely arrived, to the great
Joy of his Friends, and the Honour of
the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Nation.</p>

            <p><hi rend="italics">Some</hi> Observations, <hi rend="italics">as related by</hi>
JOB, <hi rend="italics">concerning the</hi> Manners
<hi rend="italics">and</hi> Opinions <hi rend="italics">of his Countrymen</hi>.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I Don't pretend here, as I hinted before,
to trouble the Reader or my
self with a full and regular History of
JOB's Country. Those who have the
Curiosity to inform themselves more particularly
in the History of those Parts of
the World, may consult the Voyages
that are already published on that Subject. I shall
only take Notice of some
occasional Remarks upon the Customs
of the Country, as I had them in Conversation
from JOB himself.</p>
          <p>It is pretty commonly known that the
<hi rend="italics">Africans</hi> in general, especially those in the
inland Countries, are inured from their
Infancy to a hard and low Life,
<pb id="bluett35" n="35"/>
being great Strangers to the Luxury and Delicacy
of most of the Countries of <hi rend="italics">Europe</hi>. They have
the Necessaries of Life, 'tis true, and might have
many of the Conveniences of it too; but such is
the Simplicity of their Manners, occasioned
chiefly by their Ignorance, and want of
Correspondence with the politer Part of the
World, that they seem contented enough
with their plain Necessaries, and don't much
hanker after greater Matters, tho' their Country
in many Places is capable of great Improvements.</p>
          <p>In JOB's Country the Slaves, and poorer
sort of People, are employed in preparing the
Bread, Corn, &amp;c. And here they labour under a
great many Difficulties, having no proper
Instruments either for Tilling the Ground, or
reaping the Corn when it is ripe; insomuch that
they us'd, in Harvest-time, to pull it up, Roots
and all. To reduce their
<pb id="bluett36" n="36"/>
Corn to Flower, they rub it between two
Stones with their Hands, which must be
very tedious. Nor is their Fatigue in
Building and Carriage less, for they perform
the whole by mere Dint of Strength,
and downright Labour. The better Sort
of People, who apply themselves to Study
and Reading, are obliged to read whole
Nights together by the Light of the Fire,
(having no Candles or Lamps, as we
have) which must be very troublesome
in that hot, sultry Country. These, and
several other Difficulties which these
People labour under, we hope will be removed by 
JOB's Return; his Friends here
having suited their Presents very judiciously to the
Necessities of his Country-men;
and there is scarce any Tool or
Machine, that can be of real Use to them,
which JOB has not had from some Friend
or other, and their several Uses have
been shewn to him with a great deal of
Care.</p>
          <pb id="bluett37" n="37"/>
          <p>Some of those People spend a great
Part of their Time in Hunting; particularly after the
Elephants, with whose
Teeth they drive a great Trade. One
of those Hunters affirmed to JOB, that
he had seen an Elephant <sic corr="surprise">surprize</sic> a Lion
(to which Beast, it seems, the Elephant
bears a very great Hatred) and carry him
to a Tree, which he split down, and
putting the Lion's Head thro', let the
Tree close again on the Lion's Neck, and
there left him to perish. JOB did not say
that he knew this Fact to be true; but
it seems to be the more probable, upon
account of what he assured me he had
been a Witness to himself, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> that an
Elephant having catch'd a Lion, carried
him directly to a great Slough, and
thrusting the Lion's Head under the Mud,
held him there till he was smothered.</p>
          <p>One Day JOB finding a Cow of his
Father's, that had been killed, and partly
<pb id="bluett38" n="38"/>
devoured, resolved, if possible, to <sic corr="surprise">surprize</sic> the
Devourer. Accordingly he placed himself in a
Tree, near the Remains of the Cow; and, in the
Close of the Evening, he saw two Lions making
up to it with great Caution, moving slow, and
looking carefully about them. At last one came
up, which JOB shot with a poisoned Arrow,
and wounded so deadly that he fell immediately
upon the Spot; the other coming up soon after,
JOB shot another Arrow, and wounded him;
upon which he roared out and fled, but the next
Morning was found dead about 300 Yards
from the Place.</p>
          <p>The Poison they dip their Arrows in, is the
juice of a certain Tree; and is of such a Nature,
that it infects the Blood in a short Time, and
makes the Creature quite stupid and senseless.
Altho' it is so deadly a Poison, it does not hinder
their eating the Flesh of the Animal that is shot;
for as soon as it is stupified enough
<pb id="bluett39" n="39"/>
to drop down, they catch it, cut its Throat, &amp;c. as their Law directs, and then eat it. If a Man is
wounded with one of these Arrows, they have
an Herb, which, if immediately apply'd is a sure
Remedy, and extracts the Poison.</p>
          <p>And here I would observe two Things, as well
from my own Observations abroad, as from
what I have just mentioned. First, that in all
Countries, where these wild Beasts are, at least
where I have been, Providence has so ordered
it, that they will all fly at the Sight of a Man, and
will never attack him, if they have any room to
escape by Flight. Secondly, that all Poisons, of
what Nature soever, have their Antidotes
generally near them. One Instance of which I
shall mention, as being somewhat extraordinary.</p>
          <p>The Milk, or Liquor that is squeezed from the
<hi rend="italics">Caffavi</hi>, or Caffader Roots (of which Roots is
made the Bread of that
<pb id="bluett40" n="40"/>
Name, used in <hi rend="italics">Barbadoes</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Jamaica</hi>,
all the Leward, <hi rend="italics">Caribbe</hi> Islands) is so
deadly a Poison, that one Pint of it will
soon kill any Creature that drinks it. Yet
I knew a Cow, which drank a hearty
Draught of it, and immediately (as if
sensible of the Danger she was in) went
and fed on a Shrub, which grows common
there, called the <hi rend="italics">sensible Plant</hi>, from
the shrivelling up of its Leaves upon the
least Touch; and altho' we expected
every Minute to see her fall down dead,
it so expelled the Poison, that the received
not she least Hurt by it.</p>
          <p>The Manner of their Marriages and
Baptisms is something remarkable. When
a Man has a mind to marry his Son
(which they generally do much sooner
than in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>) and has found out a
suitable Match for him, he goes to the
Girl's Father, proposes the Matter to
him, and agrees for the Price that he is
to pay for her; which the Father of the
<pb id="bluett41" n="41"/>
Woman always gives to her as a Dowry. All
Things being concluded on, the two Fathers and
the young Man go to the Priest, and declare
their Agreement; which finishes the Marriage.
But now comes the great Difficulty, <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi> how the
Young Man shall get his Wife home; for the
Women, Cousins, and Relations, take on
mightily, and guard the Door of the House, to
prevent her being carried away; but at last the
young Man's Presents and Generosity to them,
makes them abate their Grief. He then provides
a Friend, well mounted, to carry her off; but as
soon as she is up on Horseback, the Women
renew their Lamentations, and rush in to
dismount her. However, the Man is generally
successful, and rides off with his Prize to the
House provided for her. After this they make a
Treat for their Friends, but the Woman never
appears at it; and tho' the Ladies here in
<hi rend="italics">England</hi> are generally more free after Marriage
than before, with the Women in
<pb id="bluett42" n="42"/>
JOB's Country it is quite contrary; for they are so
very bashful, that they will never permit their
Husbands to see them without a <sic corr="Veil">Vail</sic> on for
three Years after they are married; insomuch,
that altho' JOB has a Daughter by his last
Wife, yet he never saw her unveiled since Marriage,
having been married to her but about two
Years before he came from home. To prevent
Quarrels, and keep Peace among their Wives,
the Husbands divide their Time equally betwixt
them; and are so exact in this Affair, that if one
Wife lies in, the Husband lies alone in her
Apartment those Nights, that are her Turn, and
not with the other Wife. If a Wife proves very
bad, they put her away, and she keeps her
Dowry, and any one may marry her after her
Divorce; but they don't use to put them away
upon slight Occasions. If a Woman puts away
her Husband, she must return him her Dowry;
and she is look'd upon always after as a
scandalous Person, no Man
<pb id="bluett43" n="43"/>
caring to have any thing to do with her.</p>
          <p>All their Male Children are circumcised; but,
besides, they have a kind of Baptism for all
Children, of both Sexes. When the Child is
seven Days old, the People that are invited meet
together at the Father's House; the Father
names the Child, and the Priest writes the Name
of the Child on a piece of smooth Board. Then
the Father kills a Cow or Sheep, according to
his Ability; part of which is dress'd for the
Company, and the rest distributed amongst the
Poor: After which the Child is wash'd all over
with fair Water, and then the Priest writes the
Child's Name on Paper, which is rolled up, and
tied about the Child's Neck; where it remains, till
it is wore or rubb'd off.</p>
          <p>The Ceremony at their Burials has nothing
remarkable in it. They put the
<pb id="bluett44" n="44"/>
dead Body in the Earth, and cover it up as we
do in <hi rend="italics">England</hi>, saying some Prayers over it,
which JOB told me were intended only for the
Benefit of the Bystanders, and not of the dead
Person; for they are not of opinion that the
Dead can reap any Advantage by their
Devotion at that Time.</p>
          <p>Their Opinions and Traditions, in Matters of
Religion, are much the same with those of the
Generality of the <hi rend="italics">Mahometans</hi>; tho' the learned Sort
of them give a more plausible and refined Turn to
the gross and sensual Doctrines of the <hi rend="italics">Koran</hi>, than
those in <hi rend="italics">Turkey</hi>, and some other Places. They
have a strong Aversion to the least Appearance
of Idolatry, insomuch that they will not keep a
Picture of any kind whatsoever in their Houses;
and the Popish Worship, at the <hi rend="italics">French</hi> Factory
in their Neighbourhood, has much confirmed
them in an Opinion that all Christians are
Idolaters. But I
<pb id="bluett45" n="45"/>
shall not say any more here upon this Head,
since their Religion, and the Ceremonies relating
to it, are pretty well known.</p>
          <p>I might add several other Particulars,
concerning their Dress, their Houses,
Oeconomy, and the like; but these too being
described at large in several Books already
published, I shall make an End of this Section,
and so pass on.</p>

          <argument>
            <p><hi rend="italics">Of</hi> JOB'<hi rend="italics">s</hi> Person <hi rend="italics">and</hi> Character.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>J<hi rend="italics">OB</hi> was about five Feet ten Inches
high, strait limb'd, and naturally of a good
Constitution; altho' the religious Abstinence
which he observed, and the Fatigues he lately
underwent, made him appear something lean
and weakly. His Countenance was exceeding
pleasant, yet grave and composed; his Hair
long, black, and curled, being very different
from that of the Negroes commonly brought
from <hi rend="italics">Africa</hi>.</p>
          <p>His natural Parts were remarkably good;
and I believe most of the Gentlemen that
conversed with him frequently, will remember
many Instances of his Ingenuity. On all
Occasions he discovered a solid judgment,
a ready Memory, and a clear Head.
And, notwithstanding the
Prejudices which it was natural for him
<pb id="bluett47" n="47"/>
to have in favour of his own religious Principles,
it was very observable with how much Temper
and Impartiality he would reason in
Conversation upon any Question of that kind,
while at the same Time he would frame such
Replies, as were calculated at once to support
his own Opinion, and to oblige or please his
Opponent. In his Reasonings there appeared
nothing trifling, nothing hypocritical or
over-strained; but, on the contrary, strong Sense,
joined with an innocent Simplicity, a strict
Regard to Truth, and a hearty Desire to find it.
Tho' it was a considerable Disadvantage to him
in Company, that he was not sufficient Master of
our Language; yet those who were used to his
Way, by making proper Allowances, always
found themselves agreeably entertained by him.</p>
          <p>The Acuteness of his Genius appear'd upon
many Occasions. He very readily conceived the
Mechanism and Use of most
<pb id="bluett48" n="48"/>
of the ordinary Instruments which were shewed
to him here; and particularly, upon seeing a
Plow, a Grist Mill, and a Clock taken to pieces,
he was able to put them together again himself,
without any farther Direction.</p>
          <p>His Memory was extraordinary; for when
he was fifteen Years old he could say the whole
<hi rend="italics">Alcoran</hi> by heart, and while he was here in
<hi rend="italics">England</hi> he wrote three Copies of it without the
Assistance of any other Copy, and without so
much as looking to one of those three when he
wrote the others. He would often laugh at me
when he heard me say I had forgot any Thing,
and told me he hardly ever forgot any Thing in
his Life, and wondered that any other body
should.</p>
          <p>In his natural Temper there appeared a happy
Mixture of the Grave and the <sic corr="Cheerful">Chearful</sic>, a gentle
Mildness, guarded by a proper Warmth, and a
kind and
<pb id="bluett49" n="49"/>
compassionate Disposition towards all that were in
Distress. In Conversation he was commonly very
pleasant; and would every now and then divert
the Company with some witty Turn, or pretty
Story, but never to the Prejudice of Religion, or
good Manners. I could perceive, by several slight
Occurrences, that, notwithstanding his usual
Mildness, he had Courage enough, when there
was occasion for it: And I remember a Story
which he told me of himself, that is some Proof of
it. As he was passing one Day thro' the Country
of the <hi rend="italics">Arabs</hi>, on his way home, with four
Servants, and several Negroes which he had
bought, he was attacked by fifteen of the wild
<hi rend="italics">Arabs</hi>, who are known to be common <hi rend="italics">Bandetti</hi>,
or Robbers in those Parts. JOB, upon the first
Sight of this Gang, prepared for a Defence; and
setting one of his Servants to watch the Negroes,
he, with the other three, stood on his Guard. In
the Fight one of JOB's Men was killed,
<pb id="bluett50" n="50"/>
and JOB himself was run thro' the Leg with a
Spear. However, having killed two of the
<hi rend="italics">Arabs</hi>, together with their Captain and two
Horses, the rest fled, and JOB brought off his
Negroes safe.</p>
          <p>JOB's Aversion to Pictures of all Sorts, was
exceeding great; insomuch, that it was with
great Difficulty that he could be brought to sit for
his own. We assured him that we never
worshipped any Picture, and that we wanted his
for no other End but to keep us in mind of him.
He at last consented to have it drawn; which
was done by Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hoare</hi>. When the Face was
finished, Mr. <hi rend="italics">Hoare</hi> ask'd what Dress would be
most proper to draw him in; and, upon JOB's
desiring to be drawn in his own Country Dress,
told him he could not draw it, unless he had
seen it, or had it described to him by one who
had: Upon which JOB answered, If you can't
draw a Dress you never saw, why do some of
you Painters presume to
<pb id="bluett51" n="51"/>
draw God, whom no one ever saw?
I might mention several more of
his smart Repartees in Company, which shewed
him to be a Man of Wit and Humour, as well as
good Sense: But that I may not be tedious,
what I have said shall suffice for this Head.</p>
          <p>As to his Religion, 'tis known he was a
<hi rend="italics">Mahometan</hi>, but more moderate in his
Sentiments than most of that Religion are. He did
not believe a sensual Paradise, nor many other
ridiculous and vain Traditions, which pass
current among the Generality of the <hi rend="italics">Turks</hi>. He
was very constant in his Devotion to God; but
said, he never pray'd to <hi rend="italics">Mahommed</hi>, nor did he
think it lawful to address any but God himself in
Prayer. He was so fixed in the Belief of one
God, that it was not possible, at least during the
Time he was here, to give him any Notion of the
Trinity; so that having had a New Testament
given him in his own
<pb id="bluett52" n="52"/>
Language, when he had read it, he told me he had
perused it with a great deal of Care, but could
not find one Word in it of three Gods, as some
People talk: I did not care to puzzle him, and
therefore answered in general, that the <hi rend="italics">English</hi>
believed only in one God. He shewed upon all
Occasions a singular Veneration for the Name of
God, and never pronounced the Word <hi rend="italics">Allah</hi>
without a peculiar Accent, and a remarkable
Pause: And indeed his Notions of God,
Providence, and a future State, were in the main
very just and reasonable.</p>
          <p>His Learning, considering the Disadvantages
of the Place he came from, was far from being
contemptible. The Books in his Country are all
in Manuscript, all upon Religion; and are not, as
I remember, more than Thirty in Number. They
are all in <hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi>; but the <hi rend="italics">Alcoran</hi>, he says,
was originally wrote by God himself, not in
<hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi>, and God sent it by
<pb id="bluett53" n="53"/>
the Angel <hi rend="italics">Gabriel</hi> to <hi rend="italics">Ababuker</hi>, some time
before <hi rend="italics">Mahommed</hi> was born; the Angel taught
<hi rend="italics">Ababuker</hi> to read it, and no one can read it but
those who are instructed after a different Manner
from that in which the <hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi> is commonly
taught. However, I am apt to think that the
Difference depends only upon the Pointing of the
<hi rend="italics">Arabick</hi>, which is of later Date. JOB was well
acquainted with the historical Part of our Bible,
and spoke very respectfully of the good Men
mentioned in Scripture; particularly of JESUS
CHRIST, who, he said, was a very
great Prophet, and would have done much
more Good in the World, if he had not been cut
off so soon by the wicked <hi rend="italics">Jews</hi>; which made it
necessary for God to send <hi rend="italics">Mahomet</hi> to confirm
and improve his Doctrine.</p>

          <head>CONCLUSION;</head>
          <head>Containing Some
<lb/>
REFLECTIONS upon the whole.</head>
          <p>One can't but take Notice of a very remarkable
Series of Providence, from the Beginning of
JOB's Captivity, till his Return to his own
Country. When we reflect upon the Occasion
and Manner of his being taken at first, and the
Variety of Incidents during his Slavery, which,
from slight and unlikely Beginnings, gradually
brought about his Redemption, together with the
singular Kindness he met with in this Country
after he was ransomed, and the valuable
Presents which he carried over with him; I say,
when all these Things are duly considered, if we
believe that the wise Providence of the great
Author of Nature governs the World, 'tis natural for
<pb id="bluett55" n="55"/>
us to conclude that this Process, in the divine
Oeconomy of Things, is not for nought, but that
there is some important End to be served by it.</p>
          <p>Our own imperfect Observations 
have discovered to us innumerable Instances of
Design and Contrivance in the natural World;
and tho' we cannot assign the immediate Causes
and Ends of all the Phenomena of Nature, yet
we know enough of them to convince us that the same
uniform Design, the same wife and beautiful
Order is carried on and maintained throughout
the whole. And as there is a manifest Analogy between
the Methods of Government in the natural and
moral Worlds, so that they seem to be but as
different Acts of the same grand Drama; and
since the Providence of God is no less certain
than his Existence, Chance being as unable to
govern a World as to make one; we may safely,
and on good Grounds infer, that the various
<pb id="bluett56" n="56"/>
Occurrences in human Life, however
inconsiderable or perplex'd they may appear to
us, are neither beneath the Care, nor inextricable
to the Wisdom of him who rules the Universe:
No; they have all their proper Places in the great
Scheme; and all conspire in a regular Gradation,
to bring about their several Ends, in
Subserviency to the whole.</p>
          <p>'Tis true, neither the Extent of our Lives nor
Capacities will permit us to view any very great
Part of the Works of God; and what we do
see, we are too apt to put a wrong Construction
upon, being unacquainted in a great measure
with the secret Springs of Nature, and
altogether unable to take in the vast Projects of
infinite Wisdom: But the particular Scenes that
we are sometime presented with, appear so full
of deep Design, and are executed with such
divine Art, that they cannot but strike the sober
Part of Mankind with Impressions of the
<pb id="bluett57" n="57"/>
highest Wonder, and loudly call for the
Attention of a reasonable Being.</p>
          <p>History, and our own Experience, furnish us
with several amazing Instances of the Conduct of
Providence, as well as Nature; which, tho' they
cannot be fully or equally accounted for by us,
yet may be improved by a well-disposed Mind
to very good Purposes; as they serve to increase
the high Veneration which we all ought to have
for the supreme Lord and Governor of the
World, and naturally suggest to us our
<sic corr="Dependence">Dependance</sic> upon him; as they tend to confirm
our Belief of a Providence, and encourage us to
trust our selves <sic corr="entirely">intirely</sic> in the Hands of our
Maker, which is the great Support of every
good Man amidst the Calamities of this
present Life. In short, as it is very happy for us
that the Direction of all Events belongs to God;
so we ought to take all Opportunities to excite
and strengthen in our selves, and others, a
<pb id="bluett58" n="58"/>
due Sense of his Government, a becoming
Regard to his Works, and just Sentiments of
the Relation which we bear to him.</p>
          <p>With some such Reflections as these
JOB used to comfort himself in his
Captivity; and upon proper Occasions, in
Conversation, would speak very justly and
devoutly of the Care of God over his Creatures,
and particularly of the remarkable Changes of
his own Circumstances; all which he piously
ascribed to an unseen Hand. He frequently
compared himself to <hi rend="italics">Joseph</hi>; and when he
was informed that the King of <hi rend="italics">Futa</hi> had killed a
great many of the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi> upon his
Account, he said, with a good deal of Concern,
if he had been there he would have prevented it;
for it was not the <hi rend="italics">Mandingoes</hi>, but God, who
brought him into a strange Land.</p>
          <pb id="bluett59" n="59"/>
          <p>It would be Presumption in us to affirm
positively what God is about to do at any Time;
but may we not be allowed humbly to hope that
one End of JOB's Captivity, and happy
Deliverance, was the Benefit and Improvement
of himself and his People? His Knowledge is
now extended to a Degree which he could never
have arrived at in his own Country; and the
Instruments which he carried over, are well
adjusted to the Exigencies of his Countrymen.
Who can tell, but that thro' him a whole Nation
may be made happy? The Figure which he
makes in those Parts, as Presumptive High-priest,
and the Interest which he has with the
King of the Country, considering the singular
Obligations he is under to the <hi rend="italics">English</hi>, may possibly, in
good time, be of considerable Service to us
also; and we have reason to hope this, from the
repeated Assurances we had from JOB, that he
would, upon all
<pb id="bluett60" n="60"/>
Occasions, use his best Endeavours to promote
the <hi rend="italics">English</hi> Trade before any other.
But whatever be the Consequences, we
cannot but please our selves with the Thoughts
of having acted so good and generous a Part to
a distressed Stranger. And as this gives me
occasion to recommend Hospitality, I cannot
conclude, without saying something in favour 
of it.</p>
          <p>Among the various Branches of Friendship
and Beneficence, there is none of a more noble
and disinterested Nature, or that tends more
directly to the Union, and consequently the
Subsistence of the human Species, than that of
Hospitality and Kindness to Strangers. In many
Instances of private Friendship, we are apt to be
guided by our own private Interest; and very
often the Exchange of good Offices among
Friends, is little better than mere Barter, where
an Equivalent is expected on both Sides. In
most Acts
<pb id="bluett61" n="61"/>
of Charity and Compassion too, we may
be, and very often are wrought upon by
the undue Influence of some selfish View,
and thereby we destroy in good measure
the Merit of them: But in shewing Pity
to Strangers, as such, and kindly
relieving them in their Distress, there is
not such Danger of being influenced by
private Regards; nor is it likely that we are so. Here we
act for God's sake, and for the sake of human
Nature; and we seem to have no Inducement
superior to the Will of Heaven, and the
Pleasure that results from the Consciousness of
a generous Respect for our common Humanity.</p>
          <p>There is something singularly sublime, and
even God-like, in this benevolent Disposition
towards Strangers. The common Parent of the
Universe pours out his Blessings daily upon all
Mankind, in all Places of the Earth;
<pb id="bluett62" n="62"/>
the Just and the Unjust, the Rich and the Poor,
all the Classes, all the Families of human
Creatures, subsist by his Bounty, and have their
Share of his universal Favours. The good
hospitable Man, in his low Sphere, imitates his Maker,
and deals about him to his Fellow Mortals with great
Chearfulness. He considers his Species in one
complex View, and wishes that his Abilities were
as extensive as his Inclinations. He does not
confine his Benevolence to his Relations, or any
particular Party of Men; his Affections are too
warm, too general to be thus circumscribed;
they must range round the whole Globe, and
exert themselves in all Places, where an
Opportunity offers.</p>
          <p>Such a happy Temper of Mind appeared
eminently in those worthy Gentlemen that
promoted and encouraged a Subscription for
the Relief of JOB;
<pb id="bluett63" n="63"/>
and we hope there are many such Instances of
Hospitality among us, which is one very
honourable Part of the Character of the
<hi rend="italics">English</hi>.</p>
