        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>THE extradition of Anthony Burns as a fugitive slave
was the most memorable case of the kind that has occurred
since the adoption of the Federal Constitution. It was
memorable for the place and for the time of its occurrence;
the place being the ancient and chief seat of Liberty in
America, and the time being just the moment when the
cause of Liberty bad received a most wicked and crushing
blow from the hand of the Federal Government. It was
memorable also for the difficulty with which it was
accomplished, for the intense popular excitement which it
caused, for the unexampled expense which it entailed, for the
grave questions of law which it involved, for the punishment
which it brought down upon the head of the chief actor, and for
the political revolution which it drew on. Viewing it thus, it
seemed to me to merit an elaborate record; and as unusual
facilities were furnished me, I ventured upon the task.</p>
        <p>My materials have been derived chiefly from original
sources. Of much that is narrated, I was myself an eye-witness.
I was present at the Faneuil Hall meeting from its
commencement to its close, and I witnessed the attack
<pb id="stevevi" n="vi"/>
on the Court House. Throughout the trial of Burns, save a short
interval, I had a seat within the bar, and carefully observed the
arrangements made by the Marshal, and the demeanor of the
various parties. While the troops were drawn up on the
Common, on the second of June, I passed up and down the
lines, and took note of their conduct. Afterward, on the same
day, I traversed that section of the city from which the citizens
were excluded by force of martial law, and noticed the manner in
which the troops and the police were disposed for the purpose
of guarding the streets and avenues. Finally, I stood upon the
steps of the Custom House, when the Marshal with his posse
and prisoner passed on his way to the wharf, and witnessed the
assault of the soldiers, with sabres and bayonets, on the
defenceless and unoffending multitude.</p>
        <p>The account of the early life of Burns, of his arrest, of his
voyage back to Virginia, of his imprisonment, and of
his sojourn in North Carolina, was taken down by me from his
own lips, soon after his return to Boston. For placing full
confidence in his statements, the reader has the warrant of his
former master, Col. Suttle, who, after his return to Alexandria,
bore testimony to the truthfulness and honesty of Burns in a
letter which is now first printed in this volume. I may add that
he has no less warrant from all who have known Burns.</p>
        <p>The true history of the transactions respecting the Writ of
Replevin is here for the first time made public. It is drawn
chiefly from a correspondence (still in manuscript)
<pb id="stevevii" n="vii"/>
which passed between Governor Washburn and the Hon.
Samuel E. Sewall, shortly after the rendition of Burns. For the
use of this correspondence I am indebted to the courtesy of
Governor Washburn. Some additional facts have been derived
from the officer who was charged with the service of the writ.</p>
        <p>The Rev. L. A. Grimes bore a large share in the transactions
here narrated, and I have relied chiefly upon his authority in
recounting such matters as came within his personal
cognizance. This remark is likewise applicable to Mr. Joseph
K. Hayes, who was a captain of the Boston police until the
second of June, and acted a conspicuous part on that day. My
acknowledgments are also due to Richard H. Dana, Jr., Esq.,
and Charles M. Ellis, Esq., for important documents, and for
information besides.</p>
        <p>The account of the evidence and the arguments on the
examination, is abridged from the reports published at the time.
The chapter relating to the trial of the Commissioner is based
on facts of public notoriety, on documents published by
authority of the General Court of Massachusetts, and on the
original records of that body deposited in the State House.</p>
        <p>The Appendix contains various authentic documents which
are authority for certain statements in the narrative, and are
otherwise illustrative of the subject. Among them are copies of
letters written by District Attorney Hallett and Marshal
Freeman, and on file in the office of the clerk of the Courts, at
Dedham.</p>
        <pb id="steveviii" n="viii"/>
        <p>The Illustrations are from drawings made on the spot, by an
artist who was an eye-witness of the principal scene.
Adequately to depict that scene—presenting to view, as it did,
tens of thousands of spectators—was impossible on a page of
this size; but the picture here given will greatly assist the reader
in forming a distinct conception of it. The edifices introduced
into the sketches will be readily identified.</p>
        <p>At the beginning of the volume will be found a transcript
from the ancient Records of Massachusetts. The contrast
between the transaction therein recorded and that presented in
this narrative, will suggest its own impressive lesson.
Immediately following, is a declaration of the <hi rend="italics">Higher Law</hi> in the
incomparable sentences of the great Roman Orator and Moral
Philosopher.</p>
        <p>As I write these lines, the country is passing through its
greatest crisis of peril. On the western frontier, civil war is
flagrant. At Washington, a Senator lies wounded and disabled,
having been stealthily stricken down on the floor of the Senate,
for words spoken in debate, by a member of the House from
South Carolina. The whole South, with trifling exceptions,
applauds this assault upon the representative of a sovereign
State. A National Convention of the party in power has just
given its sanction to the policy of which these events, as well
as the extradition of Burns, are the legitimate fruits, and has
<pb id="steveix" n="ix"/>
nominated for the Presidency a person who has pledged
himself fully to enforce that policy. Should that person be
elected, and that policy be enforced, the cause of Freedom,
whether in Kansas, in Washington, or in Massachusetts, would
have just reason to apprehend a repetition of similar assaults
from the slave power. To avert such a calamity every good
citizen must labor; and I hope. that this History, conceived and
executed for a more general purpose, may contribute
somewhat also to that, particular end.</p>

          <head>THE ARREST.</head>
          <p>IN the evening of the twenty-fourth of May, 1854,
Anthony Burns was arrested as a fugitive slave in the
heart of Boston. He had been employed, during the day,
in a clothing store situated in Brattle street, and
belonging to Coffin Pitts, a respectable colored trader.
The locality was peculiarly suggestive of liberty and
human rights. In full view, at the distance of only three
or four rods, stands Brattle street Church, imbedded in
the front face of which is a cannon-ball, preserved as a
sacred memento of the Siege of Boston. A little farther
off, but also in full view, stands Faneuil Hall. The street
itself, an ancient one, perpetuates the name of one of
the most enlightened friends of liberty that in the early
days assisted in building up the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts. In this favored locality Burns had
passed exactly one month of quiet freedom, spent in
honest industry, when the sudden interruption of his
happiness took place.</p>
          <pb id="steve16" n="16"/>
          <p>The arrest was made under a warrant issued on the same
day, by Edward G. Loring, a United States Commissioner.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">1</ref><note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixa">Appendix A</ref>.</note>
The person charged with its immediate execution was a man
who had already become infamous by making the hunting
of fugitive slaves his special vocation. The name of this
man was Asa O. Butman. He had been observed in the store
of Mr. Pitts during the day; but, although he was seen more
than once to fix his eye upon Burns, no suspicion had been
excited by his appearance. Not dreaming of danger, Burns
kept about his business until the hour of closing the shop
arrived, when he locked the door and departed. It had been
his constant custom to accompany his employer, with
whom he boarded, directly home; but on the evening in
question he took it into his head, from mere caprice, to stroll
down the street in an opposite direction. Mr. Pitts
meanwhile pursued his way homeward. After going on
aimlessly for a few rods, Burns retraced his steps, intending
to overtake his employer, who, at that moment, was
disappearing round the corner of Brattle and Court streets.
Apprehending nothing, he went leisurely along until, just
as he had reached the comer of Hanover and Court streets,
a hand was roughly laid on his shoulder, and an
exclamation of, “Stop, old boy!” arrested his steps. On
turning, he found himself in the grasp of Butman. Still
unsuspicious of the real state of the case, and supposing
that he had
<pb id="steve17" n="17"/>
been beset only by a street brawler, he demanded to
know why he was detained. Butman informed him that
he was arrested on a charge of having broken into and
robbed a jewelry-store. Conscious of innocence, and
feeling assured that he could easily clear himself of the charge,
Burns made no resistance, and did not even alarm his employer,
who was then only two or three rods in advance. The spot
where the arrest was made, was hard by Peter B. Brigham's
drinking-saloon, the most noted establishment of the kind
in Boston. From that, or from some other lurking-place in
the vicinity, six or seven men immediately rushed forth to
the assistance of the officer. Encircling the prisoner,
they in a moment had him off his feet, took him in their
arms horizontally as they would a dead person, and, avoiding
the side-walk, rapidly bore him down the middle of the street
to the Court House. At the entrance, they were received by
the United States Marshal, who stood with a drawn sword
upon the outer steps, manifestly awaiting their appearance.
Without pause, or being set down upon his feet, the prisoner
was hurried up several flights of stairs to the United States
jury-room, near the top of the building. He had been informed,
on being arrested, that he was to be conducted into the
presence of the person whom he was accused of robbing.
Finding no such person present, he now demanded to
know why the <sic>jeweller</sic> did not come. Butman and his
<pb id="steve18" n="18"/>
associates professed wonder at his non-appearance. The
delay continued. Suddenly, the truth flashed upon the
unhappy prisoner—he was an arrested fugitive slave!
Then, with the quickness of thought, the whole dismal
future opened up before his mental vision. As in a
dissolving view, the land of freedom faded out, and the
dark land of slavery usurped its place. He saw himself
again a slave ; far worse than that, a slave disgraced;
pointed at as a runaway; punished; perhaps punished
unto death. Overpowered by the prospect, he, in his own
simple but expressive phrase, “gave all up.” Fast confined
within granite walls, and closely guarded by eight armed
men, he saw the full hopelessness of his situation, and did
not for a moment indulge any thought of escape.</p>
          <p>Twenty minutes had elapsed, when the door was
thrown open, and the Marshal, accompanied by two men,
entered the room. The men were Charles F. Suttle, the
claimant of Burns, and his agent, William Brent;
Virginians both. Immediately stepping toward the
prisoner, Mr. Suttle, with mock politeness, took off his
hat, saluted the latter with a low bow, and said, with
emphasis on the appellation:</p>
          <p>“How do you do, <hi rend="italics">Mr.</hi> Burns?”</p>
          <p>The prisoner had no reply for this unseemly triumph
over his blasted hopes.</p>
          <p>“Why did you run away from me?” pursued Suttle.</p>
          <pb id="steve19" n="19"/>
          <p>“I fell asleep on board the vessel where I worked,
and, before I woke up, she set sail and carried me off.”</p>
          <p>“<sic corr="Haven't">Have n't</sic> I always treated you. well, Tony?”</p>
          <p>To this question Burns made no answer.</p>
          <p>“<sic corr="Haven't">Have n't</sic> I always given you money when you
needed?”</p>
          <p>“You have always given me twelve and a half-cents 
once a year.”</p>
          <p>Nothing further passed between the two, but in 
this brief colloquy Burns had already made admissions
decisive of his fate. While it was going on, Brent stood
gazing steadily in the prisoner's face, but exchanged no
words, not even salutations with him. The object of the
wily slaveholder had been accomplished, and with his
friend he now took his departure. As he passed out, the
Marshal put the inquiry, “Well, that's the man, is it?”
to which Suttle responded, “Yes.”</p>
          <p>No sooner had they gone, than the door was again
strongly barred, and Burns was left to pass the night
with the men by whom he had been arrested.
Recalling his thoughts from Suttle, he now turned with
indignant scorn upon Butman.</p>
          <p>“I thought,” said he, “you arrested me for <hi rend="italics">stealing.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“I was afraid of a mob,” replied the dastard,“and that
was the reason why I <sic corr="didn't">did n't</sic> arrest you when you left the
store.” He added that he had been standing on the
opposite side of the street, watching for Burns.</p>
          <pb id="steve20" n="20"/>
          <p>“If you had told me the truth, it <sic corr="wouldn't">would n't</sic> have been
so easy a job to arrest me,” said the stalwart slave. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">1</ref><note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">1 Burns was about six feet in height, broad chested, and
otherwise firmly built.</note></p>
          <p>“If you had resisted, I should have shot you down,”
was the retort of the slave-hunter.</p>
          <p>Butman rightly judged that a lie was necessary to the
success of his enterprise. Had Burns suspected the truth,
he might have been slain, but he would never have been
captured. His flashing eye and deepened tones, as well as
his words, gave assurance of this, as he spoke of the
subject afterward.</p>
          <p>Butman and his fellow catchpolls had no thought of putting
themselves to any personal discomfort. Belonging to a class
of men who are governed by their sensual appetites, they reckoned
upon riotous living at the expense of the Government as a part
of their reward. So infamous was the business put upon them,
and so few were the persons who would undertake it, that they
in a measure had the Government in their power, and
could make their own terms. Accordingly, no sooner were they
well housed for the night, with their prisoner, than various
choice viands, which had been ordered by them from a
neighboring refectory, were introduced into the apartment.
With these unwonted luxuries they at once proceeded to
gorge themselves, while Burns, who had tasted no food since
noon, was left to pass the night fasting.</p>
          <pb id="steve21" n="21"/>
          <p>Having finished their repast, they beguiled the
hours with card-playing. Tiring of this, they next
fell to entertaining Burns with talk about Sims, Of whom,
once a prisoner in the same room like himself, he now
heard for the first time. At last, having exhausted their
resources, they stretched themselves out in various
postures, and one after another sunk into sleep. As may
well be imagined, there was no sleep that night for Burns;
seated in his chair, statue-like, the hours flew by him,
unheeded, while his great calamity stood ever present
staring him in the face.</p>
          <p>With the next dawn, his keepers awoke to indulge their
appetites afresh, a liberal supply of intoxicating liquors
being, as before, an important item in their bill of fare.
Burns was now for the first time invited to join them,
in their refreshments, but he loathed food and declined
the invitation. His coarse and sensual jailers, unable
to comprehend what nature should have taught them,
imputed his refusal to obstinacy, and muttered that
“it was not worth while for him to make a d—d fool
of himself.”</p>
          <p>In a short time, Riley, the deputy marshal, entered the
room and ordered handcuffs to be brought; they were
procured by the ever ready Butman. With these Burns
was manacled, and in that condition was forthwith
conducted to the United States court-room on the floor
below. Suttle and Brent were already there; the Marshal
and ten or twelve persons in his interest were the only
<pb id="steve22" n="22"/>
others in the room. Burns was placed in the prisoner's
seat, opposite the judges' bench, where he remained
handcuffed, with Butman and one of his aids, armed with
revolvers, seated on each side of him. In a few minutes
after, Commissioner Loring entered the room, and the
proceedings in the case forthwith commenced.</p>
          <p>As yet, the public had received no hint of the arrest;
the morning papers of the city were dumb; apparently,
the affair had escaped the vigilance of the ubiquitous
reporters. It was the purpose and hope of all the parties
concerned to hasten the examination, and, if possible,
remove the prisoner beyond reach before any rumor of
their proceedings should get abroad. Unfortunately for
the success of their design, Richard H. Dana, Jr.,
happened to pass the Court House just before nine
o'clock, the hour set for the examination, and received an
intimation of what was going on within. He immediately
turned his steps and entered the courtroom. Making his
way through some opposition to the side of Burns, he
offered the latter his professional services. The prisoner
declined them. “It will be of no use,” he said; “they
have got me.” He added, that, if he protracted the matter
by making a defence, it would be worse for him after
getting back to Virginia. The humane lawyer reasoned the
matter with him; the case, he said, depended on certain
papers and records in which some flaw might be
detected. Even the men who guarded him, betrayed, for
the moment, into a better
<pb id="steve23" n="23"/>
impulse by his aspect of despair, joined in urging
him to make a defence.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">1</ref><note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">1 See Mr. Dana's testimony before the committee of the
legislature on the subject of removing Mr. Loring from the
office of Judge of Probate. He adds: “I have heard that Burns
said that afterward some of the officers advised him
differently, and tried to make him suspect us.” Mr. Parker's
testimony on this point before the same committee was this:
“One of the ruffians that guarded him said, ‘You may ask
him as many times as you have a mind to; you will never
get him to have counsel or make any defence.’ The other 
an who guarded him on the other side said, ‘Well, Mr.
Parker, it will do no harm to try, and I hope he will.’ ”</note> Others, also, including
Charles M. Ellis and Theodore Parker, who had
before this time entered the room, attempted, but
without success, to persuade him to make a stand.</p>
          <p>The Commissioner making his appearance at this juncture
as before stated, Mr. Dana at once went up and spoke to
him privately. Burns, he said, was paralyzed with fear,
and in a condition wholly unfit to act for himself.
He suggested that the Commissioner should endeavor
to ascertain the real wishes of Burns in the matter; and
that for this purpose he should call the prisoner to the
bench, instead of addressing him while in the dock,
with Suttle sitting between them, as he was, and
gazing into the prisoner's face. “I intend to do
so,” replied the Commissioner.</p>
          <p>The examination now proceeded. The counsel for
the claimant read the warrant for the arrest, with the
officer's return upon it, and presented the record from
the Virginia, court required by the fugitive slave act.
Brent was then put upon the
<pb id="steve24" n="24"/>
stand as a witness to prove the identity of the prisoner
with the person named in the warrant. His testimony was
received without interruption, until he was asked to state
the admissions made by Burns to Suttle while in custody
the night before. At this point Mr. Dana interposed. He
had remained quiet thus far, supposing that, after the
claimant had made out his case, the Commissioner
intended to redeem his pledge by calling Burns to the
bench and ascertaining if he desired to make a defence.
But he now saw that the prisoner should at once have
counsel to object to the introduction of improper
testimony. Accordingly he rose, and, addressing the
court as <foreign rend="italics"><hi rend="italics">amicus curiae</hi></foreign>, urged the propriety of delay. The
motion was resisted by the claimant's counsel. Burns, it
was said, had admitted that he was Suttle's slave, and did
not desire a defence; and it was broadly hinted that the
only object of those who sought delay was for public
purposes of their own. Disdaining to reply to this charge,
Mr. Dana continued to press his point with great
earnestness. He was followed by Mr. Ellis, who also
addressed the court as amicus curiae. </p>
          <p>At the conclusion of these addresses, the Commissioner
directed the officer to bring Burns to him. This was
done, after the manacles were covertly removed from his
hands. The Commissioner then addressed him in a kind
manner, told him what the claim was, inquired if he
wished to make a defence, and informed him that he
could have counsel if he
<pb id="steve25" n="25"/>
desired. Burns looked round the court-room timidly, and
made no reply.</p>
          <p>“Anthony,” said the Commissioner, “would you like
to go away and come back here and meet me to-morrow
or next day, and tell me what you want to do?”</p>
          <p>Mr. Dana watched him closely, but could not see
whether he indicated assent or dissent. The
Commissioner was also in doubt, but after a moment
said,</p>
          <p>“Anthony, I understand you to say you would?”</p>
          <p>“I should,” at length replied Burns.</p>
          <p>“Then it shall be so,” said the Commissioner, and the
prisoner was conducted back to his seat.</p>
          <p>The presence of Theodore Parker has been mentioned.
He afterward described his interview with Burns, and the
appearance of the latter, in the presence of Suttle. “As no
counsel had been assigned,” said he, “I conferred with
Burns. I told him I was a minister, and had been
appointed at a meeting of citizens, minister at large in
behalf of fugitive slaves, and asked him if he did not
want counsel. He said, ‘I shall have to go back. Mr.
Suttle knows me—Brent knows me. If I must go back, I
want to go back as easy as I can.’ ‘But surely,’ I said, ‘it
can do you no harm to make a defence.’ ‘Well,’ said
Burns, ‘You may do as you have a mind to about it.’ He
seemed to me to be stupefied with fear; and when he
talked with me, he kept looking at Suttle and Brent. His
eye wandered from me, as an insane man's eye wanders,
<pb id="steve26" n="26"/>
and fixed itself on Suttle. When Loring asked him
whether he would have counsel, his eye fluctuated from
Loring to Suttle, and back again to Loring, and when he
said, ‘Yes,’ he turned away from Suttle to do so.”</p>
          <p>The examination was adjourned until Saturday, the
twenty-seventh day of the month; and when the court
re-opened on that morning, a further adjournment till the
Monday following was ordered, on the ground of the
lateness of the hour when the prisoner's counsel had
been appointed. Meanwhile, Burns was again manacled
and taken back to the jury-room, where he remained,
under the constant surveillance of four armed keepers,
from Thursday until Monday. The interval was
industriously employed by these tools of the slaveholder
in the livery of the Federal Government, in attempts to
lead Burns into making admissions fatal to himself. All
the cunning of their base natures was called into play to
compass their end. They made the warmest professions
of friendship for him, and invoked the direst curses on
their souls if they did not make their professions good.
They plied him with questions which, quietly assuming
the fact that he was Suttle's slave, looked toward
information on unimportant points. Thus they inquired
whether Suttle “raised or bought him.” In this instance
Burns proved too shrewd for them, and told them to find
out some other way.</p>
          <p>Still pursuing their object, they sought to get him
committed in writing. On entering the jury-room
<pb id="steve27" n="27"/>
on Friday, Mr. Grimes, a clergyman of Boston,
found Burns in the act of dictating a letter to Suttle, and
one of his keepers acting as an amanuensis. Burns had
been persuaded to take this step by the artful suggestions
of the official. The people of Boston, this fellow said,
were laboring under the impression that Suttle had
been a hard master to Burns; this tended to irritate Suttle;
but if Burns would dictate a statement to the contrary,
it would cause his master to feel more kindly toward him.
Ascertaining these facts, Mr. Grimes administered so
stern a rebuke to the fellow that he stammered out an
apology, and promised to destroy the letter. Nothing,
however, was farther from his thoughts; and Burns, now
made aware that the letter was to be used as an instrument
against him, sought to get it into his possession. After
some delay, it was delivered into his hands for the purpose
of making some addition to it, and by him was immediately
destroyed.</p>
          <p>Following their natural bent, these servants of the
Federal Government invited their prisoner to join them in
gambling for money. His reply was, that he never played
cards. They professed to think it strange that he should
refuse; Sims, they said, had played with them and won a
number of dollars. They next urged him to entertain them
with negro melodies, and again cited the example of Sims
in support of their request. But Burns replied, with a
pathos that was wasted upon their hard natures,—“My
singing days are over. I
<pb id="steve28" n="28"/>
have now learned another song.” Beginning at length to
suspect the religious character of their prisoner, one of
them jeeringly requested Burns to pray for him. “I trust I
shall do that,” was the simple reply.</p>
          <p>Thus did Burns pass the hours of his imprisonment,
alternately the object of treacherous interrogations and
the sport of scoffers. Thus did officers of the Federal
Government, not content with the infamy attaching even
to the strict and decorous discharge of their function,
add thereto the ineffable meanness of seeking to inveigle
their prisoner into some unguarded act or expression,
with which they might hasten to the slaveholder, and
claim a reward.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <head>THE ATTACK ON THE COURT HOUSE.</head>
          <p>THE news of Burns's arrest quickly spread
through the city. It found the public mind in a very
different frame from what it had been in at the arrest of
Sims, three years before. Those who had been most
zealous, on that occasion, for the execution of the
fugitive slave act, now stood passive, or openly
expressed their indignation at this new attempt. No
immediate step was taken, however, except by an
association styled a Committee of Vigilance. This
association took its origin from the passage of the
fugitive slave act. Its sole object was to defeat, in all
cases, the execution of that hated statute. Thoroughly
organized under a written code of laws, with the
necessary officers and working committees arranged on
the principle of a subdivision of labor, with wealth and
professional talent at its command, actuated by the most
determined purpose and operating in secret, it was well
fitted to strike powerful blows for the accomplishment of
its object. The roll of its members displayed the most
diversified assemblage of characters, but this diversity
only secured its greater efficiency. The white and the
colored
<pb id="steve30" n="30"/>
race, freeborn sons of Massachusetts and fugitive slaves
from the South, here<sic corr="cooperated"> co-operated</sic> together. Among them
were men of fine culture, and of high social position; men
too of renown. Some of the rich men of Boston were
enrolled in this committee. A most important portion
consisted of members of the Suffolk Bar, by whose
counsels the committee were guided through the legal
perils of their undertaking. The treasury was bountifully
supplied by voluntary contributions. One gave of his
poverty what he could, while another subscribed his five
hundred dollars. The methods of operation were various.
Whatever tended to keep the victim from falling into the
grasp of the law, or to rescue him if <sic>haply</sic> he had already
fallen in, was legitimate to their purpose. If a fugitive slave
arrived in Boston, he was at once taken in charge. In case
there was no pursuit, he remained at ease; but otherwise,
he was dispatched at the expense of the Committee on his
way to Canada. Sometimes the officers of the law were
notified that a certain vessel with a fugitive slave on
board would arrive at the port of Boston on a day named;
but this Committee of Vigilance had also been notified,
and, while the officers were waiting on the wharf for the
vessel to come up, the agents of the Committee had taken
boat, boarded the ship far out in the harbor, withdrawn
the slave,—perhaps under a show of legal authority,—and
landed him at some solitary point on shore, where a
carriage was in waiting by which
<pb id="steve31" n="31"/>
he was placed beyond the reach of pursuit. Whenever a
slaveholder arrived in the city, he was watched and the
object of his visit inquired into. If he had come in the
pursuit of ordinary business, he was left alone, but the
slightest indication that he was in pursuit of a slave,
sufficed to place him under a surveillance that never
ceased while he remained in the city. On one occasion,
a female slave, while walking in the streets of Boston,
suddenly beheld her owner a short distance off,
approaching toward her. She turned and fled down another
street, notified some of the Committee of the apparition,
and the same night was removed from the city. The
slaveholder was traced to his hotel, and never lost sight of
afterwards. Night and day, his steps were dogged by
members of the Committee. When one had followed him
a certain length of time, he was passed over to another;
now it was a white man, and now a colored man, that,
like his shadow, pursued him wherever he went. It was
afterward ascertained that he had come to Boston in
pursuit of the very slave by whom he had been recognized,
but who had fortunately escaped recognition by him.</p>
          <p>By this Committee of Vigilance, the case of Burns was
now taken in hand. Early in the afternoon of the day
following his arrest, a full meeting for the purpose was
secretly convened. On the main point there was but one
voice; all agreed that, be the Commissioner's decision
what it might,
<pb id="steve32" n="32"/>
Burns should never be taken back to Virginia, if it were in
their power to prevent. But there were two opinions as to
the method by which they should proceed to effect their
purpose. One party counselled an attack on the Court
House, and a forcible rescue of the prisoner. The other
party were in favor of a less violent course. They
proposed to await the Commissioner's decision; then, if it
were adverse to the prisoner, they would crowd the
streets when he was brought forth, present an impassable
living barrier to the progress of the escort, and see to it
that, in the <hi rend="italics"><sic>melee</sic></hi> which would inevitably follow, Burns
made good his escape. Both plans were long and
vehemently debated, but, without arriving at any
decision, the meeting was adjourned till evening. At this
second session, the more peaceful method prevailed by a
very large majority. For the purpose of arousing the
popular feeling to the requisite pitch and also indicating
to the public the particular line of action which had been
chosen, it was at the same time decided to call a public
meeting in Faneuil Hall for the evening following. Another
step was, to detail a certain number of men to watch the
Court House, night and day, lest the prisoner should be
removed unawares. Some, in the excess of their
apprehensions, feared that the Commissioner might hold a
midnight session of his court, and send Burns back into
slavery under cover of darkness. For the convenience of
this watch, a wealthy member of
<pb id="steve33" n="33"/>
the association threw open the loft of his warehouse and
liberally furnished it with provisions.</p>
          <p>The advocates for an assault on the Court House,
though outvoted, were not to be beaten off from their
purpose. At the close of the evening meeting, a voice
loudly called upon all who were in favor of that mode of
action, to tarry after the rest had retired. Fifteen or twenty
persons responded to this call; but when it was proposed
that they should pledge themselves in writing to engage
with force and arms in the perilous enterprise, only seven
of the number had the courage to affix their signatures to
the agreement. Not dismayed by such severe sifting,
these seven still resolved to go forward; and the
following night—the night for the meeting in Faneuil
Hall—was fixed upon for the execution of their plan.</p>
          <p>On Friday morning, the call for that meeting appeared
in all the papers and was placarded throughout the city.
“To secure justice for a man claimed as a slave by a
Virginia kidnapper, and imprisoned in Boston Court
House, in defiance of the laws of Massachusetts”—thus
began the notice. “Shall he be plunged into the hell of
Virginia slavery by a Massachusetts Judge of 
Probate?”—was the more 
ominous interrogatory with which it
closed. By eight o'clock in the evening, the venerable
Hall was filled to overflowing. The assembly was called
to order by Samuel E. Sewall, a distinguished citizen of
Boston. George R. Russell, an ex-mayor of the
neighboring city of
<pb id="steve34" n="34"/>
Roxbury, was placed in the President's chair, while among
the Vice-Presidents were several gentlemen who had
been of the Governor's Council, together with Dr. Samuel
G. Howe, the distinguished philanthropist and historian
of the Greek Revolution. Dr. Henry I. Bowditch and
Robert Morris, the colored lawyer of Boston, filled the
post of Secretaries.</p>
          <p>The subject of the evening was introduced by the
President in language of sarcasm and irony. “I once
thought,” said he, “that a fugitive could never be taken
from Boston. I was mistaken! One has been taken from
among us, and another lies in peril of his liberty. The boast
of the slaveholder is, that he will catch his slaves under
the shadow of Bunker Hill. We have made compromises
until we find that compromise is concession, and
concession is degradation. The question has come at last,
whether the North will still consent to do what it is held
base to do at the south. When Henry Clay was asked
whether it was expected that northern men would catch
slaves for the slaveholders, he replied: ‘No! of course not!
We will never expect you to do what we hold it <hi rend="italics">base</hi> to
do.’ Now, the very men who had acquiesced with Mr.
Clay, demand of us that we catch their slaves. It seems
that the Constitution has nothing for us to do but to help
catch fugitive slaves! When we get Cuba and Mexico as
slave states, when the foreign slave trade is re-established
with all the appalling horrors of the Middle Passage,
<pb id="steve35" n="35"/>
and the Atlantic is again filled with the bodies of dead
Africans, then we may think it time to awaken to our
duty. God grant that we may do so soon! The time will
come when slavery will pass away, and our children shall
have only its hideous memory to make them wonder at
the deeds of their fathers. For one, I hope to die in a land
of liberty—in a land which no slave-hunter shall dare
pollute with his presence.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Howe presented a series of resolves that were
subsequently adopted by the assembly as the expression
of its sentiments. They embodied these epigrammatic
sentences: “The time has come to declare and to
demonstrate the fact that no slavehunter can carry his
prey from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”—“That
which is not just is not law, and that which is not law
ought not to be obeyed.”—“Resistance to tyrants is
obedience to God.”—“Nothing so well becomes Faneuil
Hall, as the most determined resistance to a bloody and
overshadowing despotism.”—“It is the will of God that
every man should be free; we will as God wills; God's will
be done.”—“No man's freedom is safe unless all men are
free.”</p>
          <p>One of the ex-councillors of state gave his voice for
“fighting.” John L. Swift, a young lawyer of fervid oratory,
next addressed the assembly. “Burns,” said he, “is in the
Court House. Is there any law to keep him there? If we
allow Marshal Freeman to carry away that man, then the
word, ‘Cowards,’ should be stamped upon our
<pb id="steve36" n="36"/>
foreheads. When we go from this Cradle of Liberty, let us
go to the tomb of liberty, the Court House. To-morrow,
Burns will have remained incarcerated there three days,
and I hope <sic corr="tomorrow">to-morrow</sic> to witness, in his release, the
resurrection of liberty.”</p>
          <p>There were two men in the Hall for whose words, more
than for those of all others, the assembly impatiently
waited. These were Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker.
Regarded by the public as the leaders of the present
enterprise, closely associated in spirit and purpose, and
eminent, both, for the power of speech, they yet differed
from each other in many particulars. Mr. Phillips belonged
to the aristocracy, so far as such a class may be supposed
to exist in this country. He had an ancestry to boast of;
his family name was interwoven with the history of the
Commonwealth; and some of those who had borne it had
filled high offices in the government. Mr. Parker, on the
other hand, was of more plebeian origin; he had been the
architect of his own fortunes, and was by far the most
distinguished person of his lineage. In religion, Mr.
Phillips was a Calvinist, and believed that the Holy
Scriptures were the inspired word of God; while Mr.
Parker, rejecting all creeds and disowned by all sects, held
the Bible to contain only the wisdom of fallible men, and
claimed for himself and for future sages the possible
power of improving thereon. Mr. Phillips was a lawyer, but
he seldom appeared in the courts; Mr.
<pb id="steve37" n="37"/>
Parker was a clergyman, and, though without a church
and eschewing the holy sacraments, preached constantly
to a large but shifting congregation. Mr. Phillips excelled
in oratory, Mr. Parker was a greater master of the pen.
The former studied men, the latter, books. Mr. Parker had
a wider reputation—Europe had heard of him; but those
who knew both would have forsaken him to hang upon
the lips of Mr. Phillips. Mr. Parker had secured his
triumph when he had uttered his speech; Mr. Phillips
found his chief satisfaction in the accomplishment of the
end at which his oratory was aimed. Mr. Phillips had the
garb and gait of a gentleman; Mr. Parker, as he moved
along with stumbling steps and prone looks, had the
aspect of a recluse student. In their physical
characteristics, they differed not less than in mental and
moral traits. Mr. Phillips was a person of commanding
height and elegant proportions; his features were cast in
the Roman mould, his head was rounded and balanced
almost to the ideal standard. A ruddy complexion, fair
hair, and eyes of sparkling blue, showed him to be of the
true Saxon race. Mr. Parker, on the contrary, was of
inferior stature and ungraceful form; he had the face of a
Diogenes, and his massive head, capacious of brain in
the frontal region, was not symmetrically developed. He
had an <sic corr="atrabilious">atrabiliar</sic> complexion, dark hair, and large, dark
eyes that looked forth from behind spectacles with a
steady, unwinking gaze.</p>
          <pb id="steve38" n="38"/>
          <p>The speeches of both, on the present occasion, were
so imperfectly reported that the public abroad had but a
faint conception of their power and effect. Mr. Phillips
was the first to speak.</p>
          <p>“The city government is on our side,” began the
orator; a storm of cheers greeted the announcement. “I
am glad,” continued he, “to hear the applause of that
sentiment. If the city police had been warned on the Sims
case, as they are now, not to lift a finger in behalf of the
kidnappers, under pain of instant dismissal, Thomas Sims
would have been here in Boston to-day. To-morrow is to
determine whether we are ready to do the duty they have
left us to do. There is now no law in Massachusetts, and
when law ceases, the people may act in their own
sovereignty. I am against squatter sovereignty in
Nebraska, and against kidnappers' sovereignty in Boston.
See to it, that tomorrow, in the streets of Boston, you
ratify the verdict of Faneuil Hall, that Anthony Burns has
no master but his God.</p>
          <p>“The question is to be settled <sic corr="tomorrow">to-morrow</sic>, whether we
shall adhere to the case of Shadrach or the case of Sims.
Will you adhere to the case of Sims, and see this man
carried down State Street, between two hundred men? I
have been talking seventeen years about slavery, and it
seems to me I have talked to little purpose, for within
three years, two slaves can be carried away from Boston.
Nebraska, I call knocking a man down, and this is spitting
in his face after he is down. When
<pb id="steve39" n="39"/>
I heard of this case, and that Burns was locked up in that
Court House, my heart sank within me.</p>
          <p>“See to it, every one of you, as you love the honor of
Boston, that you watch this case so closely that you can
look into that man's eyes. When he comes up for trial,
get a sight at him, and don't lose sight of him. There is
nothing like the mute eloquence of a suffering man to
urge to duty; be there, and I will trust the result. If Boston
streets are to be so often desecrated by the sight of
returning fugitives, let us be there, that we may tell our
children we saw it done. There is now no use for Faneuil
Hall. Faneuil Hall is the purlieus of the Court House
<sic corr="tomorrow">to-morrow</sic> morning, where the children of Adams and
Hancock may prove that they are not bastards. Let us
prove that we are worthy of liberty.”</p>
          <p>Theodore Parker followed his coadjutor. Addressing
the assembly as “fellow subjects of Virginia,” he poured
forth a torrent of the most bitter invective. At the close,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">1</ref><note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixm">Appendix M.</ref></note>
he proposed that when the meeting adjourned, it should
be to meet in Court Square, the following morning, at
nine o'clock. “To-night,” shouted a hundred voices in
reply. The speaker stood silent, as one in doubt. At
length he called on those who were in favor of
proceeding that night to the Square, to raise their hands:
half the assembly did so. But now the excitement burst
through all bounds,—the vast Hall was filled with one
wild roar of voices. “To
<pb id="steve40" n="40"/>
the Court House,” was shouted in one quarter; “to the
Revere House for the slave-catchers,” was answered back
from another. In vain Mr. Parker attempted to allay the
tumult,—his voice was submerged in the billows of
sound, and he stood gesticulating like one in a dumb
show. A potent master of the weapons that are fitted to
goad the public mind even to madness, he lacked the
sovereign power to control and subdue at will large
masses of men. Amid the uproar, Wendell Phillips again
ascended the platform. The different quality of the two
men then appeared. Ere half a dozen sentences had fallen
from his lips, the assembly had subsided into profound
stillness.</p>
          <p>“Let us remember,” said he, “where we are and what
we are going to do. You have said, to-night, you will
vindicate the fair fame of Boston. Let me tell you, you
won't do it by groaning at the slave-catchers at the
Revere House—by attempting the impossible act of
insulting a slave-catcher. If there is a man here who has
an arm and a heart ready to sacrifice anything for the
freedom of an oppressed man, let him do it <sic corr="tomrrow">to-morrow</sic>. If I
thought it would be done to-night, I would go first. I don't
profess courage, but I do profess this: when there is a
possibility of saving a slave from the hands of those who
are called officers of the law, I am ready to trample any
statute or any man under my feet to do it, and am ready to
help any one hundred men to do it. But wait until the
daytime. The vaults of the banks in State street sympathize
<pb id="steve41" n="41"/>
with us. The Whigs,  who have been kicked once
too often, sympathize with us. It is in your power so
to block up every avenue, that the man cannot be
carried off. Do not, then, balk the effort of <sic corr="tomorrow">to-morrow</sic>
by foolish conduct to-night, giving the enemy
the alarm. You that are ready to do the real work, be not
carried away by indiscretion which may make shipwreck
of our hopes. The zeal that won't keep till <sic corr="tomorrow">to-morrow</sic> will
never free a slave.”</p>
          <p>By this time the orator had his audience well in hand,
when suddenly a man at the entrance of the Hall
shouted: “Mr. Chairman, I am just informed that a mob
of negroes is in Court Square attempting to rescue Burns.
I move that we adjourn to Court Square.” A formal vote
was not waited for, and the next instant the whole mass
was pouring down the broad stairs and along the streets
toward the new theatre of action.</p>
          <p>It is necessary to return and follow the movements of
the little band that had pledged themselves to the
forcible rescue of Burns. A place of rendezvous had been
appointed, but when the time for meeting arrived, only six
of the seven appeared. The defection of their faint-hearted
companion did not shake the purpose of the rest. Feeling,
however, that their number was too small, they agreed to
go forth, and, if possible, secure each man six coadjutors.
This effort was so successful that in a short time the
number of confederates was increased to nearly twenty-five.
Their weapons of attack were various; some were armed
with
<pb id="steve42" n="42"/>
revolvers, some carried axes, and some butcher's cleavers
that had just been purchased and were left in their paper
coverings for better concealment. In a passage-way hard
by, a large stick of timber had been secretly deposited to
serve as a battering-ram. Soon after nine o'clock,
everything was ready for the assault. It was at this
juncture that the alarm had been given to the meeting in
Faneuil Hall.</p>
          <p>Scarcely had the crowd from the Hall begun to pour
into the Square when the assault was commenced. The
lamps that lighted the Square had already been
extinguished, so that under cover of darkness the
assailants might more easily escape detection. Strangely
neglecting the eastern entrance, which was not secured
at the time,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">1</ref><note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">1 Col. Suttle happened to be in the Court House at the time, and
escaped by the east door after the attack commenced, leaving to
Batchelder and others the business of defending his property at
the risk and sacrifice of their lives.</note>
 they passed round to the west side and
commenced the attack in that quarter. The Court House
on that side presented to the eye an unbroken facade of
granite two hundred feet long and four stories high. In
the lower part were three entrances, closed by massive
two-leaved doors which were secured by heavy locks
and bolts. Against the middle one of these doors, the
beam which had been previously provided, was now
brought to bear with all the force that ten or twelve men
could muster. At the same moment, one or two others
plied their axes against the panels. As the quick, heavy
<figure id="ill4" entity="steve42"><p>NIGHT ATTACK ON THE COURT HOUSE.</p></figure>
<pb id="steve43" n="43"/>
blows resounded through the Square, the crowd, every
moment rapidly increasing, sent up their wild shouts of
encouragement, while some hurled missiles against the
windows, and others discharged their pistols in the same
direction. In two or three minutes, a panel in one part of
the door had been beaten through; the other part had
been partially forced back on its hinges, when the
assailants found their entrance obstructed by defenders
within. The Marshal, whose office was in the building,
although not anticipating the attack, was not altogether
unprepared for it. In the course of the day, he had
appointed fifty special aids, and posted them in different
parts of the spacious building; he had also caused to be
deposited in his office a large quantity of cutlasses. On
the first alarm, the specials were hastily armed with these
weapons and set to defend the assaulted door. As often
as the pressure from without forced it partially open, it
was closed again and braced by the persons of those
inside. While thus engaged, one of the Marshal's men, a
truck-man named Batchelder, suddenly drew back from
the door, exclaiming that he was stabbed. He was carried
into the Marshal's office and laid upon the floor, where
he almost immediately expired. It was discovered that a
wound, several inches in length, had been inflicted by
some sharp instrument in the lower part of his abdomen,
whereby an artery had been severed, causing him to
bleed to death. A conflict of opinion afterward arose
respecting the source from whence the blow proceeded.
Some
<pb id="steve44" n="44"/>
affirmed that it was an accident caused by one of his own
party. It was said that Batchelder was engaged at the
moment in bracing one part of the door with his
shoulders; that while he was in that half-stooping
posture, another of the specials, seeing through the
opening the hands of one of the assailants, aimed at them
a blow with a watchman's club, which, missing its mark,
fell upon the head of Batchelder and drove him down
upon the blade of his own cutlass. Another, and perhaps
more probable account was, that while Batchelder stood
bracing the door behind the broken panel, the wound was
inflicted by an arm thrust through from the outside, not
with any murderous intent, but to compel him to relax his
hold.</p>
          <p>In the temporary confusion within, caused by this fatal
result, the leader of the assailants, the Rev. Thomas W.
Higginson, succeeded in forcing his way into the
building. None followed him, and the door was almost
instantly closed again. For a moment he was alone,
face to face with his adversaries; the next, he re-appeared
on the outside, exclaiming to his associates, “You
cowards, will you desert us now?”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">1</ref><note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6">1 Two others, of those engaged in the attack, effected an
entrance a few moments later, and after Mr. Higginson's repulse.</note> A sabre cut across
the chin, and other marks, attested the rough reception he
had encountered while within the walls. The courage and
daring displayed by this person showed him to be a fit
leader in such an enterprise. He could trace his lineage
directly back to one of
<pb id="steve45" n="45"/>
the most distinguished of those who with Endicott at
Salem began the foundations of the Commonwealth.
Almost at the same moment with his repulse, eight or
nine of his companions were seized by the police,
who had quietly mingled in the crowd, and were borne
off to the watch-house. Intimidated by this sudden and
successful movement, and weakened by the loss of their
comrades, the rest made no further attempt, and very soon
the crowd began to disperse.</p>
          <p>The room in which Burns was confined, was on the
side of the building against which the attack was directed,
and in one of the upper stories. Burns had received a hint
of the intended assault, but his keepers were entirely
unprepared for it. The first sounds made by the assailants
below, filled them with extreme terror. Abandoning their
customary pastime of card-playing, they hastened to
extinguish the light, and to close the blinds at the
windows. Burns was then placed against the wall
between the two windows, for security against any
chance shot that might enter the room, while they
themselves crouched upon the floor in the farthest
corner. A box of pistols and cutlasses had been placed in
the room on the same day; this, Burns was forbidden to
approach. Their position did not justify such an excess of
fear. The extreme height of the room from the ground
placed it beyond the reach of danger from the outside,
while the door was barricaded by seven massive iron bars
extending from top to bottom at intervals of not
<pb id="steve46" n="46"/>
more than a foot.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">1</ref><note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7">1 The room in which Burns was confined, is indicated in the
preceding engraving by the lighted window in the third story. It
was a jury-room, and one of several which the County of Suffolk
had leased to the United States for the accommodation of the
federal courts. As Massachusetts had prohibited the use of her
prisons and jails for the confinement of fugitive slaves, the jury-
room had been converted into a cell for that purpose. The bars
were placed across the door on the occasion of Sims' arrest.
Immediately after the extradition of Burns, the United States
received a notice to quit the premises in thirty days, which was
done, and the federal courts were removed to a private dwelling
temporarily fitted up. The iron bars with their fastenings were
removed, and the room was afterwards partially destroyed,
(perhaps purified also,) by a fire that seriously threatened the
destruction of the whole building.</note> Had the assailants succeeded in
clearing their way through all other opposition., this
formidable barrier alone was sufficient to have held them
in check until the arrival of a military force.</p>
          <p>In another part of the building, the judges of the
Supreme Court of Massachusetts were assembled at the
same hour, awaiting the return of a jury. Some of the
latter having incautiously put their heads out of the
window to ascertain the nature of the tumult, were fired at
indiscriminately, to the serious danger of their lives.</p>
          <p>In the City Hall, hard by, the Mayor, with several
officers of the municipal government, happened to be
present at the same hour. Notified by the Chief of Police
of the state of affairs, he at once ordered out two
companies of artillery. Both arrived on the ground before
midnight, and were stationed, the one in the Court
House, the other in
<pb id="steve47" n="47"/>
the City Hall. At the same time, the Marshal dispatched
his deputy to procure a body of United States troops.
Proceeding to East Boston, the deputy there chartered a
steamer, directed his course with all speed to Fort
Warren, and took on board a corps of marines under
command of Maj. S. C. Ridgley. In six hours after, they
were quartered within the walls of the Court House.
Another company of marines was dispatched from the
Navy Yard in Charlestown, on the requisition of the
Marshal, and was also quartered in the same building.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
          <head>THE WRIT OF PERSONAL REPLEVIN.</head>
          <p>THE attempt to release Burns from duress by violence
having failed, steps were taken to accomplish the same
object by legal process. For this purpose resort was had
to the Writ of Personal Replevin. This writ is one of
those great safeguards which every free state is careful
to provide for protecting the liberty of its citizens. Less
famous than the Writ of Habeas Corpus, it is in some
respects more valuable than that, more efficacious in
securing the end for which both were instituted, and not
less worthy to be maintained in full operative vigor. To
obtain the writ of habeas corpus, special application must
be made to a judge on the bench or in chambers, and it
rests with him to grant or refuse it at his option; often it is
refused. The writ of replevin, on the other hand, issues of
course and of right; the prisoner, or any personal friend,
or any stranger acting in his behalf, may cause it to be
made at pleasure. As in the case of ordinary writs, blank
forms bearing the name of the Chief Justice abound; one
of these is filled up by an attorney or some competent
person, and placed in the hands of an officer, upon
whom,
<pb id="steve49" n="49"/>
from that moment, it becomes imperative. Under
the habeas corpus writ, no trial by jury can be had; the
judge alone hears the case, and sets the prisoner at
liberty or remands him into custody, as he sees fit. The
great benefit of the writ of replevin is, that it secures a
trial by jury. The judge, under the habeas corpus, will be
certain to remand the prisoner if he finds that he is
legally held; he will not consider the question of the
prisoner's inherent right to his liberty. But in the trial
under the writ of replevin, the prisoner may demand a
verdict upon the question whether be is righteously
restrained of his liberty, whatever the legal aspects of
the duress. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">1</ref><note id="note8" n="8" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref8">1 In Massachusetts, every person restrained of his liberty is
now entitled, <hi rend="italics">as of right and of course</hi> to the writ of <foreign lang="lat">habeas
corpus</foreign>. This privilege was secured by the act known as the
“Personal Liberty Law,” which was passed by two-thirds
of both Houses over the veto of Governor Gardner,
May 21, 1855. The extradition of Burns was the immediate
cause of this legislation.</note></p>
          <p>This great popular writ was one of the most
ancient known to the common law of England.
As such, it was introduced into the English colonies
in America. In Massachusetts, it remained a part of
the unwritten, or common law, from the earliest
period until the year 1786, when its provisions
were incorporated into a statute. For a period of
half a century, this statute continued unchanged
and in full force; then, by the enactment of the
Revised Statutes in 1836, the Writ of Personal
Replevin was abolished. By positive
<pb id="steve50" n="50"/>
enactment it ceased to form a part, not only of the
written, but also of the unwritten law of the
Commonwealth. The watchful friends of liberty at once
sounded the alarm, and in 1837 the Writ in all its pristine
vigor was restored to the statute book, where it still
remained at the time of Burns' arrest.</p>
          <p>The first use of this instrument, for the relief of Burns,
was made on the day following his arrest. A writ of
replevin was at that time made by Seth Webb, Jr., and
delivered to Coroner Charles Smith, who forthwith served
it upon the United States Marshal. The answer of the
latter was a quiet refusal to comply with the mandate of
the writ, on the ground that he held Burns by legal
process. No effort was made to enforce compliance; the
writ was returned into court with the proper indorsement;
and thus, for the moment, the matter rested.</p>
          <p>On Sunday, May twenty-eighth, the subject was
revived at an informal meeting of certain members of the
Boston Board of Aldermen, held for the purpose at the
office of the Chief of Police, who was also present. A
rescue of Burns from the custody of the Marshal before
the Commissioner's decision should be pronounced,
they did not propose. But it was thought that after the
decision, an interval of time might occur when a writ of
replevin could be served without involving a conflict
with the United States officers. Coroner Smith was
summoned to attend the conference.</p>
          <pb id="steve51" n="51"/>
          <p>On appearing, he was asked if he would undertake to
serve the writ at such a time as the one mentioned. With
some hesitation he agreed to do so, provided the
sanction of the Governor, Attorney-General, and City
Solicitor of Boston were first obtained. This answer was
thought satisfactory and the conference ended. On the
next day, the Coroner and Alderman Dunham sought an
interview on the subject with City Solicitor Hillard. The
Solicitor gave it as his opinion that no such interval of
time as they contemplated would occur, and strongly
advised them against proceeding with the writ.</p>
          <p>While this was passing, two citizens of Boston,
Samuel E. Sewall and Henry I. Bowditch, were moving in
another direction and with a bolder purpose. Mr. Sewall
was a lineal descendant of that ancient Chief Justice of
Massachusetts who, having been betrayed by the spirit
of the age into giving his judicial sanction to the
prosecutions for witchcraft, soon vindicated his innate
nobleness by a solemn act of repentance in a public
assembly of his fellow-citizens. The finer qualities of this
Puritan judge re-appeared in Mr. Sewall. A man of pure
and upright life, an eminent lawyer, a wise and
incorruptible friend of public liberty, he naturally rose to
be a <sic corr="conspicuous">conspicious</sic> character, and was more than once
honored with the nomination and support of his party for
the office of Governor. Mr. Bowditch was the son of
America's most illustrious mathematician, the
<pb id="steve52" n="52"/>
interpreter of Laplace. He was a physician of eminence,
and, like Mr. Sewall, uncompromisingly hostile to the
fugitive slave act.</p>
          <p>It was the desire of these gentlemen to have a writ of
replevin served with instant dispatch; they were quite
prepared to deliver Burns from duress without waiting for
the Commissioner's decision. But there was a serious
difficulty in the way. Burns was in the custody of an
officer who had expressed a determination to resist the
state process, and who had a strong civil and military
force to back him. It was plain that if the writ was to be
efficiently served, if Burns was to be taken out of the
Marshal's hands, it could only be done by the aid of a
force sufficient to overcome that which he had at his
command. Provided such a force were furnished him,
Coroner Smith expressed his readiness to serve the writ
and release the prisoner. The necessity of this condition
was apparent, and Mr. Sewall with his coadjutor
proceeded to take measures for obtaining the required
aid.</p>
          <p>Under the circumstances, the ordinary <foreign lang="lat">posse comitatus</foreign>
was out of the question; for it was not to be expected that
an undisciplined throng of civilians would be able to make
head against the <sic>serried</sic> ranks and balls and bayonets of
the Marshal's United States troops. The two gentlemen,
therefore, repaired to the State House for the purpose of
obtaining, if possible, a military force through the
intervention of the Governor, Emory Washburn.
They met him, by chance, in the office of
<pb id="steve53" n="53"/>
the Secretary of State, and at once made known the
object of their visit. Without informing him that a
writ of replevin had actually been issued, they put 
the case by supposition. A coroner of the city, they said,
was ready to undertake the service of such a writ,
provided he could be sustained by a proper force.
They asked, therefore, whether the Governor could
not order out a sufficient number of the militia to enable
him to do so. In reply, the Governor first reminded them
of the singular spectacle which would be presented to
the world if he were to comply with the request. The
militia were already under arms, by order of the Mayor
of Boston, to keep the peace and, suppress any attempt,
by a popular outbreak, to wrest Burns from the custody of
the United States Marshal: was it seemly for the Governor,
he inquired, to command the same militia to aid one of
the state officers in taking him by force from the same
custody? Aside from this view of the case, he said that
while he was willing to do anything in his power to aid
their wishes, he thought that the officer to whom the
writ might be committed, was invested by the statute
with all necessary power to summon to his aid the <foreign lang="lat">posse
comitatus.</foreign> But he doubted whether he had authority to
order out troops to aid in serving a particular precept,
unless a case of threatened violence or actual breach of
the peace could be made out, sufficient to call into
exercise the general power confided to the Commander-in-
chief for such an exigency. He then
<pb id="steve54" n="54"/>
read the provisions of the statute upon the subject, and
asked Mr. Sewall whether he, as a lawyer, considered
that the Governor had authority to call out troops for the
express purpose of executing the writ in question. To this
Mr. Sewall replied that he had looked at the matter,
himself, and had great doubts if the Governor had the
authority. But he added that in his view the fugitive slave
act was unconstitutional, and that, consequently, the
detention of Burns by the Marshal was unlawful. In
answer to this, the Governor said, that whatever might be
his private opinion on that point, he had been taught to
regard the judiciary as the interpreters of the law; that he
understood the courts to hold the law to be
constitutional; and that therefore he felt bound, in his
official relations, to regard it as such.</p>
          <p>Mr. Sewall now raised a different question. By the
statute providing for the writ of replevin, no person
could enjoy its benefit who was “in the custody of a
public officer of the law by the force of a lawful warrant
or other process, civil or criminal, issued by a court of
competent jurisdiction.” Burns was in the custody of the
United States Marshal by virtue of a Commissioner's
warrant. Mr. Sewall did not regard the Commissioner as a
court of competent jurisdiction, and consequently held
that Burns was entitled to the writ. But the Governor,
planting himself on the decisions of the Supreme Court,
held that the warrant was lawful, and that Burns could
not be
<pb id="steve55" n="55"/>
properly interfered with while in the Marshal's
custody. Yielding for the moment to this view of
the case, Mr. Sewall now inquired if the Governor
would order out troops to aid in serving the
writ, after Burns, by virtue of the Commissioner's
certificate, should have passed out of the Marshal's
custody and before he should have been removed
from the State? To this question, which was
substantially the same as that which Coroner
Smith had propounded to the City Solicitor, it
does not appear that the Governor returned any
specific answer, nor was it important that he
should. Mr. Sewall was satisfied, on a subsequent
examination of the fugitive slave act, that the
Commissioner's certificate would not give Suttle the
immediate possession of Burns, but that he would
remain in the custody of the Marshal without any
interval until he should be surrendered in Virginia.
No opportunity, therefore, would be afforded for
the writ upon Suttle within the jurisdiction
of Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>Having delivered his own views on the subject, the
Governor proposed that Mr. Sewall and his coadjutor
should lay the case before the Attorney General, John H.
Clifford, the legal adviser of the Executive. If that officer
were able to suggest any lawful mode in which he could
aid in serving the writ, he was ready to adopt it. Here the
interview ended. Mr. Sewall at once sought the
Attorney-General; but, not finding him readily, desisted
<pb id="steve56" n="56"/>
from further pursuit, in the conviction that his
opinion would be of an adverse character.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">1</ref><note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9">1 A little later in the day, John A. Andrew, a member of the
Suffolk Bar, waited on the Governor for the same purpose, but on
learning of the interview with the other gentlemen and its result,
he did not press the matter. The Governor received no other
application of any sort on the subject.</note></p>
          <p>The conduct of the Governor in this affair was
subjected, at the time, to severe animadversion. But
those who blamed him most were least informed
respecting the facts. Mr. Sewall, who, as one of the
parties, was familiar with all the circumstances, acquitted
and justified him. With the opinions which the Governor
entertained respecting his constitutional obligations,
there was, Mr. Sewall thought, no other course for him to
pursue. There, however, the justification stopped. The
conduct might be justified by the opinions of the
Governor, but the opinions themselves were condemned.</p>
          <p>It has been seen that the Governor felt bound,
whatever his private opinions or predilections, to defer
to the authority of the Supreme Court. A more
comprehensive survey of the action of that Court would
have furnished him with equal authority for an opposite
line of conduct. The particular decision upon which he
rested was that in the case of Sims. But there was an
earlier judgment of the Court, which, in the opinion of
eminent jurists, furnished ample sanction for the
application of the writ of replevin to persons in
<pb id="steve57" n="57"/>
precisely the predicament of Burns. This opinion was
directly connected with the restoration of the writ of
personal replevin to the statute book, in 1837. The
committee of the legislature which reported the bill
restoring the writ, also made an elaborate report on the
general subject of the trial by jury in questions of personal
freedom. In this report the opinion of the Court was cited,
and its vital bearing upon the question, whether a person
arrested as a fugitive slave was entitled to the writ of
replevin, was illustrated in the comments of the committee.
Very pertinently, the-opinion had its origin in the arrest
of a fugitive slave. One, Griffith, had been indicted for
an assault on a negro named Randolph. In his defence,
he alleged that Randolph was his slave, and that, by
virtue of the fugitive slave law of 1793, he had a right
to seize him. In their reply, the prosecuting officers
presented arguments against the validity of that law.
The Chief Justice, Parker, in giving his opinion, thus
disposed of them: “It is said that the act which is passed
on this subject is contrary to the amendment of the
Constitution securing the people in their persons and
property against seizures,&amp;c., without a complaint on oath,
&amp;c. <hi rend="italics">It is very obvious that slaves are not parties to the
Constitution, and the amendment has relation to the
parties. * * * *  But it is objected that a person may,
in this summary manner, seize a freeman. It may be so,
but it would be attended with mischievous consequences
to the person making the seizure, and a habeas corpus
would lie to obtain the release of the</hi>
<pb id="steve58" n="58"/>
<hi>person seized.”</hi> And if a habeas corpus, said the
committee, then of course the concurrent remedies,
including the writ of personal replevin.</p>
          <p>“The principle here stated,” observed the committee,
“when carried out relieves the act of Congress (the act
of 1793) of all its obnoxious features, and places the
question, <hi rend="italics">under the law,</hi> precisely where the
committee would have placed it, <hi rend="italics">under the
constitution,</hi> without the law. It holds that the
proceedings are constitutional as to<hi rend="italics"> slaves,</hi> and
unconstitutional as to <hi rend="italics">freemen,</hi> and gives the person
seized, the right to try the question as to his character,
by any suitable independent process. And this principle
must extend to his situation, either before or after the
certificate, for the jurisdiction of the magistrate, upon the
same reasoning, must be special and limited, depending
entirely for its foundation upon the fact whether the
person so seized be a slave; for if he be not, the whole
proceedings are void, as against the express provisions
of the constitution. It makes, then, the claimant act at his
peril throughout, and gives the person seized an
opportunity to try, in another form, the applicability of
the process to him, and that, too, wherever he chooses.”</p>
          <p>The committee therefore expressed the opinion that
“whether the law be considered unconstitutional on the
one hand, or valid on the other, upon the construction
recognized by the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth,
the same result must be arrived at. In either case, a
person seized under the act of Congress, before or after
certificate given,
<pb id="steve59" n="59"/>
may have an independent process, under which he can
try his right to the character of a freeman.” In concluding
their report, the committee remarked, in view of the fact
that the writ of personal replevin might be used by
persons arrested as fugitive slaves in the investigation
of their claim to freedom, that “they looked to that use of
the writ as one of its just and legitimate offices.”
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">1</ref><note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">1 Report of the Judiciary Committee “on the trial by jury in
questions of personal freedom” made to the Massachusetts
House of Representatives, March 27, 1837. The author of the
report was James C. Alvord.</note></p>
          <p>The court's opinion and the committee's interpretation
of it had reference to the fugitive slave act of 1793. But
they were equally applicable to the fugitive slave act of
1850, for they asserted the general principle that no act
of Congress could deprive a person of his constitutional
right to try the question of his freedom. Accepting this
exposition, planting himself by the side, deferring to the
venerable authority, of Chief Justice Parker and his
associates on the Supreme Bench, the Governor might
have said to Mr. Sewall: “Burns is entitled by the
constitution and the law to the writ of personal replevin.
Make your writ and bid the officer serve it upon the
United States Marshal forthwith. If he refuses to obey,
let the officer summon the <foreign lang="lat">posse comitatus</foreign> and enforce
the service. If the Marshal resists with the military force
under his command, the case will have arisen in which it
becomes the duty of the Governor by law to act. Then
make your application
<pb id="steve60" n="60"/>
to me, and I will call out troops to aid in enforcing the writ.” <ref targOrder="U" id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11">1</ref><note id="note11" n="11" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref11">1 The whole argument may be briefly stated thus:
1.  The fugitive slave acts of 1793 and 1850 are
commensurate as to “competent jurisdiction.” 2. The
constitutionality of both has been affirmed by the
Supreme Court in two different decisions. 3. The right
of the person seized, to an independent trial of the
question of his character, is affirmed in the first
decision and not denied in the second, 4. The writ of
personal replevin was provided by the Commonwealth
expressly to secure such a trial; therefore, 5. The
affirmation of the constitutionality of the fugitive
slave act of 1850 is no bar to the use of the writ of
personal replevin for the purpose of determining the
character of the person seized as a slave.</note></p>
          <p>The interview with the Governor took place on
Monday, the twenty-ninth. Nothing further was done
respecting the writ until the following Wednesday. By
that time the prisoner's case had assumed an
unexpectedly favorable aspect. It was anticipated that
the Commissioner would set him at liberty. In such a
case threats had been made that Suttle would seize him
again without warrant and carry him off.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">2</ref><note id="note12" n="12" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes">2 Suttle had resolved, <hi rend="italics">under the advice of District Attorney
Hallett,</hi> if the Commissioner's decision should be adverse
to his claim, to seize Burns by force, remove him from
the State, and for justification of the act rely on his ability
to prove ownership after getting back to Virginia. This
purpose was announced by Suttle, on the morning of
June 1, to a circle of his southern friends at the Revere
House, and in the hearing of the Rev. M. D. Conway, of
Washington, who subsequently stated the fact to Charles
M. Ellis, Esq., of Boston, and the Rev. George E. Ellis,
of Charlestown.</note> To meet this
contingency (and no other), a writ of replevin was made
on that day and placed in the hands of Coroner Smith.
The contingency did not occur, and the writ remained as
waste paper in the officer's possession.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">3</ref><note id="note13" n="13" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref13">3 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixb">Appendix B.</ref></note></p>

          <head>THE ATTEMPT TO PURCHASE BURNS.</head>
          <p>THE rising anger of the people filled the claimant's
counsel with dismay. They feared for their own
personal safety. They went constantly armed; one of
them even attempted a sort of disguise. Avoiding the
thronged thoroughfares, they stole to and from the
Court House through the most unfrequented streets.
The attack on the Court House, with the death of
Batchelder, wrought their fears to a still higher pitch.
It showed them that there was a band of men ready
for the most desperate service that might be necessary.
It prophesied fearfully of the future. What would ensue
if the fugitive were surrendered? Surrendered, they at
least were well assured he would be. Foreseeing this
result, and taking counsel of their fears, they now
resolved to avert the threatening tempest by offering
Burns for sale. Thus, it was with Col. Suttle and his
advisers that this proposal originated.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14">1</ref><note id="note14" n="14" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14">1 Colonel Suttle, despite the endorsement of his courage by
Virginia, implied in his military title, appears to have been
thrown into a state of extreme terror by the angry demonstrations
which he had provoked. For greater personal security, he
changed his quarters, in the Revere House, from a lower story
to the attic, barricaded his door at night, and kept under pay
four armed men to lodge with him in the room and guard him
from danger. The demonstrations which so excited his fears,
proceeded chiefly from the colored men of the city. For example,
four or five powerful fellows maintained an unceasing watch
on a street corner, which commanded a view of his window,
and never left the spot while he was known to be in the house,
except to give place to a fresh set. It was afterward confessed
that this expedient was adopted merely to intimidate the
Colonel, and it seems to have been quite successful.</note></p>
          <pb id="steve62" n="62"/>
          <p>The first announcement of this purpose was made in
open court on Saturday morning. The counsel for Burns
had moved for a postponement of the examination, for
the purpose of gaining a little time to prepare the
defence. To this the counsel for Suttle objected.</p>
          <p>“Let the examination proceed now,” said one of them,
Edward G. Parker, “and if Burns is given up, I am
authorized to say that he can be purchased.”</p>
          <p>Among those who heard this statement, was one who
had already done and suffered much in behalf of fugitive
slaves. This man was the Rev. L. A. Grimes, the pastor of
a congregation of colored persons in Boston.
Approaching the counsel, Mr. Grimes inquired upon
what authority the statement had been made. “Col.
Suttle has agreed to sell Burns,” was the reply. Mr.
Parker added that the sum which he had agreed to accept
was twelve hundred dollars. But a condition annexed
was, that the sale should be made <hi rend="italics">after</hi> the surrender
had been decreed. Mr. Grimes inquired if Col. Suttle
would not consent to receive the sum named and close a
bargain before the surrender. The counsel thought not.
Bent on securing this concession,
<pb id="steve63" n="63"/>
Mr. Grimes sought an interview with the Marshal,
by whom, on mentioning his object, he was referred to
Col. Suttle. An introduction of the slave-rescuer to the
slave-hunter took place, and a long conversation ensued.
Suttle enlarged on the fact of his ownership, on the
kindness with which he had treated Burns, and also on
the latter's good character. But to all suggestions for a
sale before the surrender, he refused to listen. A private
interview between Suttle and his counsel followed. At
the close of it, the latter sought Mr. Grimes and informed
him that their client had at length agreed to sell his slave
<hi rend="italics">before</hi> the surrender was made. The prompt response of
Mr. Grimes was—“Between this time and ten o'clock
to-night, I'll have the money ready for you; have the
emancipation papers ready for me at that hour.”</p>
          <p>A busy day's work lay before the benevolent pastor.
The morning was already well advanced, and before the
day closed, twelve hundred dollars were to be raised,
not one of which had yet been subscribed, Without
resources himself, he had to seek out others who might
be disposed to contribute to the enterprise. A wealthy
citizen, whose sympathies had hitherto been on the side
of the fugitive slave act, had been heard to say that if
Burns could be purchased he would head the subscription
list with a hundred dollars. Informed of this by Suttle's
counsel, Mr. Grimes called at the gentleman's house, and
on the third attempt succeeded in finding him. The
gentleman admitted
<pb id="steve64" n="64"/>
that he had made the pledge already mentioned, but he
now declined to redeem it. He had since met a person, he
said, who had assured him that the slave could not be
purchased,—that he must be tried.</p>
          <p>“I have heard no one take that ground but the United
States District Attorney,” said Mr. Grimes.</p>
          <p>The gentleman confessed that it was Attorney Hallett
who had dissuaded him from acting upon his benevolent
impulse. Without money, but with a promise from him to
give “something,” which was never redeemed, Mr.
Grimes left the house.</p>
          <p>He now bent his steps toward the mansion of a
gentleman distinguished for his immense wealth, his rare
munificence, and the eminent position which he had
formerly held in the service of his country abroad.
Everything conspired to ally him with the conservative
class of society, and it was with them that public opinion
commonly ranked him. What view he would take of the
passing events was uncertain. Mr. Grimes found him in
an unusually discomposed frame of mind. The
announcement of his errand at once called forth an
emphatic expression of sentiment and feeling. He
denounced the fugitive slave act as “an infamous
statute,” and declared that he would have nothing to do
with it. It had been the cause of bloodshed and slaughter,
and would be the cause of still more. Referring to the
death of Batchelder, he intimated that, as the man had
been killed while voluntarily assisting to execute an
infamous law,
<pb id="steve65" n="65"/>
he had no regrets to express at the occurrence. He
could give no money to purchase the freedom of Burns,
as that, in his view, would be an implied sanction of the
law; but, if Mr. Grimes needed any money for his own
uses, he might draw on him for the required sum, or even
for a larger amount.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15">1</ref><note id="note15" n="15" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref15">1 The above was written while ABBOTT LAWRENCE
was yet living. Now that death has set his seal on all his
acts and opinions, I need no longer hesitate to name him
as the person alluded to. Let the sentiments expressed in
the text go forth to the public under the sanction of such
a name.</note> Thus encouraged, Mr. Grimes took
his leave.</p>
          <p>A gentleman belonging to a family distinguished for
its ability, and especially for its devotion to the
fugitive slave law, was next applied to. At once
intimating his readiness to contribute to the proposed
purchase, he suggested that his brother, a wealthy
merchant, should be summoned for the same purpose.
The latter soon made his appearance and entered
heartily into the scheme. Each subscribed one hundred
dollars on condition that the whole sum should be
raised. Both were urgent in pressing forward the
matter; “the man,” said one of them, “must be out of the
Court House tonight.” If the sum should not be made
up, he was ready to increase his subscription.
From another distinguished citizen the sum of fifty
dollars was obtained; he was the only member of the
national legislature from Massachusetts who had
<sic>perilled</sic> his reputation by voting for the fugitive slave
bill. A subscription was next solicited
<pb id="steve66" n="66"/>
from a certain rich broker in State street. He had
been an ardent supporter of the fugitive act; on the
occasion of sending Sims back into slavery he had
offered five thousand dollars, if need were, to secure that
triumph. Mr. Grimes now found him in a different mood.
He would give nothing to purchase Burns—there would
be no end to demands of that sort; but he would readily
contribute one hundred dollars, he said, to procure a
coat of tar and feathers for the slave-catchers.
Apparently, his patriotism cost him nothing on either
occasion. Another millionaire of the city, who enjoyed a
reputation for liberality, upon being solicited to
subscribe, declined on the ground that it would only
furnish an inducement for slaveholders to repeat their
reclamations. At the same time, he declaimed with great
bitterness against the law.</p>
          <p>Hamilton Willis, a broker in State street, responded to
the call with the most active sympathy. He urged Mr.
Grimes to obtain pledges for the necessary amount, and
agreed to advance the money upon those pledges.
Another noble contributor was one who, as a Trustee of
the Emigrant Aid Society, afterward distinguished
himself in peopling Kansas with freemen. This was J. M.
S. Williams, a native of Virginia, but then a merchant in
Boston. Subscribing at once a hundred dollars, he gave
assurance that whatever sum might be deficient in the
end, he would make good.</p>
          <pb id="steve67" n="67"/>
          <p>Smaller amounts were subscribed by various other
persons.</p>
          <p>At seven o'clock in the evening, Mr. Grimes had
obtained pledges for eight hundred dollars.
Repairing to the office of the United States Marshal, he
there, according to appointment, met Mr. Willis. The
latter at once filled up his cheque for the eight hundred
dollars and placed it in the hands of the Marshal, to be
applied toward the purchase of Burns. The counsel of
Suttle had also agreed to meet Mr. Grimes at the same
time and place, but they failed to make their appearance.
The truth was, that, in the excess of their anxiety to have
the purchase of Burns effected, one of them had
undertaken to solicit subscriptions himself, and was still
absent on that business.</p>
          <p>Again Mr. Grimes went forth,—this time in
company with a well known philanthropist,—and
several hours were spent in fruitless <sic corr="endeavors">endavors</sic> to
make up the required amount. Late in the evening,
they drove to the Revere House, where Col. Suttle
had taken rooms. Soon after, the two gentlemen who
acted as his counsel arrived there also. One of them
now informed Mr. Grimes that he had called on the
two brothers already spoken of as being so eager
for the purchase of Burns, from one of whom he
had received a cheque for four hundred dollars
additional to his previous subscription. This was
a temporary advance, however, made for the purpose
of consummating the transaction within the time
prescribed by Col. Suttle,
<pb id="steve68" n="68"/>
and to be refunded on the following Monday. The
required sum was thus completed, and nothing remained
but to execute the bill of sale.</p>
          <p>It was now half-past ten o'clock. Another half hour
was consumed by a private interview between Suttle and
his counsel. The several parties then separated to meet
immediately after, at the private office of Commissioner
Loring, with whom one of Suttle's counsel had already
made an arrangement to draw up the instrument of sale.
The Commissioner soon made his appearance, and at
once proceeded to write a bill of sale, in these words:</p>
          <p>“Know all men by these presents, that I, Charles F.
Suttle, of Alexandria in Virginia, in consideration of
twelve hundred dollars to me paid, do hereby release and
discharge, quitclaim and convey to Antony Byrne<ref targOrder="U" id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16">1</ref><note id="note16" n="16" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16">1 The name has been variously spelt; as the slave of
Col. Suttle he was probably known by the name given
in the bill of sale. But by his baptism of suffering he
took the name of Anthony Burns, and under that
designation entered upon his new life of freedom.</note> his
liberty; and I hereby manumit and release him from all
claims and service to me forever, hereby giving him his
liberty to all, intents and effects forever. In testimony
whereof I have hereunto set my hand and seal, this
twenty-seventh day of May, in the year of our Lord
eighteen hundred and fifty-four.”</p>
          <p>Having completed this instrument, the Commissioner
sent a messenger to Marshal Freeman, requesting his
attendance at the office of the former. The Marshal
declined to comply with this request.</p>
          <pb id="steve69" n="69"/>
          <p>Mr. Loring then gathered up his papers, and, with
the other parties, proceeded to the Marshal's office,
where they found that official in company with
District Attorney Hallett. He at once began to confer
with the Marshal concerning the purchase of Burns,
when Hallett interposed and strenuously objected to the
transaction. He maintained that if Burns were, by
purchase, taken out of the hands of the United States
officers, before the examination were concluded, nobody
would be responsible for the expenses already incurred;
and he took it upon him to add that the Government
would not defray them. To this the Commissioner replied
by reading a portion of the fugitive slave act. That, he
contended, made the Government responsible for the
expenses; by the sale, Suttle would obtain an equivalent
for his slave, and thus the law would be substantially
enforced. This absurd objection having been thus
silenced, the District Attorney was ready with another.
There was, he said, an existing law of Massachusetts,
which prohibited such a transaction. The Commissioner
promptly replied that the law referred to was not applicable
to the case in hand; that it was a law aimed not
against selling a man into freedom, but against selling
him into slavery.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17">1</ref><note id="note17" n="17" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref17">1 The statute referred to, I presume, was this: “Every person 
who shall sell, or in any manner transfer for any term,
<hi rend="italics">the service or labor</hi> of any negro, mulatto, or other Person of
unlawfully seized color who shall have been taken, inveigled,
or kidnapped from this State to any other State, place, or
country, shall be Punished by imprisonment in the State Prison
not more than ten years, or by a fine not exceeding one
thousand dollars and imprisonment in the county jail not
more than two years.”—<bibl><hi rend="italics">Revised Statutes of Massachusetts, 
<lb/>Chap. 125, Sec. 20.</hi></bibl></note> As Mr. Hallett was not
<pb id="steve70" n="70"/>
required to be a party to the transaction, his concern on
this point seemed to be somewhat gratuitous. Failing
to produce conviction by arguments of this character, as
a last resort he urged that the sale, if effected then, would
not be legal, as the Sabbath had already commenced.
Glancing toward the clock, the Commissioner saw that the
minute-hand pointed to a quarter past twelve. He ceased
to urge the point further, and, turning to Mr. Grimes, said:
“It can be done at eight o'clock on Monday morning—come
to my office then, and it can be settled in five minutes.” The
negotiations were then broken off.</p>
          <p>Mr. Grimes turned away in deep disappointment. So
confident was he of success, that he had a carriage in
waiting at the door of the Court House to bear Burns away
as a freeman. The prisoner had been apprised of the
movement in his behalf, and with feverish intent was
momently waiting for his release. Mr. Grimes now asked
permission to communicate to him the result of the
negotiations, and thus relieve him of a most painful
suspense; but the Marshal refused his consent, at the same
time charging himself with the duty.</p>
          <p>As the Sabbath wore on, rumors spread through the city
that dispatches unfavorable to the release of the prisoner
had been received from the Federal
<pb id="steve71" n="71"/>
Government. Full of fears, Mr. Grimes sought an
interview, at evening, with the Commissioner, at his
private residence. The latter endeavored to re-assure him.
Col. Suttle, he still felt confident, would abide by his
agreement. “But if he fails to,” said the Commissioner,
“and the counsel for the defence can raise a single doubt,
Burns shall walk out of the Court House a free man.” He
closed the interview by renewing the appointment to meet
at eight o'clock, the next morning, for completing the
purchase.</p>
          <p>Punctual at the hour, Mr. Grimes repaired to the
Commissioner's office, but the latter failed to appear.
After waiting an hour, he went in pursuit of the delinquent
functionary, but without success. He then sought Col.
Suttle and his counsel at the Revere House; they were not
there. At length he found them, together with Brent,
Hallett, and the Marshal, assembled in the office of the
latter.  Reminding them of the appointment they had
broken, he announced his readiness to complete the
contract which had already been verbally made. Then Col.
Suttle proceeded to vindicate his Virginian honor. As
the bargain had not been completed on Saturday night,
he said he should now decline to sell Burns; the trial
must go on.</p>
          <p>“After Burns gets back to Virginia,” he graciously added,
“you can then have him.”</p>
          <p>In vain Mr. Grimes urged that the failure on Saturday night
occurred through no fault of his. Mr. Hallett here interrupted
him.</p>
          <pb id="steve72" n="72"/>
          <p>“No,” said he, “when Burns has been tried and
carried back to Virginia and the law executed, you can
buy him; and then I will pay one hundred dollars
towards his purchase.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Grimes insisted that by agreement the man was
already his. The District Attorney then said:</p>
          <p>“The laws of the land cannot be trampled upon. A
man has been killed; that blood”—pointing to the
spot in the Marshal's office where Batchelder had
breathed his last—“must be atoned for.” Mr. Hallett
thus assumed a responsibility from which he afterward,
through the public press, vainly endeavored to escape.</p>
          <p>Baffled and despondent, Mr. Grimes turned away and
sought those who had subscribed to the purchase fund.
He first met that supporter of the fugitive slave act who
had manifested such anxiety for the release of Burns on
Saturday, and who had subscribed a hundred dollars.
“If the man is to be tried,” said this subscriber, “I refuse to
give a cent for his purchase; I would rather give five
hundred dollars than have the trial go on.” It was not
the well-being of the slave that he sought; it was to save
Boston from the ignominy arising from the execution of
the fugitive slave act. Other subscribers took substantially
the same position, and thus the subscription fell to the
ground. Some further attempts to effect the purchase were
made, in which the philanthropic broker, Mr. Willis, bore
the principal share. The story of his efforts and their
result is best given in his own words.</p>
          <pb id="steve73" n="73"/>
          <p>“Tuesday morning,” he writes, “I had an interview
with Col. Suttle in the United States Marshal's office. He
seemed disposed to listen to me, and met the subject in a
manly way. He said he wished to take the boy [Burns]
back, after which he would sell him. He wanted to see the
result of the trial at any rate. I stated to him that we
considered his claim to Burns clear enough, and that he
would be delivered over to him, urging particularly upon
him that the boy's liberation was not sought for except
with his free consent, and his claim being fully satisfied. I
urged upon him no consideration of the fear of a rescue,
or possible unfavorable result of the trial to him, but
offered distinctly, if he chose, to have the trial proceed,
and whatever might be the result, still to satisfy his claim.
I stated to him that the negotiation was not sustained by
any society or association whatsoever, but that it was
done by some of our most respectable citizens, who were
desirous not to obstruct the operation of the law, but in a
peaceable and honorable manner sought an adjustment
of this unpleasant case; assuring him that this feeling
was general among the people. I read to him a letter
addressed to me by a highly esteemed citizen, urging me
to renew my efforts to accomplish this, and placing at my
disposal any amount of money that I might deem
necessary for the purpose.</p>
          <p>“Col. Suttle replied that he appreciated our motives,
and that he felt disposed to meet us. He then stated
what he would do. I accepted his
<pb id="steve74" n="74"/>
proposal at once; it was not entirely satisfactory to me,
but yet, in view of his position as he declared to me, I was
content. At my request, he was about to commit our
agreement to writing, when Mr. B. F. Hallett entered the
office, and they two engaged in conversation apart from
me. Presently Col. Suttle returned to me, and said ‘I must
withdraw what I have done with you.’ We both
immediately approached Mr. Hallett, who said, pointing
to the spot where Mr. Batchelder fell, in sight of which we
stood,—‘That blood must be avenged.’ I made some
pertinent reply, rebuking so extraordinary a speech, and
left the room.</p>
          <p>“On Friday (June 2d), soon after the decision had
been rendered, finding Col. Suttle had gone on board the
cutter [which was to carry Burns back to Virginia] at an
early hour, I waited upon his counsel at the Court House,
and there renewed my proposition. Both these gentlemen
promptly interested themselves in my purpose, which
was to tender the claimant full satisfaction, and receive
the surrender of Burns from him, either there, in State
street, or on board the revenue cutter, at his own option.
It was arranged between us that Mr. Parker [junior
counsel for Suttle] should go at once on board the cutter
and make an arrangement if possible, with the Colonel. I
provided ample funds, and returned immediately to the
Court House, when I found that there would be difficulty
in getting on board the cutter. Application
<pb id="steve75" n="75"/>
was made by me to the Marshal; he interposed no
objection, and I offered to place Mr. Parker alongside the
vessel. Presently Mr. Parker took me aside, and said
these words: ‘Col. Suttle has pledged himself to Mr.
Hallett that he will not sell his boy until he gets him
home.<corr>’</corr> Thus the matter ended.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18">1</ref><note id="note18" n="18" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref18">1 Letter of Hamilton Willis, addressed to the Editors of the
Boston Atlas and Published in that journal, June 5,1854, in reply
to Mr. Hallett's public denial of the charge that he had interfered
to Prevent the purchase of Burns.</note></p>
          <p>When Burns was fairly out to sea, on his way back to
Virginia, and beyond the reach of immediate aid, the
officers of the division of Massachusetts militia that had
assisted in enforcing his rendition, also made an effort
toward procuring his emancipation. Assembling at one of
their ward houses, they formally organized themselves
into a meeting, and unanimously raised a committee to
obtain funds for the purchase of Burns. Their purpose
took a still more definite shape: jealous for the honor of
their military body, they voted that the subscription
should be strictly confined to the officers and members
of their division. Unhappily, this was the end, as well as
the beginning, of their efforts. The cause of the failure, as
afterwards assigned by some of their number, was the
severe criticism with which their participation in the
surrender had been treated by the public press. Finding
that the proposed benefaction was not likely to efface
from the public mind the remembrance
<pb id="steve76" n="76"/>
of their previous official conduct, they abandoned their
purpose and prudently reserved their money.</p>
          <p>In time, news reached Boston that Burns had arrived
in Virginia. The law had been executed, the point of
honor had been satisfied, Slavery had its own again.
Negotiations were once more renewed. At the request of
Mr. Grimes, Mr. Willis addressed a letter to Col. Suttle on
the subject. The reply of the latter is entitled to a place in
this history.</p>
          <p>“I have had much difficulty in my own mind,” he
writes, “as to the course I ought to pursue about the
sale of my man, Anthony Burns, to the North. Such a
sale is objected to strongly by my friends, and by the
people of Virginia generally, upon the ground of its
pernicious character, inviting our negroes to attempt
their escape under the assurance that, if arrested and
remanded, still the money would be raised to purchase
their freedom. As a southern man and a slave-owner, I
feel the force of this objection and clearly see the
mischief that may result from disregarding it. Still, I feel
no little attachment to Anthony, which his late
elopement, [with] the vexation and expense to which I
have been put, has not removed; and I confess to some
disposition to see the experiment tried of bettering his
condition.</p>
          <p>“I understand the application now made to purchase
his freedom, does not come from the abolitionists and
incendiaries who put the laws of
<pb id="steve77" n="77"/>
the Union at defiance, and dyed their hands in the blood
of Batchelder, but from those who struggled to maintain
law and order.</p>
          <p>“Now that the laws have been fully vindicated
(although at the point of the bayonet) and Anthony
returned to the city of Richmond, from which he
escaped; and believing that it would materially
strengthen the Federal Officers and facilitate the
execution of the laws in any future case which might
arise, and influenced by other considerations to which I
have referred, I have concluded to sell him his freedom
for the sum of fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>“When in Boston, acting under the extraordinary
counsel of Mr. Parker, one of my lawyers, I agreed to take
twelve hundred dollars if paid at a fixed period. The
money was not forthcoming at the time agreed upon,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19">1</ref><note id="note19" n="19" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref19">1 This was not true, as the narrative in the former part of this
chapter shows.</note> and
I then, being better advised, determined the law should
take its course.</p>
          <p>“By the course pursued of violent, corrupt, and
perjured opposition to my rights, the case was protracted
for days after my offer to take twelve hundred dollars;
consequently my expenses were generally increased,
I presume materially so to my attorneys, to whom I
paid from my private purse four hundred dollars.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20">2</ref><note id="note20" n="20" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref20">2 The excuse which Col. Suttle here presents for his exorbitant
demand for Burns will hardly stand a severe scrutiny. According
to his own admission, he had agreed to accept twelve hundred
dollars. Afterward, acting under “better advice,” he withdrew his
offer for the purpose of letting the law take its course. The law
did take its course, and an increase of his expenses was the natural
result. The proposed purchasers were anxious to have him take a
step that would diminish his expenses; he insisted on pursuing a
course which he knew would increase them, and then, because
they were increased, required that the purchasers should bear the
burden. It furnishes some relief to one's sense of justice to know
that he was afterwards obliged to go farther and fare worse.</note></p>
          <pb id="steve78" n="78"/>
          <p>“Now, as I am not a man of wealth, and I am bound to
have a moderate regard for my private interest, it will
readily be seen that twelve hundred dollars at the time I
agreed to take it, would have been better for me than
fifteen hundred now.</p>
          <p>“In reply to your question about his (Burns,)
character, I have to say that I regard him as strictly
honest, sober, and truthful. Let me hear from you without
delay. If you accede to my terms, I will, on receipt of the
money, deliver him in the city of Washington with his
free papers, or I will send him by one of the steamers from
Richmond to New York.”</p>
          <p>With this new proposition, the indefatigable pastor,
Grimes, sought first of all Mr. Hallett, and, informing him
of its nature, plainly told the attorney that, as he was the
only one who had hindered the purchase of Burns at
twelve hundred dollars, he alone ought to bear the
burden of the excess now demanded over that sum.
Hallett refused to grace himself by such an act of justice,
but, nevertheless, declared his willingness to give a
hundred dollars toward the sum required. Col. Suttle's
proposition was next laid before the persons who had
acted as
<pb id="steve79" n="79"/>
his counsel. They addressed a letter to him, declaring
it as their opinion that he was bound to accept twelve
hundred dollars for Burns ; but nothing came of this
remonstrance. Mr. Grimes then applied to the original
subscribers to the twelve hundred dollar fund. Most
of them were ready to renew their pledges, provided
Burns could be purchased for that amount; but they
absolutely refused to give anything if a higher sum were
insisted on. Col. Suttle was then informed by Mr. Grimes
that he could still have the twelve hundred dollars,
but nothing more. To this no answer was ever returned,
and for the time all efforts to ransom Burns were at
an end.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
          <head>THE EXAMINATION.</head>
          <p>THE examination in due form commenced on
Monday, the twenty-ninth of May. Court Square
presented on that morning a strange and alarming
scene in free Massachusetts. There was nothing
to indicate that a solemn judicial proceeding
was about to take place. The Court House, an
immense pile of stone, resembling, in its massive
strength, a donjon keep of the middle ages, wore
the air of a beleaguered fortress. At the windows
in different stories of the building, the mingled
soldiery of Massachusetts and of the United States
presented themselves, with firearms, as at the
embrasures of a rampart. Below, a vast throng of
citizens, which had been constantly increasing from
early dawn, surged around the base of the building
and through the spacious Square in unappeasable
excitement. All the outer entrances of the Court
House had been securely closed, except one at
which was stationed a strong force of the police.
Even here, none were allowed to enter but the
functionaries, the reporters for the press, and a few
citizens who, by special favor, had obtained permits
<pb id="steve81" n="81"/>
from the Marshal.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21">1</ref><note id="note21" n="21" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref21">1 In some instances, citizens of Massachusetts were excluded,
while citizens of southern states were readily admitted.
Charles G. Davis, Esq., of Plymouth, a well known lawyer,
applied for admission in company with a friend. The latter
was allowed to pass, on being introduced as “a gentleman
from Washington, D. C.;” but Mr. Davis was kept out,
and furthermore, was told by the underlings that they had
orders to exclude him and all other “free-soilers.” As a
member of the Massachusetts Bar he had a <hi rend="italics">right</hi> to enter.</note> Once within the walls, it was not
certain that the adventurous citizen would be able to
make his way to the tribunal. At the foot of the stairs
leading to the court-room, files of soldiers barred the
passage with their muskets, and raised them only at the
nod of a customhouse officer deputed for the service.
On the first landing-place were stationed more soldiers
with fixed bayonets, and others still, at the head of the
stairs. So strictly was the guard maintained, that those
who had passed the first sentries were, in some instances,
arrested and detained upon the stairway by the last.
And not until the last moment before the opening of
the court, were any except the officials, allowed to pass.
Never before, in the history of Massachusetts, had the
avenues to a tribunal of justice been so obstructed by
serried bayonets borne in the hands of an alien and
mercenary soldiery.</p>
          <p>The court-room was not spacious, but it more than
sufficed to contain those who were suffered to enter it.
Many seats remained vacant as silent witnesses to the
excessive fears of those who had enlisted in this
enterprise against the popular feeling.</p>
          <pb id="steve82" n="82"/>
          <p>Of those who were present, the most conspicuous,
if not the most numerous portion, were pimps and bullies,
whose vile passions and brutal natures had left a
permanent impress upon their persons. Some of them,
now appearing as officers of justice, were convicted
criminals and had served out their sentence in the
prisons. These carried it boldly, as though they had been
presented with the freedom of the court-room; while the
few good citizens present,—some, men of substance, and
some, men of renown,—took their seats quietly as being
conscious that they were there on sufferance. Nothing,
perhaps, more clearly revealed the nature of the business
in hand than the fact that the Marshal was compelled to
rely for aid, chiefly, on the most depraved class of men in
the community.</p>
          <p>At length the court was opened. Alone, upon the
bench from which Judge Story had been wont to
dispense justice, sat the Commissioner, evidently
oppressed by the load which he had chosen to take upon
himself. In his appropriate place on the right stood the
Marshal, Watson Freeman, in whose massy face, seamed
by small pox, a certain look of good humor somewhat
modified the prevailing relentlessness of its aspect. Over
against the Commissioner, upon a seat just without the
bar, sat Anthony Burns. On either side of him, as guards,
sat two or three brutal-looking men, and in front of him,
just within the bar, were four or five more, with pistols
and bludgeons lurking in
<pb id="steve83" n="83"/>
their pockets and but half concealed from the offended
eyes of the spectators. At the clerk's desk, apart, sat the
United States District Attorney, Benjamin F. Hallett,
whose business there did not clearly appear. The counsel
for the slaveholder and the slave respectively, the
reporters for the press, the slaveholder and his southern
friends, Theodore Parker, the Rev. L. A. Grimes, Morris,
the colored lawyer of Boston, and some few others
occupied the seats within the bar; while a moderate
number outside completed the assemblage.</p>
          <p>The first incident in the proceedings illustrated the
character of the tribunal. Charles M. Ellis, the junior
counsel for Burns, began with a protest against
proceeding in the case under the extraordinary
circumstances of the occasion.</p>
          <p>“It is not fit,” said he, “that we should proceed while
counsel here (meaning the counsel for Suttle) bear arms.
It is not fit that the prisoner should sit here with
shackles on his limbs. It is not fit that we should proceed
while the court-room is packed with armed men, and all
the avenues to it are filled with soldiery, making it
difficult for the friends of the prisoner to obtain access to
him. I protest against proceeding under these
circumstances.”</p>
          <p>“The examination must proceed,” was the prompt
response of the Commissioner. But Mr. Hallett, whose
offensive and unexplained presence within the bar has
already been alluded to, now joined issue, and proceeded
to harangue the Commissioner
<pb id="steve84" n="84"/>
in reply to what had been said. The Commissioner,
immediately interrupting, reminded him that, as he
had already decided the point, any further remarks
were unnecessary. The District Attorney persisted.
The conduct of the Marshal, he said, had been called
in question, and he was present to act as his counsel.
Again the Commissioner interposed: “Mr. Hallett,
these remarks are irrelevant and entirely out of order.”
But the Attorney, without even pausing in his speech,
went on with raised voice, inflamed countenance, and
increased vehemence of manner, not only to repel the
reflections that had been cast upon the Marshal, but also
to instruct the Commissioner in his own duty. Insolence
triumphed, and the Commissioner sank back in his seat
with a helpless air, until the browbeating was ended. Men
who had been wont to see the Bench treated with the
profoundest respect by the Bar, who had known Daniel
Webster bow in silence and resume his seat at the
bidding of a common pleas judge, looked on indignant
and amazed. Why was not the Attorney ordered into
instant custody? Had the Court no power to protect itself?</p>
          <p>Another incident, that occurred at a later stage of the
examination, furnished an answer to this question. In
attempting to return to the courtroom, after one of the
short recesses that were reluctantly granted, Mr. Dana,
the senior counsel for Burns, found his progress
obstructed by the bayonets of the guard. In vain he
urged his well
<pb id="steve85" n="85"/>
known relation to the prisoner; he was kept waiting
upon the stairs until it was the pleasure of the Marshal
to permit him to pass on. The outrage was made known
to the Commissioner, and he was moved to instruct the
Marshal upon the subject. “I have no authority to direct
the actions of the Marshal,” was the short but pregnant
answer, while that officer stood grimly smiling upon the
foiled advocate of Freedom. The Marshal did not sustain
the relation of a sheriff to a justiciary court; he was in no
wise amenable to the Commissioner. He might surround
the court-room with soldiery, admit or exclude whom he
pleased, subject one party in the suit to personal
outrages and bestow special indulgences on the other,
and there was no one to call him to account. The
Commissioner was not supreme in his own court. Under
this confessed state of things, the examination went
forward.</p>
          <p>The case of the claimant had already been presented,
while as yet Anthony had no one to defend him; but
now, upon the demand of his counsel, the Commissioner
ordered that the examination should commence anew.
The complaint was read by Edward G. Parker, the junior
counsel for the claimant. William Brent was then placed
upon the stand. It appeared that he was a slaveholding
grocer of Richmond, Virginia. He testified that he was the
personal friend of Col. Suttle, and had long been
acquainted with him. He had known him as a slaveholder,
and as the owner of a slave
<pb id="steve86" n="86"/>
named Anthony Burns. He had himself hired Anthony of
Suttle for three years, and had also acted as the latter's
agent in hiring him out to one Millspaugh. In this way he
had come to have intimate personal knowledge of Suttle's
ownership of Burns, and also of Burns' personal
appearance. He now stated that the prisoner was the
same Anthony Burns whom he had so well known in
Virginia. He further said that he had last seen Anthony in
that State on the twentieth of March, 1854; on the twenty-
fourth, Anthony was missing, and on the Tuesday
following, he communicated the fact to Col. Suttle, who
was then residing in Alexandria. But of the manner in
which Burns left Virginia he knew nothing.</p>
          <p>The counsel for the claimant now proposed to put in,
as evidence, the admissions which Anthony had made
since his arrest.</p>
          <p>“We object,” said Mr. Ellis; “the sixth section of the
fugitive slave law provides that the evidence of the
alleged fugitive shall not be taken.”</p>
          <p>“The admissions and confessions of Burns are a very
different thing from testimony,” replied Seth J. Thomas,
the claimant's senior counsel; “as a party in the suit—the
defendant—he is not privileged to testify.”</p>
          <p>“It is the height of cruelty to the  prisoner,” urged
Mr. Dana, “to take advantage of the only power he has
under this law—that of speech—to his detriment,
when the claimant, the other party
<pb id="steve87" n="87"/>
in the suit, has not only his own right, but, in these
alleged confessions, a portion of the prisoner's.”</p>
          <p>On the decision of this question, as the result proved,
hung the fate of Anthony Burns. Even at this early stage
of the proceedings, before the nature of the defence was
known, the important bearing of the point was discerned.
A breathless silence reigned in the court-room.</p>
          <p>“I think,” said the Commissioner, “that the word
‘testimony,’ in the law, must be regarded as referring to
evidence given by a witness, and not to confessions or
admissions; but I am unwilling to prejudice the liberty of
the prisoner, and his counsel may have the right to pass
that question for the present.”</p>
          <p>“We desire that the questions may be asked and the
answers taken down for future use, if necessary,” said
the claimant's counsel.</p>
          <p>The Court assented, and the witness proceeded to
relate the conversation that took place, as follows:
“Burns said he did not intend to run away, but being at
work on board a vessel, and getting tired, fell asleep,
when the vessel sailed with him on board. On Mr. Suttle's
going into the room after the arrest, the first word from
Burns was, ‘How do you do, Master Charles?’ The next
thing was, ‘Did I ever whip you, Anthony?’ The answer
was, ‘No.’ The next question was, ‘Did I ever hire you
where you did not want to go?’ The reply was, ‘No.’ The
next question was, ‘Did you ever ask me for money when
it was not
<pb id="steve88" n="88"/>
given you?<corr>’</corr> The answer was, ‘No.’ Mr. Suttle then asked,
‘Did I not, when you were sick, take my bed from my own
house for you?’ and the answer was, ‘Yes.’ He then
recognized me, and said, ‘How do you do, Master
William?’ Being asked substantially if he was willing to
go back, he said he was.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22">1</ref><note id="note22" n="22" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref22">1 The important discrepancies between this statement of the
conversation and that given on pp. 18, 19, chap. I., will be
apparent at a glance. That statement was taken down from 
the lips of Burns by the author of this work. Burns
emphatically denied the correctness of Brent's report of the
conversation, and declared his readiness to make oath to the
correctness of his own. As Col. Suttle stated in writing over
his own signature, after he had returned to Virginia with his
recovered property, that he continued to regard Burns as
“strictly truthful,” the reader will have at least his sanction
for believing the statement of Burns in preference to that
of Brent.</note></p>
          <p>With some further unimportant details, the examination
in chief was ended. A close cross-examination followed,
but failed to elicit any additional evidence materially
affecting the case. Throughout, the testimony of this
witness was direct and unequivocal, and was delivered
with an air of careless superiority, which was natural to a
slaveholder testifying against a slave, and was not
uncongenial to the peculiar tribunal in whose character
there was nothing to overawe.</p>
          <p>In giving in his testimony, the witness spoke of Burns
and his relatives as “slaves.” The counsel for Burns
objected to this term. “The witness must not state any
person to be a slave,” said the Commissioner, “without
corroborative legal evidence.” This instruction from the
Court caused
<pb id="steve89" n="89"/>
not a little embarrassment to the witness. The habits of a
Virginia slaveholder were inveterate upon him, and he
found it difficult to <sic corr="extemporize">extemporise</sic> forms of speech suited to
the latitude of a free state and to the ears of a free
people.</p>
          <p>One, Caleb Page, a Boston truckman, was next called
to corroborate Brent's testimony respecting the
admissions of Burns on the night of the arrest. He had
assisted in arresting the prisoner, and, according to his
own statement, was “just the man wanted” by the officer
for that business. His testimony added nothing to the
strength of the claimant's case, and he had little reason to
thank his employers for uselessly dragging him forth
from obscurity to become an object of odium to his
fellow citizens.</p>
          <p>“We now propose,” said the claimant's counsel, “to put
in the record of the court of Virginia as evidence.”</p>
          <p>“It is in the case,” said the Commissioner, “subject to
objection from counsel.”</p>
          <p>The counsel for the defence examined the record.
“We should have several objections to present against
it,” said they, “which, in the absence of a jury, we
should like to present to the Court.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23">1</ref><note id="note23" n="23" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref23">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixc">Appendix C.</ref></note></p>
          <p>“The record,” said Mr. Parker, “is decisive of two
points: first, that Burns owed service and labor, second,
that he escaped.” On the point of identity he requested
the Commissioner to examine the marks upon the
prisoner.</p>
          <pb id="steve90" n="90"/>
          <p>“I perceive,” said the <sic corr="Commissioner">Commissoner</sic>, “the scars on
the cheek and hand, and take cognizance with my eye of
the prisoner's height.” He offered to have the prisoner
brought up for a closer examination, but this was
declined.</p>
          <p>A volume of Virginia laws relative to the organization
and power of courts was presented as evidence.
Objection was made.</p>
          <p>“A <hi rend="italics">book</hi> is here presented,” said Mr. Dana, “to show
that a person owes service and labor in Virginia! We
deny the sufficiency of the evidence.”</p>
          <p>The proper way,” said the opposing counsel, “to
prove the law of another state is by books; if the book
is not sufficient, I wish to prove the fact in another way.”</p>
          <p>“Let the book go in as testimony for what it is
worth,” said the Commissioner.</p>
          <p>The evidence on the part of the claimant here closed.
The court had been in session five hours, and an
adjournment was asked for. At first, the Commissioner
refused to grant it, his anxiety to press the case to a close
overpowering all considerations of judicial decorum.
With great reluctance, he was at length persuaded to
allow a half-hour's recess to enable the prisoner's
counsel to examine authorities and make some other
necessary preparation.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref24" n="24" rend="SC" target="note24">1</ref><note id="note24" n="24" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref24">1 The greater part of this brief recess was rendered of no avail
by the obstructions which the officials and the military presented
in the way of the counsel for Burns.</note></p>
          <p>Upon the re-assembling of the court, Mr. Ellis
<pb id="steve91" n="91"/>
opened for the defence. Allowed but a single day for
preparation, denied access to the law library of the court,
obstructed and delayed in his movements by the military,
he entered upon his task under the greatest embarrassment.
He and his associate had been charged with seeking,
not a trial under, but a triumph over the law. This was
denied. “Not only,” said he, “have I never sought to resist
the law, but I have done something to stay resistance to it.
I stand here for the prisoner, under, and not against the law.”</p>
          <p>The position of the prisoner was impressively described.
“Seized on a false charge, without counsel, the prisoner
is to be doomed. And then, with no power to test
jurisdiction, when every one of the writs of the common
law for personal liberty's security is found to have failed,
without time, without food, without free access to the
court, without the show of free action or free thought
within it, without challenge for favor or bias, for cause or
without cause, without jury, without proofs in form, or
witnesses to confront him, with a judge sitting with his
hands tied, in nearly all points the merest tool of the most
monstrous of anomalies, with no power to render a
judgment, but full power to doom to the direst sentence,
I say that in all things save one—in your opinion—the
prisoner has not the semblance of justice.”</p>
          <p>It had been urged that the examination was merely
preliminary. “They know better.” replied the advocate,
“when they say so. The law looks
<pb id="steve92" n="92"/>
no further, nothing is to follow. This is the final act in the
farce of hearing. They know, we know, you know, that if
you send him hence with them, he goes to the block, to
the sugar or cotton plantation, to the lash under which I
have heard that Sims, who entered the dark portal,
breathed out his life.” Therefore he adjured the
Commissioner to refuse the certificate of surrender except
upon the most overwhelming proof.</p>
          <p>And what proof had the claimant presented? He had
called only a single witness, and had produced a written
paper which he styled a record of a Virginia court. This
evidence, the counsel alleged, was defective in many
particulars, which he pointed out; some of it was
inadmissible, and what was admissible was insufficient.
The fugitive slave act was commented upon, and several
positions were stated upon which it was claimed that act
ought to be declared unconstitutional.</p>
          <p>“For the reasons now presented,” said the advocate,
in closing his review, “the claimant shows no claim to a
certificate; and, if such a case stood alone, we feel that it
ought to be dismissed.”</p>
          <p>“But,” continued he with altered look and voice,
“the prisoner has a case of his own. The complaint
alleges, the only record offered proves, the only witness
called testifies to, an escape from Richmond on the
twenty-fourth day of March last. The witness swears
clearly and positively that he saw this prisoner in
Richmond on the twentieth day of March.</p>
          <pb id="steve93" n="93"/>
          <p>“We shall call a number of witnesses to show,—fixing,
as I think, the man and the time beyond question,—that
the prisoner was in Boston on the first of March last, and
has been here ever since up to the time of this seizure.
This is our defence.” An <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">alibi</hi></foreign> was to be proved.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref25" n="25" rend="sc" target="note25">1</ref><note id="note25" n="25" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref25">1 The word <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">alibi</hi></foreign> is the one that most nearly expresses the idea
sought to be conveyed. I am told that it is not in good odor with
the legal profession. Let it be taken without the bad odor, and the
reader will get no wrong impression.</note></p>
          <p>A colored citizen of South Boston, named William
Jones, was called upon the stand. He testified that he first
saw Burns in Washington street, Boston, on the first day
of March, 1854, and that on the fourth of the same month
he employed him to labor in the Mattapan Works at
South Boston. He was able to fix the dates by reference
to a memorandum book, in which, at his request, a certain
Mr. Russell had made an entry of the time, and which was
produced by him in court. The particularity of detail with
which this testimony was given, presented a field for
attack which the claimant's counsel did not fail to
improve. A sharp and protracted. cross-examination
followed, but it failed to shake the testimony, and, at the
end of several hours, the witness was permitted to retire
from the stand.</p>
          <p>George H. Drew, a white citizen of Boston, confirmed
the statements of the colored witness. He was the book-
keeper at the Mattapan Works, in March; knew Jones to
have been employed
<pb id="steve94" n="94"/>
there on the first of that month, and then saw Burns with
him. He had no doubt of the man's identity; and he had,
moreover, observed that on his first entering the court-room,
Burns had appeared to recognize him by following him
round the room with his eyes.</p>
          <p>James F. Whittemore, a member of the city council of
Boston, and a director of the Mattapan Works, swore
that he saw Burns there on the eighth or ninth of March,
at work with Jones. He identified the man by the scars on
his cheek and right hand, and fixed the time by reference
to his return from a journey. To a question from the
prisoner's counsel, he replied that he was an officer of the
Pulaski Guards, then under arms for the purpose of
quelling any disturbance growing out of this affair,
and that he was not a free-soiler or abolitionist, but a
hunker whig. This explanation was fitted to increase
the weight of his testimony on the public mind.</p>
          <p>Stephen Maddox, a colored clothing trader in Boston,
had seen Burns at his store in March, accompanied by
Jones. He had particularly noticed the mark on his cheek,
and was able to say that the time was about the first of
the month.</p>
          <p>William C. Culver, a blacksmith, H. N. Gilman, a
teamster, and Rufus A. Putnam, a machinist, all of whom
had been employed at the Mattapan Works in March,
testified with various degrees of particularity to having
seen the prisoner there before the middle of that month.</p>
          <pb id="steve95" n="95"/>
          <p>John Favor, a carpenter, had seen Burns, accompanied
by Jones, in his shop, some time between the first and
fifth of March, he thought; he had no doubt that the
prisoner was the man.</p>
          <p>Finally, Horace W. Brown, a police officer, testified
that, while employed as a carpenter at the Mattapan
Works, he had seen Burns at work there with Jones,
some week or ten days before he left, which was on the
twentieth of March. He had not the slightest doubt
about the man's identity.</p>
          <p>The evidence for the prisoner was closed. As it
progressed, a marked change in the countenances and
manner of the claimant and his party had gradually made
itself manifest. They had greeted the first colored witness
with a fixed stare of contemptuous incredulity; his story
they regarded as the falsehood of a perjurer, and when
the ingenuity of the counsel in cross-examining proved
no match for the negro's self-possession, they still looked
upon it as only the case of a “lie well stuck to.” The
testimony of the next witness, a respectable white citizen,
somewhat abated their lofty and assured looks; but when
one who was clothed with the double responsibilities of
civil and military office, who was at the time on duty in
the claimant's behalf, and who disavowed the character of
an abolitionist,—when this witness emphatically
confirmed the testimony previously given, all the
assurance of the claimant and his friends gave place to
unfeigned anxiety and alarm, while wonder and hope
played over the countenances of those who sympathized
<pb id="steve96" n="96"/>
with the prisoner. Witness after witness followed,
until the cumulative evidence of nine persons stood
arrayed in irreconcilable hostility against the single
testimony of Brent. It seemed beyond a question
that the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">alibi</hi></foreign> had been established.</p>
          <p>An effort was now made to destroy the force of the
evidence in behalf of the prisoner, by the introduction of
rebutting evidence. One of the witnesses, called for this
purpose, had been a keeper over Burns, from the time of
the arrest; he was expected to testify to certain
statements made by the prisoner while in his charge.
This was objected to, on the general ground that the
prisoner's admissions were not to be received at all; on
the further ground that, in this instance, they had been
made under intimidation; and finally, on the ground that
it was not rebutting testimony. Notwithstanding, the
Commissioner ruled that it should be admitted.
Accordingly, the witness proceeded to state that in
conversation with himself, during the period of arrest,
Burns had said that he had been in Boston about two
months, and that previously he had been in Richmond,
Virginia. With this piece of evidence from a hireling of
the slaveholder, the testimony on both sides was closed.</p>

          <head>THE ARGUMENTS.</head>
          <p>AMIDST the deepest silence, Richard H. Dana, Jr., rose
to make the closing argument for the prisoner. The son
of one of America's most eminent poets, the grandson of
a Chief Justice of Massachusetts, he was less indebted
to ancestral fame for the high position which he at the
time enjoyed, than to his own genius and industry.
Compelled, while a member of the University, to
abandon the pursuit of science for the pursuit of health,
he had shipped before the mast on board a vessel bound
to the then almost uninhabited coast of California, for a
cargo of raw hides. In this situation, sharing in all the
perils and toils and pleasures of the common sailor, on
ship and on shore, now out upon a yard-arm reefing
sails in a tempest, now on land, day after day, bending
beneath a load of filthy hides, he underwent an
experience which would have rendered a coarse nature
only coarser, but which, transmuted and improved by
his finer nature, and afterwards given to the world in the
celebrated and fascinating “Two Years Before the
Mast,” became the foundation of his future fortunes.
Elected a member of the Convention for
<pb id="steve98" n="98"/>
revising the Constitution of Massachusetts in 1853, he
there quickly distinguished himself, and by universal
consent took his place in the first rank of that eminent
body. He was now, by his generous and powerful
defence of the oppressed, about to earn fresh laurels for
his brow.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26">1</ref><note id="note26" n="26" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref26">1 Two purses, of $200 each, were made up by the Committee of
Vigilance, and tendered to Messrs. Dana and Ellis, but the service
had been given from love of the cause, and the money was
declined. Subsequently, pieces of silver plate, with suitable
inscriptions, were presented to each gentleman by the same
parties.</note> Of moderate temper, of conservative principles,
of charitable judgment, he yet felt impelled, by the
unparalleled circumstances of the occasion, to preface his
argument with an exordium so stinging and intolerable in
its truth, that the miscreants at whom it was levelled, and
upon whose ears it fell, glutted their revenge, not long
after, by waylaying him in the street at night and felling
him to the ground.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref27" n="27" rend="sc" target="note27">2</ref><note id="note27" n="27" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref27">2 One of them was arrested and put under bonds to appear for
trial, but before the appointed time he fled to New Orleans. His
bondsmen, irritated at his want of good faith, procured a
requisition from Governor Washburn upon the Governor of
Louisiana, and sent an officer in pursuit. He was apprehended,
brought back, tried, and sentenced to hard labor for a term of
years in the State Prison.</note> Widely circulated in the papers of the
day, it deserves a place upon the permanent page of
history.</p>
          <p>“I congratulate you, Sir,” said he, “that your labors,
so anxious and painful, are drawing to a close. I
congratulate the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that
she is to be relieved from that incubus
<pb id="steve99" n="99"/>
which has rested on her for so many days and
nights, making her to dream strange dreams and see
strange visions. I congratulate her that at length, in due
time, by leave of the Marshal of the United States, and
the District Attorney of the United States, first had and
obtained therefor, her courts may be re-opened, and her
judges, suitors, and witnesses may pass and repass
without being obliged to satisfy hirelings of the United
States Marshal and bayonetted foreigners, clothed in the
uniform of our army and navy, that they have a right to
be there. I congratulate the city of Boston that her peace
here is no longer to be in danger. Yet I cannot but admit
that while her peace here is in some danger, the peace of
all other parts of the city has never been so safe as while
the Marshal has had his posse of specials in this Court
House. Why, Sir, people have not felt it necessary to lock
their doors at night, the brothels are tenanted only by
women, fighting-dogs and racing-horses have been
unemployed, and Ann street and its alleys and cellars
show signs of a coming millennium.</p>
          <p>“I congratulate, too, the Government of the United
States, that its legal representative can return to his
appropriate duties, and that his sedulous presence will
no longer be needed here in a private civil suit for the
purpose of intimidation, a purpose which his effort the
day before yesterday showed every desire to effect,
which although it did not influence this Court in the
least, I deeply
<pb id="steve100" n="100"/>
regret that your Honor did not put down at once, and
bring to bear upon him the judicial power of this tribunal.
I congratulate the Marshal of the United States that the
ordinary respectability of his character is no longer to be
in danger from the character of the associates he is
obliged to call about him. I congratulate the officers of
the army and navy that they can be relieved from this
service, which as gentlemen and soldiers surely they
despise, and can draw off their non-commissioned
officers and privates, both drunk and sober, from this
fortified slave-pen to the custody of the forts and fleets
of our country, which have been left in peril, that this
great Republic might add to its glories the trophies of
one more captured slave.”</p>
          <p>With this introduction, Mr. Dana proceeded to his
argument. The Commissioner had declared in the outset
that he should presume the prisoner to be a freeman until
he was proved a slave. To this declaration Mr. Dana held
the Court. Upon it he rested his hopes. It was for the
claimant, therefore, to furnish evidence that the prisoner
was his slave. He had described a certain slave
belonging to him—was the prisoner that slave? This was
a question of identity. But on the point of identity men
were liable to be mistaken—actually <hi rend="italics">had</hi> been mistaken.
Jacob had been mistaken for Esau by his own father. The
history of slave-catching furnished examples of terrible
mistakes of this sort. A freeman named Gibson had been
remanded from Philadelphia to Maryland as a slave.
Another
<pb id="steve101" n="101"/>
named Freeman had been sent into slavery from Indiana.
With such impressive instances on record, it was all
important to guard against any mistake. What evidence
of identity in this case had Suttle furnished? First and
chiefly, there was Brent's testimony. But Brent had not
been favorably situated for identifying Burns. Then, the
description in the record was relied upon; but the
description was loose, and the record itself was
probably nothing but Brent on paper. It was further said,
that Brent's liability to bias as a Virginian should be taken
into consideration.</p>
          <p>“But,” continued Mr. Dana, “there is fortunately one
fact of which Mr. Brent is sure. He knows that he saw
this Anthony Burns in Richmond, Virginia, on the
twentieth day of March last, and that he disappeared
from there on the twenty-fourth. To this fact he testified
unequivocally. After all the evidence is put in on our side
to show that the prisoner was in Boston on the first and
fifth of March, he does not go back to the stand to
correct an error, or to say that he may have been
mistaken, or that he only meant to say that it was <hi rend="italics">about</hi>
the twentieth or twenty-fourth. He persists in his positive
testimony, and I have no doubt that he is right and
honest in doing so. He did see Anthony Burns in
Richmond, Virginia, on the twentieth day of March, and
Anthony Burns was first missing from there on the
twenty-fourth. But the prisoner was in Boston, earning
an honest livelihood by the work of his hands, through
the active month of
<pb id="steve102" n="102"/>
March, from the first day forward. Of this your
Honor cannot, on the proofs, entertain a reasonable
doubt.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Dana proceeded to review the testimony introduced
by the defence on this point. The principal witness was
Jones. He had sworn with great particularity of detail
that the prisoner was seen by him in Boston on the
first day of March, and was at work with him in his
employ on the fifth and eighteenth of the same month,
in the same city. He could not be mistaken respecting
the man's identity. This testimony was vital, and
was either the truth, or a pure fabrication. “I saw
at once,” said Mr. Dana, “as every one must have
seen, that the story so full of details, with such
minuteness of names, and dates, and places, must
either stand impregnable, or be shattered to pieces.
The severest test has been applied. The other
side has had a day in which to follow up the
points of Jones's diary, and discover his errors and
falsehoods. But he is corroborated in every point.”</p>
          <p>Having passed in review the testimony of the other
witnesses confirming that of Jones, the advocate
proceeded to set forth the cumulative effect of such an
array of witnesses. “On a question of identity” said he,
“numbers are everything. One man may mistake by
accident, design, or bias. His sight may be poor, his
observation imperfect, his opportunities slight, his
recollection of faces not vivid. But if six or eight men
agree on identity, the evidence has more than six or
eight times
<pb id="steve103" n="103"/>
the force of one man's opinion. Each man has his own
mode and means and habits of observation and
recollection. One observes one thing, and another
another thing. One makes this combination and
association, and another that. One sees him in one light,
or expression, or position, or action, and another in
another. One remembers a look, another a tone, another
the gait, another the gesture. Now if a considerable
number of these independent observers combine upon
the same man, the chances of mistake are lessened to an
indefinite degree. What other man could answer so many
conditions presented in such various ways? On the point
of the time and the place, too, each of those witnesses is
an independent observer. These are not links in one
chain, each depending on another. They are separate
rays, from separate sources, uniting on one point.”</p>
          <p>In concluding this. part of his argument, Mr. Dana
inquired: “If the burden of proof had been upon us,
should we not have met it? How much more, then,
are we entitled to prevail where we have only to
shake the claimant's case by showing that it is left
in reasonable doubt?”</p>
          <p>A new and independent line of argument was now
taken. “Throw out,” said Mr. Dana, “all of our
testimony and rest the case on the claimant's evidence
alone.” Two questions were to be met: Did the prisoner
owe service to Suttle? Did he escape from Virginia into
Massachusetts? The claimant offered the record of the
Virginia Court
<pb id="steve104" n="104"/>
as conclusive on both these points. It was agreed that
such would be its effect if the proper mode of proceeding
was adopted. The fugitive slave act provided two
methods. By the tenth section the questions of slavery
and escape were to be tried ex parte, in the state from
which the person escaped; and the record of this was to
be conclusive. By the sixth section, the same questions
might be tried in the state where the escaping person was
found. These were distinct, independent methods, and
the claimant was at liberty to proceed under either. He
had, however, proceeded under both; he had attempted
to prove the facts of slavery and escape by parole and
other evidence before the Commissioner, and he had also
offered the Virginia record as conclusive of the same
facts. But this was inadmissible. The two methods could
not be thus combined . The structure of the statute
plainly implied the reverse. Having elected to proceed
under the sixth section, the claimant was no longer at
liberty to introduce his record under the tenth.</p>
          <p>But, if the record were considered as admissible in
other respects, and conclusive if admitted, it was still
objectionable both in form and substance. It did not
purport to be a record of the matters proved. It did not
describe the person with such convenient certainty as
might be. It did not allege that he escaped into another
state. “On one or more of these points,” said Mr. Dana,
“we have great confidence that the record will be
excluded, or that, if
<pb id="steve105" n="105"/>
admitted, we may control it by the claimant's own
testimony.”</p>
          <p>One part of the testimony showed that Burns, at the
time of his <hi rend="italics">escape,</hi> owed service, not to Suttle, but to
Millspaugh. He was leased to Millspaugh. This was in flat
contradiction to the record. What right then had Suttle to
claim Burns? Until the lease expired, Millspaugh had the
sole right of possession and control. “Mr. Millspaugh,”
argued Mr. Dana, “may allow him to come to
Massachusetts and stay here until the end of the lease, if
he chooses. Col. Suttle has nothing to say about it.” But
this was not all. The testimony of Brent showed that
Burns had been mortgaged, and there was no evidence
before the Commissioner that the mortgage bad been
discharged. On this ground, also, Suttle was precluded
from interfering.</p>
          <p>An essential element in the claimant's case was the
escape. Had there been any escape? There was no
evidence of the fact. To constitute an escape, two things
must concur: that the person came away, first, of his own
will, and second, against his master's will. The claimant
had introduced evidence showing that Burns had not
escaped of his own will; and by that evidence he was
bound. Respecting Millspaugh, his master for the time,
and the only person having a right at the time to say
whether he should go or come, no evidence at all had
been introduced. A case of escape, then, had not been
made out, and as, by the decisions of the Courts, the
<hi rend="italics">escape</hi> is the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">casus faederis</hi></foreign> under the
<pb id="steve106" n="106"/>
constitution, the prisoner could not rightfully be sent
back to Virginia.</p>
          <p>The admissions of Burns were last considered. They
were made under extraordinary circumstances. The
prisoner was overwhelmed with terror. They rested on
the evidence of a single witness testifying under the
strongest bias, and who, in regard to one part of the
admissions which he swore to, had been proved to have
been mistaken. But, under any circumstances, the
Commissioner should have ruled them out. Reason,
humanity, and precedent, required that they should not
be received.</p>
          <p>On the constitutional question, Mr. Dana said he
should offer the propositions in the same form in which
they were cast by Mr. Rantoul in the <hi rend="italics">Sims' case,</hi> and not
argue them at all, putting them forward as a continued
protest:</p>
          <p>I. That the power which the Commissioner is called
upon in this procedure to exercise is a judicial power, and
one that, if otherwise lawful, can be exercised only by a
judge of the United States Court, duly appointed, and
that the Commissioner is not such a judge.</p>
          <p>II. That the procedure is a suit between the claimant
and captive, involving an alleged right of property on the
one hand, and the right of personal liberty on the other,
and that either party, therefore, is entitled to trial by jury;
and the law which purports to authorize a delivery of the
captive to the claimant, denying him the privilege of such
a trial, 
<pb id="steve107" n="107"/>
and which he here claims under judicial process, is
unconstitutional and void.</p>
          <p>III.  That the transcript of testimony taken before the
magistrates of a state court in Georgia, and of the
judgment thereupon by such magistrates, is incompetent
evidence, Congress having no power to confer upon
state courts or magistrates judicial authority to
determine, conclusively or otherwise, upon the effect
of evidence to be used in a suit pending or to be tried
in another state, or before another tribunal.</p>
          <p>IV. That such evidence is also incompetent, because
the captive was not represented at the taking
thereof, and had no opportunity for cross-examination.</p>
          <p>V. That the statute under which the process is
instituted is unconstitutional and void, as not within the
power granted to Congress by the Constitution, and
because it is opposed to the express provisions thereof.</p>
          <p>Mr. Dana closed with an impressive appeal to the
Commissioner. “You recognized, Sir,” said he, “in the
beginning, the presumption of freedom. Hold to it now,
Sir, as to the sheet anchor of your own peace of mind,
as well as of the prisoner's safety. If you make a mistake
in favor of the prisoner, a pecuniary value, not great,
is put at hazard. If against him, a free man is made a
slave. If you have, on the evidence or on the law,
the doubt of a reasoning and reasonable mind, an
intelligent misgiving, then, Sir, I implore you, in
<pb id="steve108" n="108"/>
view of the cruel character of this law, in view of the
dreadful consequences of a mistake, send him not away
with that tremendous doubt on your mind. It may turn to
a torturing certainty. The eyes of many millions are upon
you, Sir. You are to do an act which will hold its place in
the history of America, in the history of the progress of
the human race. May your judgment be for liberty and
not for slavery; for happiness and not for wretchedness;
for hope and not for despair: and may the blessing of him
that is ready to perish come upon you.”</p>
          <p>Seth J. Thomas closed the case for the claimant. After
a congratulatory exordium, confessedly in imitation of
Mr. Dana's, he proceeded as follows:</p>
          <p>“The claimant in this case, Charles F. Suttle, says he is
of Alexandria, in the state of Virginia; that, under the laws
of that state, he held to service and labor one Anthony
Burns, a colored man; that, on or about the twenty-fourth
day of March last, while so held to service by him, the
said Anthony escaped from the said state of Virginia, and
that he is now here in court. He prays you (the
Commissioner) to hear and consider his proofs in support
of this his claim, and, if they satisfactorily support it, that
you will certify to him, under your hand and seal, that he
has a right to transport him back to Virginia. This is his
whole case; this is all that he asks you to do. Under your
certificate, he may take him back to the place from whence
he fled; and he can in virtue of that take him no where
else.</p>
          <pb id="steve109" n="109"/>
          <p>“Now, to entitle the claimant to this certificate, what
must he prove? Two things. First, that Burns owed
service and labor to him, the claimant. Second, that he
escaped. How is he to prove these? The statute answers.
He may apply to any court of record in Virginia, or
judge thereof in vacation, and make satisfactory proof
to such court or judge that Burns owes service or labor
to him, and that he escaped. The court shall then cause
a record to be made of the matter so proved, and also
a general description of the person, with such convenient
certainty as may be; and a transcript of such record,
authenticated by the attestation of the seal of the court,
being produced here where the person is found, and
being exhibited to you, is to be taken by you as conclusive
of the facts of escape and of service due. And upon the
production by the claimant of other and further
evidence, if necessary, in respect to the identity of the
person escaping, he is to be delivered up to the claimant,
with a certificate of his right to take him back; or his
claim may be heard upon other satisfactory proofs
competent in law.</p>
          <p>“Such are the requirements. How have we met them?
We have put in the transcript of a record. It is duly
authenticated, and is conclusive upon the court of the
two facts therein recited viz., that the claimant held one
Anthony Burns to service or labor, and that he escaped.
These two facts .are not open here. Then the question
remains, is the person at the bar, Anthony Burns,
<pb id="steve110" n="110"/>
as he is called,—nobody thinks of calling him anything
else,—is he the Anthony Burns named in the record?
If he is, there is an end of the case. The claim is made
out and the certificate must follow. This, with simple
proof of identity, would have been all that, in an ordinary
case, counsel would have deemed it necessary to do.”</p>
          <p>But this was an extraordinary case; and Mr. Thomas
proceeded to say that, in addition to the record and proof
of identity, be had deemed it proper to put in the
testimony of Brent, and the admissions of Burns. As to
the question of identity, there was the description in the
record. This had been objected to by the opposing
counsel as being loose, general in its terms, and defective
in important particulars.  Mr. Thomas contended that it
was sufficiently exact to warrant its exclusive application
to the prisoner.</p>
          <p>He next considered the array of testimony presented
by the defence to prove that Burns was in
Massachusetts during the whole month of March, and
that consequently Brent's story could not be true. The
leading witness was Jones, the colored man. His
testimony was disposed of by the attorney's simple
declaration that it was “a story manufactured for the
case.” But there were seven other witnesses who had
corroborated that “story.” These were disposed of in an
equally summary manner. “Jones,” said the claimant's
counsel, “went to them and asked them if they did not
remember the man he had with him cleaning the
<pb id="steve111" n="111"/>
windows [at the Mattapan Works], told them this was
the man, impressed them with this fact. They came into
court with this impression, and made up their minds that
he was.”</p>
          <p>Having thus insisted that the unimpeached testimony
for the defence was based upon combined falsehood and
delusion, he proceeded by implication to admit its truth.
Its force was too great, apparently, even for himself.
“Brent,” said he, “ may possibly be mistaken as to the
date.” But, the date was not material after all. “A crime of
a high nature even may be charged to have been done on
the twenty-fourth of March, and proved to have been
done on the twenty-fourth of February.” Brent could not
be mistaken as to the identity. But there was something
stronger still—the prisoner's own admissions. Even if
it were possible for Brent to be mistaken on the point
of identity, such a mistake on the prisoner's part was
not possible, and he had admitted that he was Suttle's
slave.</p>
          <p>The counsel for the defence had contended that, if
Anthony owed service at all, it was not to Suttle but to
Millspaugh. “If he is the man described,” said Mr.
Thomas, “that is not open to inquiry. It had been said
that under the Commissioner's certificate Anthony might
be carried, not to Virginia, but to Cuba or Brazil. They do
not tell us how,” replied Mr. Thomas. “If he is carried to
Cuba, it will not be by your certificate.” It had been said
that the certificate would send him into
<pb id="steve112" n="112"/>
eternal bondage. “It is enough to say,” replied Mr.
Thomas, “that it will send him to Virginia whence he
came. When he gets there, he will have the same rights
that he had before he came here. If that State don't
sufficiently guard his rights, the fault is not yours nor
mine.” It had been said that the fugitive slave law was
unconstitutional. But, replied Mr. Thomas, it has been
held to be constitutional by the Supreme Court of
Massachusetts, and by every judge before whom a case
under it has arisen.</p>
          <p>“It remains only,” said Mr. Thomas, “that I
recapitulate the points already stated. The record is
conclusive of two facts, that the person owed service,
and that he escaped. That record, with the testimony of
Brent and the admissions of Burns, proves the identity. I
take leave of the case, confident in the proofs presented,
confident in the majesty of the law, and confident that
the determination here will be just.”</p>
          <p>At the conclusion of Mr. Thomas's argument, the
court was adjourned until Friday morning, the second of
June.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
          <head>THE DECISION.</head>
          <p>DURING Thursday, June first, the popular excitement
visibly abated. The unexpected testimony in behalf of
Burns had produced a general persuasion that the
Commissioner's decision would be made in his favor, and
the bare anticipation of this had contributed not a little to
compose the public mind. A single incident, however,
pointed with ominous certainty to a different result; Early
on Friday morning, Burns was presented with a complete
new suit of clothes by Butman and the others who had
assisted at his capture, A foreknowledge of his
impending fate had betrayed them into an act of
generosity which would never have been performed, had
they believed that he would be suffered to remain on the
soil where he had been honestly earning as much,
probably, as any of themselves. They imitated the
ancient priests by adorning the victim whom they were
about to sacrifice.</p>
          <p>Arrayed in this holiday garb, Burns was conducted for
the last time into the United States court-room. Since
Wednesday night, a double guard had been placed over
him, and they now attended
<pb id="steve114" n="114"/>
him to the dock. Increased precautionary
measures besides had been provided by the Marshal.
Soldiers with fixed bayonets filled all the avenues, and
bullies armed with bludgeons and pistols crowded the
court-room. One at a time, members of the bar, reporters
for the press, friends of the prisoner, and favored
citizens, defiled beneath crossed bayonets and occupied
their places.</p>
          <p>At nine o'clock, Commissioner Loring took his seat
upon the bench. His countenance wore a haggard and
jaded aspect, his port and bearing were not those of a
judge clear in his great office. Hardly glancing at the
assembly before him, amidst profound stillness he
immediately began to read his decision. It was in the
following words:</p>
          <div3 type="section">
            <head>THE DECISION.</head>
            <p>“The issue between the parties arises under the
United States statute of 1850, and for the respondent it is
urged that the statute is unconstitutional. Whenever this
objection is made, it becomes necessary to recur to the
purpose of the statute. It purports to carry into execution
the provision of the Constitution, which provides for the
extradition of persons held to service or labor in one
state, and escaping to another. It is applicable, and it is
applied alike to bond and free, to the apprentice and the
slave; and in reference to both, its purpose, provisions,
and processes are the same.</p>
            <p>“The arrest of the fugitive is a ministerial and not a
judicial act, and the nature of the act is not
<pb id="steve115" n="115"/>
altered by the means employed for its accomplishment.
When an officer arrests a fugitive from justice, or a party
accused, the officer must determine the identity, and use
his discretion and information for the purpose. When an
arrest is made under this statute, the means of
determining the identity are prescribed by the statute;
but when the means are used and the act is done, it is
still a ministerial act. The statute only substitutes the
means it provides, for the discretion of an arresting
officer, and thus gives to the fugitive from service a much
better protection than a fugitive from justice can claim
under any law.</p>
            <p>“If extradition is the only purpose of the statute,
and the determination of the identity is the only
purpose of these proceedings under it, it seems to
me that the objection of unconstitutionality to the
statute, because it does not furnish a jury trial to
the fugitive, is answered; there is no provision in
the Constitution requiring that the <hi rend="italics">identity</hi> of the
person to be arrested should be determined by a
jury. It has never been claimed for apprentices or
fugitives from justice, and if it does not belong to
them, it does not belong to the respondent.</p>
            <p>“And if extradition is a ministerial act, to substitute,
in its performance, for the discretion of an arresting
officer, the discretion of a Commissioner instructed by
testimony under oath, seems scarcely to reach to a grant
of judicial power, within the meaning of the United States
Constitution. And it is certain that if the power given to,
and used
<pb id="steve116" n="116"/>
by, the Commissioner of United States Courts under the
statute is unconstitutional, then so was the power given
to, and used by, magistrates of counties, cities and
towns, and used by the act of 1793. These all were
Commissioners of the United States; the powers they
used under the statute, were not derived from the laws of
their respective states, but from the statute of the United
States. They were commissioned by that, and that alone.
They were commissioned by the class instead of
individually and by name, and in this respect the only
difference that I can see between the acts of 1793 and
1850, is, that the latter reduced the number of appointees,
and confined the appointment to those who, by their
professional standing, should be competent to the
performance of their duties, and who bring to them the
certificates of the highest judicial tribunals of the land.</p>
            <p>“It is said the statute is unconstitutional, because it
gives to the record of the court of Virginia an effect
beyond its constitutional effect. The first section of the
fourth article of the Constitution is directory only on the
State power, and as to the State courts, and does not
seek to limit the control of Congress over the tribunals
of the United States or the proceedings therein. Then in
that article the term, ‘records and judicial proceedings,’
refers to such <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">inter partes,</hi></foreign> and of necessity can have
no application to proceedings avowedly <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ex parte.</hi></foreign> Then
if the first section includes this record, it expressly
declares as to
<pb id="steve117" n="117"/>
‘records and judicial proceedings’ that Congress shall
prescribe ‘the effect thereof,’ and this express power
would seem to be precisely the power that Congress has
used in the statute of 1850.</p>
            <p>“Other constitutional objections have been urged
here, which have been adjudged and re-adjudged by the
Courts of the United States, and of many of the states;
and the decisions of these tribunals absolve me from
considering the same questions further than to apply to
them the determination of the Supreme Court of this state
in Sims' case, 7 Cushing 309, that they ‘are settled by a
course of legal decisions which we are bound to respect,
and which we regard as binding and conclusive on this
Court.’</p>
            <p>“But a special objection has been raised to the record
that it describes the escape as from the State of Virginia,
and omits to describe it as into another State, in the
words and substance of the Constitution. But in this the
record follows the tenth section of the statute of 1850,
and the context of the section confines its action to
cases of escape from one state, &amp;c., into another, and is
therefore in practical action and extent strictly
conformable to the Constitution.</p>
            <p>“This statute has been decided to be constitutional
by the unanimous opinion of the Judges of the Supreme
Court of Massachusetts on the fullest argument and
maturest deliberation, and to be the law of
Massachusetts, as well as, and because it is a
constitutional law of the United States; and
<pb id="steve118" n="118"/>
the wise words of our revered Chief Justice in that case, 7
Cushing, 318, may well be repeated now, and remembered
always. The Chief Justice says:</p>
            <p>“ ‘Slavery was not created, established, or perpetuated,
by the Constitution; it existed before; it would have
existed if the Constitution had not been made. The framers
of the Constitution could not abrogate slavery, or the
rights claimed under it. They took it as they found it, and
regulated it to a limited extent. The Constitution, therefore,
is not responsible for the origin or continuance of slavery;
the provision it contains was the best adjustment which
could be made of conflicting rights and claims, and was
absolutely necessary to effect what may now be
considered as the general pacification, by which harmony
and peace should take the place of violence and war.
These were the circumstances, and this the spirit, in which
the Constitution was made; the regulation of slavery, so
far as to prohibit States by law from harboring fugitive
slaves, was an essential element in its formation, and the
Union intended to be established by it was essentially
necessary to the peace, happiness, and highest prosperity
of all the States. In this spirit, and with these views
steadily in prospect, it seems to be the duty of all judges
and magistrates to expound and apply these provisions in
the Constitution and laws of the United States, and in this
spirit it behoves all persons bound to obey the laws of the
United States, to consider and regard them.’</p>
            <pb id="steve119" n="119"/>
            <p>“It is said that the statute, if constitutional, is wicked
and cruel. The like charges were brought against the act
of 1793; and Chief Justice Parker, of Massachusetts,
made the answer which Chief Justice Shaw cites and
approves, viz :—‘Whether the statute is a harsh one or
not, it is not for us to determine.’</p>
            <p>“It is said that the statute is so cruel and wicked that
it should not be executed by good men. Then into what
hands shall its administration fall, and in its
administration, what is to be the protection of the
unfortunate men who are brought within its operation?
Will those who call the statute merciless, commit it to a
merciless judge?</p>
            <p>“If the statute involves that right, which for us makes
life sweet, and the want of which makes life a misfortune,
shall its administration be confined to those who are
reckless of that right to others, or ignorant or careless of
the means given for its legal defence, or dishonest in their
use? If any men wish this, they are more cruel and wicked
than the statute, for they would strip from the fugitive the
best security and every alleviation the statute leaves him.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref28" n="28" rend="sc" target="note28">1</ref><note id="note28" n="28" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref28">1 The reasoning in these two paragraphs presents one of the
most remarkable instances of moral obliquity on record. The
assertion is, that a certain statute is so wicked that good men
ought not to execute it. Judge Loring, on the other hand, says
that good men are the very persons to execute it. Of course
they are so to execute it as either to promote or to defeat its
true intent. Judge Loring will certainly say that they should
execute it after the former method. That is, good men are to
engage deliberately, and under oath, in promoting a wicked
design!</note></p>
            <pb id="steve120" n="120"/>
            <p>“I think the statute constitutional, and it remains for
me now to apply it to the facts of the case. The facts
to be proved by the claimant are three:</p>
            <p>“First, That Anthony Burns owed him service in
Virginia. Second, That Anthony Burns escaped from that
service. These facts he has proved by the record which
the statute, section tenth, declares ‘shall be held and
taken to be full and <hi rend="italics">conclusive</hi> evidence of the fact of
escape, and that the service or labor of the person
escaping is due to the party in such record mentioned.’
Thus these two facts are removed entirely and absolutely
from my jurisdiction, and I am entirely and absolutely
precluded from applying evidence to them. If, therefore,
there is in the case evidence capable of such application, I
cannot make it.</p>
            <p>“The third fact is, the identity of the party before me
with the Anthony Burns mentioned in the record.</p>
            <p>“This identity is the only question I have a right to
consider. To this, and to this alone, I am to apply the
evidence; and the question whether the respondent was
in Virginia or Massachusetts at a certain time, is material
only as it is evidence on the point of identity. So the
parties have used it, and the testimony of the complainant
being that the Anthony Burns of the record was in
Virginia on the nineteenth of March last, the evidence of
the respondent has been offered to show that he was in
Massachusetts on or about the first of March last, and
thereafter till now.</p>
            <pb id="steve121" n="121"/>
            <p>“The testimony of the claimant is from a single
Witness, and he standing in circumstances that would
necessarily bias the fairest mind; but other imputation
than this has not been offered against him, and, from
anything that has appeared before me, cannot be. His
means of knowledge are personal, direct, and qualify him
to testify confidently, and he has done so.</p>
            <p>“The testimony on the part of the respondent is from
many witnesses whose integrity is admitted, and to
whom no imputation of bias can be attached by the
evidence in the case, and whose means of knowledge are
personal and direct, but in my opinion less full and
complete than that of Mr. Brent.</p>
            <p>“Then, between the testimony of the claimant and
respondent there is a conflict, complete and
irreconcilable. The question of identity on such a conflict
of testimony is not unprecedented nor uncommon in
judicial proceedings, and the trial of Dr. Webster
furnished a memorable instance of it.</p>
            <p>“The question now is, whether there is other evidence
in this case which will determine this conflict. In every
case of disputed identity there is one person, always,
whose knowledge is perfect and positive, and whose
evidence is not within the reach of error; and that is the
person whose identity is questioned, and such evidence
this case affords. The evidence is of the conversation
which took place between Burns and the claimant on the
night of the arrest.</p>
            <pb id="steve122" n="122"/>
            <p>“When the claimant entered the room where Burns
was, Burns saluted him, and by his <hi rend="italics">Christian</hi> name:—
‘How do you do, Master <hi rend="italics">Charles?’</hi> He saluted Mr. Brent
also, and by his <hi rend="italics">Christian</hi> name:—‘How do you do,
Master William?’ (To the appellation ‘Master’ I give no
weight.)</p>
            <p>“Colonel Suttle said,—‘How came you here?’ Burns
said an accident had happened to him; that he was
working down at Roberts’, on board a vessel, got tired
and went to sleep, and was carried off in the vessel.
‘Anthony, did I ever whip you?’—‘No, sir.’—‘Did I ever hire
you out where you did not wish to 
go?’—‘No, sir.’—‘Have 
you ever asked me for money when I did not give it
to you?’—‘No, sir.’—‘When 
you were sick, did I not
prepare you a bed in my own house and put you upon it
and nurse you?’—‘Yes, sir.’ 
Something was said about
going back. He was asked if he was willing to go back,
and he said, ‘Yes, he was.’</p>
            <p>“This was the testimony of Mr. Brent. That a
conversation took place, was confirmed by the testimony
of Caleb Page, who was present, and added the remark,
that Burns said he did not come in Capt. Snow's vessel.
The cross-examination of Brent showed that Col. Suttle
said, ‘I make you no promises and I make you no
threats.’</p>
            <p>“To me this evidence, when applied to the question
of identity, confirms and establishes the testimony of Mr.
Brent in its conflict with that offered on the part of the
respondent; and then, on the whole testimony, my mind
is satisfied beyond a
<pb id="steve123" n="123"/>
reasonable doubt of the identity of the respondent with
the Anthony Burns named in the record.</p>
            <p>“It was objected that this conversation was in the
nature of admissions, and that too of a man stupefied by
circumstances and fear, and these considerations would
have weight had the admissions been used to establish
the truth of the matters to which they referred, i. e., the
usage, the giving of money, nursing, &amp;c.; but they were
used for no such purpose, but only as evidence in
reference to identity. Had they been procured by hope or
fear they would have been inadmissible; but of that I
considered there was no evidence.</p>
            <p>“On the law and facts of the case, I consider the
claimant entitled to the certificate from me which he
claims.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29">1</ref><note id="note29" n="29" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref29">1 Shortly after the rendition of Burns, an article was published in
the Boston Atlas, entitled, “The Decision which Judge Loring
might have given.” It has since been acknowledged by Richard H.
Dana, Jr., to be his production. The reader will find it worth while
to compare it with Judge Loring's actual decision. See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixd">Appendix
D.</ref></note></p>
            <p>The Commissioner folded his manuscript and prepared
to take his departure. But the auditors remained in their
places, and for some moments the dead silence continued
unbroken. Then, as at a funeral, one and another went
quietly to Burns, whispered a word of sympathy, and
bade him farewell; and gradually, the court-room was
vacated by all but the Marshal, his aids, and the prisoner.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
          <head>THE SURRENDER.</head>
          <p>BEFORE ten o'clock the decision had been pronounced.
The act of rendition alone remained to be accomplished. It
was the most momentous part of the whole transaction. In
a community proverbially devoted to law and order, it had
become perilous to attempt the execution of such a
judicial sentence. The fact that a similar sentence had
once before been executed in the same community, so far
from making a repetition of the act more easy, only made
it more difficult. But the difficulties had been
immeasurably increased by the passage of the Nebraska
Bill. All through the winter and spring, the people of
Massachusetts had been kept at fever heat by the debates
in Congress upon that daring and Union-shattering
measure. While the trial of Burns was going on,
came the news of its passage through both Houses.
On the day before his extradition, the telegraph announced
that the bill had received the President's signature,
and had become the supreme law of the land. At such a
juncture, the thrice and four times odious fugitive slave
law had demanded another victim. It seemed like
adding insult to
<pb id="steve125" n="125"/>
injury. At the moment, many regarded the arrest of Burns
as a thing arranged by the Federal Government for the
express purpose of showing to the country that not even
the passage of the Nebraska Bill would prevent the
execution of the slave law.</p>
          <p>Excited by this state of things, the people had
thronged to the trial of Burns in an unexampled manner.
They came, not from Boston only, nor from suburban
towns only, but from distant cities and villages of
Massachusetts.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref30" n="30" rend="sc" target="note30">1</ref><note id="note30" n="30" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref30">1 Six or seven hundred went down in a body from the city of
Worcester, distant forty-four miles from Boston. Many of them
were men from the machine-shops and factories, whom no
ordinary motive would have led to forsake their business.</note>  Day after day, during the week of the
trial, the Square around the Court House had been filled
by the throng; but on the last day, and when it became
known that the prisoner was to be sent back, the mass of
spectators was swollen to such an extent that the
previous multitude seemed as nothing in comparison. Of
this countless number, an overwhelming majority were
bitterly hostile to the execution of the law; many had
sworn that it should not be executed on that day. In the
face of such a formidable popular demonstration, it now
became the duty of the federal officers to remove the
prisoner, a third of a mile, from the Court House to the
vessel lying at the wharf.</p>
          <p>There were two distinct objects to be accomplished,—the
removal of the prisoner, and the preservation
<pb id="steve126" n="126"/>
of the peace of the city. The charge of the former
devolved upon the United States Marshal, that of the latter
upon the Mayor of Boston. But there was danger of
confounding the two objects; special care was needed to
provide that, under the guise of protecting the city, the
Mayor's force should not be implicated in the act of
rendition. The crisis called for a magistrate who fully
understood the limits of his official duty and possessed
firmness enough to maintain his position. Unfortunately,
the Mayor's chair was at this time occupied by one whose
qualifications, natural and acquired, but ill prepared him to
cope with the difficulties of his situation. Bred a physician,
and transferred at once from the routine of a practitioner to
the chief magistracy of the city, Mayor Smith had neither
that intimate knowledge of his legal responsibilities which
the crisis demanded, nor that firmness of character which
would enable him to maintain a consistent course. In the
outset, he had committed himself to the Faneuil Hall
meeting. When the time for holding that meeting arrived,
he excused himself from personally attending it, but
authorized assurances to be given of his hearty sympathy.
When consulted by his policemen, on the morning after
the riot, he informed them that they were to render no aid
to the Marshal in the rendition of Burns. Beginning thus
on the side of the people, he yet ended by involving
himself, the police of Boston, and the military of
<pb id="steve127" n="127"/>
the Commonwealth, in the task of carrying into execution
the fugitive slave act.</p>
          <p>The arrangements were concerted and dictated by
Benjamin F. Hallett, Watson Freeman, and Benjamin F.
Edmands. Mr. Hallett, the leading spirit of the trio, was a
politician in whom a strong desire for popularity among
the masses, was constantly overmastered by a stronger
desire for the patronage of the Federal Government.
Accordingly, while he had made an occasional venture to
secure the former, his heartiest and most persevering
activity was expended in pursuit of the latter.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref31" n="31" rend="sc" target="note31">1</ref><note id="note31" n="31" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref31">1 At an earlier period of his life, Mr. Hallett was, for three or
four years, associated with William Lloyd Garrison in the
promulgation of the latter's anti-slavery views, and was as much
entitled to be called a Garrisonian as any other person of that
party. He assembled with them, had a conspicuous place on
their platform, made speeches for them, reported their doings
(being a stenographer), and in other ways signalized his zeal
in the cause. Viewing him in that stage of his development
by the reflected light of his after career, one must have been
tempted to exclaim, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”</note> As the
reward of his devotion, not to say servility, the
Government had beneficed him with the office of United
States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts. This
position, he seemed to imagine, gave him the right on
the present occasion to direct the conduct, not only of
other officers of the Federal Government, but also of
the officers of the Commonwealth. Mr. Freeman, the
Marshal, was a person in whom animal courage, decision,
and resoluteness of purpose, were marked
<pb id="steve128" n="128"/>
characteristics. Upon him devolved the sole
responsibility of every step taken in the executive act of
rendition. But he naturally deferred to the law officer of
the Government, and his name was used to give sanction
to the plans of the Attorney. Mr. Edmands was a
major-general, commanding the first division of the
Massachusetts Volunteer Militia. Leading the useful but
inglorious life of a druggist in State Street for the most
part of the time, he enjoyed the distinction of going into
camp once a year, and there receiving the homage of his
troops. But holiday shows of soldiery are apt to pall, and
Mr. Edmands, not improbably, was ready to make the
most of an occasion that promised him the novel
experience of being engaged in real service. Whatever his
motive, it led him into the grave indecorum of stepping
out of his subordinate position as a military officer, and
assuming the character of dictator to his civil superior.</p>
          <p>Having decided upon the course to be pursued, these
persons threw themselves upon the Mayor, for the
purpose of coercing him into the adoption of their
measures. They commenced their efforts for this end at
an early stage of the trial. They sought and obtained
personal interviews with him at the City Hall. They
addressed to him repeated letters of remonstrance and
advice. The result was, that the Mayor abandoned his
first purpose, surrendered his own judgment, and
conformed his official conduct to the programme which
they had
<pb id="steve129" n="129"/>
marked out. The correspondence which passed between
the several parties clearly developed this change, and
the influences by which it was effected.</p>
          <p>From the night of the riot until the Tuesday following,
two companies of the city soldiery had been under
arms for the preservation of the peace. On that day,
the Marshal and the Attorney addressed a formal
communication to the Mayor, declaring that force to be
insufficient for the purpose, and expressing the opinion
that the entire command of Gen. Edmands within the
city would be requisite. The Mayor's view of the case
was the reverse of this.</p>
          <p>“After a full examination of the condition of the city
this morning,” said he, in a note to Gen. Edmands, dated
May 31st, “I feel justified in saying that one military
company will be amply sufficient, from this date till
further orders , to maintain order and suppress any
riotous proceedings.”</p>
          <p>He therefore directed Gen. Edmands to discharge one
of the two companies at nine o'clock on that morning.
This order was followed by another, bearing the same
date, and directed to the same officer, in which, after
declaring that it had been made to appear to him that a
mob was threatened, the Mayor commanded Gen.
Edmands to cause an entire Brigade, together with an
additional corps of Cadets, to be paraded on the morning
of June second, for the purpose of repressing
<pb id="steve130" n="130"/>
the anticipated tumult.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref32" n="32" rend="sc" target="note32">1</ref><note id="note32" n="32" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref32">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixf">Appendix F.</ref></note> This sudden and extraordinary
change of opinion and conduct was caused by no
popular outbreak unexpectedly arising after the first order
for discharging the company had been issued. The cause
was suggested by Mayor Smith himself in his answers to
certain interrogatories subsequently made under oath.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref33" n="33" rend="sc" target="note33">2</ref><note id="note33" n="33" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref33">2 In the case of Ela <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">vs.</hi></foreign> Smith and others, growing out of the

“some two or three days before the second of June, and
expressed an opinion that the military force then on duty
was inadequate to the maintenance of the peace of the
city. I was soon convinced that more force was
necessary, and at once took measures accordingly.” In
addition to this personal interview, the Marshal and
Attorney addressed to him, under date of May 31st, a
joint communication in which the same views were urged
upon his consideration.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34">3</ref><note id="note34" n="34" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref34">3 A curious proof of the District Attorney's usurping disposition
was disclosed by the communications which were addressed to the
Mayor, by the Marshal and himself. The first was signed by the
Marshal alone, and was simply endorsed “approved” by Mr.
Hallett. The second was signed by both; but the name of the
Marshal, who was the chief and only really responsible officer,
was placed beneath that of the Attorney. See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixg">Appendix G.</ref></note> The interview and the despatch
of the letter manifestly occurred in the interval between
the issuing of the Mayor's two contradictory orders of
that day. It thus appeared that while the Mayor's own
careful observation of the condition
<pb id="steve131" n="131"/>
of the city had convinced him that but one company
of military was necessary, the representations of the
United States officers convinced him, an hour or two
after, that a whole Brigade was necessary.</p>
          <p>The ostensible object of the extraordinary interference
by the United States officers with the Mayor's functions,
was the preservation of the peace of the city. “The
Marshal does not ask any aid to execute the fugitive law
as such,” said that officer in his communication of May
30th; “nothing is required but the preservation of the
peace of the city.” “We repeat what we have before
said, that the United States officers do not desire you to
execute the process under the fugitive law of the United
States, which devolves on them alone in the discharge of
their duties; but they call upon you as the conservator of
the peace of the city;”—so wrote both the District
Attorney and the Marshal in their communication of May
31st. “They distinctly and explicitly declare that the
United States Government neither wished nor asked any
assistance from the city of Boston;”—so said the Mayor in
his sworn answers at a subsequent date.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately for this pretence, the same correspondence
showed that the design was to enlist the troops of
Massachusetts, in effect, though not in form, in the service
of the United States. In their first communication, the
two functionaries of the
<pb id="steve132" n="132"/>
Federal Government, while disclaiming any authority,
declared their belief that the expenses incurred by
mustering the large military force which they called on the
Mayor for, would be met by the President. The Mayor
hesitated; their “belief” was not a sufficient guarantee.
He addressed to them a note of inquiry touching that
point. In the interval, Mr. Hallett, still taking the lead in
another man's business, had sought and obtained from the
President full authority for incurring the proposed
expense.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35">1</ref><note id="note35" n="35" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref35">1 Throughout the whole affair, a frequent correspondence by
telegraph was kept up between the United States officers at
Boston and the President at Washington. The zeal and vigor
which the Federal Executive displayed in enforcing an odious
statute on this occasion, stands in striking contrast to his
indifference, not to say connivance, on a later occasion, at the
most high-handed violation of the Constitution and the laws. See
<ref targOrder="U" target="appendixh">Appendix H.</ref></note> In the next communication, accordingly, the
assurance of this authority, confirmed by a copy of the
President's despatch, was given to the Mayor. Then
immediately followed the order for mustering the Brigade.
It seemed clear, therefore, on the one hand, that if, In the
Mayor's judgment, there had been a real necessity for
calling out a Brigade to preserve the peace of Boston, he
would not have waited for an assurance that the expense
would be met by a foreign government; and on the other
hand, that the President would not have felt authorized to
draw money from the national treasury for the purpose of
preserving the peace of a municipal corporation.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref36" n="36" rend="sc" target="note36">1</ref><note id="note36" n="36" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref36">1 The sum of fourteen thousand dollars, or thereabouts, was paid
out of the United States treasury to Mayor Smith, for services
rendered on this occasion by the Massachusetts militia. This
money was paid by him directly to the several companies, without
passing into the city treasury or in any way coming under the
control of the city government. No record exists at the City Hall
that any such transaction ever took place. In disbursing the
money, therefore, Dr. Smith acted, not in his capacity as Mayor,
or as magistrate, but as an agent of the Federal Government. He
supported two distinct characters in the tragedy—that of a
Massachusetts magistrate in calling out the troops, and that
of a Federal disbursing agent in paying them.</note>
<pb id="steve133" n="133"/>
The tenor of his note to Mr. Hallett, singularly 
at variance with the latter's pretences,
placed the matter beyond a doubt. “Incur,” said he,
“any expense deemed necessary by the Marshal and
yourself for city military or otherwise, <hi rend="italics">to insure the
execution of the law.”</hi> Yielding to a requisition based
upon such a document, the Mayor did, in effect, constitute
the Massachusetts troops a part of the Marshal's armed
<foreign lang="lat">posse comitatus.</foreign></p>
          <p>The order for mustering the Brigade, which was signed
by the Mayor and directed to Gen. Edmands, was drawn
up by the latter officer. Distrusting his superior's
knowledge of the military statutes, and confident of his
own, he had assumed the task of preparing the formula
that was to govern his own action. A police captain,
upon entering the City Hall on the morning of June first,
met Gen. Edmands descending from the Mayor's
private room. As they entered the Police Office together,
the military chief displayed the order with the Mayor's
signature fresh upon it. “There,”
<pb id="steve134" n="134"/>
said he, “is the only order ever yet drawn up under
which the military could legally act;” and, with some
disparaging remarks on the ignorance of civilians in such
matters, he proceeded to claim it as the triumph of his
own genius. Then, as if for the purpose of justifying such
a formidable military demonstration as that which the
order contemplated, he turned and demanded of the
police captain what those men were hid away for in
Tremont Temple. “There are a thousand armed men there,”
said he. The policeman doubted the extraordinary
statement. “Yes, there are,” reiterated the general in a
heat; “a gentleman who saw them told me; d—n them,”
continued he, with a profane zeal worthy of his cause,
“<sic corr="we'll">we 'll</sic> fix 'em.” The thousand men were “men in
buckram.”</p>
          <p>Armed with the authority conveyed by this precept,
Gen. Edmands proceeded to issue his orders for
assembling the troops. At half-past eight o'clock on the
morning of June second, the whole force paraded on
Boston Common. It consisted of the First Battalion of
Light Dragoons, the Fifth Regiment of Artillery, the
Fifth Regiment of Light Infantry the Third Battalion of
Light Infantry, and the corps of Cadets. In all, there were
twenty-two companies, including two of cavalry, and not
less than a thousand soldiers. These troops were as fine
specimens of the citizen soldiery of the Union as could
anywhere be found. Often had they, on parade days,
attracted the admiration of their fellow-citizens by their
martial bearing,
<pb id="steve135" n="135"/>
the tasteful splendor of their uniforms, and the perfection
of their drill. As the product of free institutions, they were
held in just pride by the whole community, and never had
an occasion arisen to interrupt the sympathy between the
two classes. Now, for the first time, were these troops
drawn up in hostile array against the people, to assist in
executing the most odious statute that ever found a place
in the archives of a free republic. The spectacle turned the
popular complacency in their favorites into indignation
and disgust.</p>
          <p>A strong <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">esprit du corps,</hi></foreign> together with the military
maxim of unquestioning obedience, sufficed to bring out
the companies with full ranks. But they were far from
being unanimous in their approval of the object for which
they were called forth. A keen sense of the ignominy to
which they were subjected, filled the breasts of some, and
caused them to hang their heads with shame. Some were
indifferent to the moral character of the occasion, but were
anxious to signalize their soldiership. Others sympathized
with the slavehunter and rejoiced in the opportunity to
render him aid with ball and bayonet. The general habits
and conduct of these latter corresponded with their
disposition. As they stood in line on the Common, they
compromised the character of the whole corps by their
free use of intoxicating liquor and the singing of ribald
songs. At a later period in the day, a company or
detachment posted in State street, opposite the Exchange,
quite bore off the
<pb id="steve136" n="136"/>
palm of infamy by conduct of this sort. Filled with liquor,
even to intoxication, they became lost to all sense of
decorum, and, reeling upon their gunstocks, sang the
chorus, “Oh, carry me back to Old Virginny.”</p>
          <p>The character and conduct of the officers were as
diverse as those of the men. Some went to the discharge
of their duty, cursing the authorities who had imposed it
upon them. Some pressed forward with alacrity as to
congenial business. Conspicuous among the subalterns,
was the commander of the Light Dragoons. His
intemperate zeal for the maintenance of law on this
occasion, was in striking contrast with the disposition
which he manifested at a later period, when, at a convivial
entertainment of the soldiery, he bade open defiance to a
recently enacted statute that was intended to deprive
him, and such as him, of their favorite beverages. The
day did not pass without his giving in his own person a
humiliating proof of the necessity of such a law. While
endeavoring to ride down a nimble bystander whose sole
offence was the expression of an opinion, he reeled from
his saddle and fell prostrate upon the pavement.</p>
          <p>The part to be performed by the police in the act of
rendition, as well as that of the military, was prescribed
by the United States officers. On the morning of Friday,
June second, the Chief of the Police summoned his
deputy and the captains of the several stations into his
office, and locked the door. He then produced a diagram
of Court
<pb id="steve137" n="137"/>
Square, Court and State streets, and of the streets and
avenues leading into them, together with certain written
instructions, all of which he had received from the
Mayor.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref37" n="37" rend="sc" target="note37">1</ref><note id="note37" n="37" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref37">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixi">Appendix I.</ref></note> The diagram, he informed his subordinates,
represented the section of the city which was to be
entirely cleared of the people and to be taken possession
of by the military and police. He then proceeded to impart
to the assembled captains their instructions. Among the
number was Joseph K. Hayes, captain of the South
Station. This officer had already acted a significant part in
the business. On the morning after the attack on the
Court House, he had called at the Chief's office for
orders; he was directed to bring up fifteen of his men and
station them in the office of the Water Registrar, opening
upon the Square. Having obeyed the order, he forthwith
sought the Mayor, and inquired what his men were to do.</p>
          <p>“Are we to help the slave-catchers?” said he.</p>
          <p>“No”, replied the Mayor, “protect the property and
lives of the citizens—nothing more.”</p>
          <p>Captain Hayes returned to his men and informed them
of his interview with the Mayor, and of the instructions
which he had received.</p>
          <p>“Now,” continued he, “I wish you distinctly to
understand how much I shall help the United States in
this business. If there is an attempt at a rescue, and it is
likely to fail, I shall help the rescuers.” In accordance
with his expectation and
<pb id="steve138" n="138"/>
wish, this speech was immediately reported to the Chief
by some of the men under his command.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hayes was the first to receive his instructions. He
was directed to take his men, pass down State street, and
notify each occupant of the buildings on the right, that
by the Mayor's command they were to close their places
of business. Having reached Commercial street, he was
to draw up his men in a line across that street, cause
them to join hands, and in that manner force back the
crowd to Milk street, where he was to hold them at all
hazards. Immediately after, a detachment of military was
to be posted across Commercial, at its junction with State
street. The whole space in Commercial street, between
Milk and State streets, would thus be kept vacant. He
was further instructed that, if his police force should be
unable to maintain their stand against the pressure of the
crowd, they were to swing back right and left; <hi rend="italics">this was to
be a signal to the military at the other end, who had
instructions instantly, without giving warning, to fire
upon the crowd.</hi></p>
          <p>The same instructions were repeated to the rest of the
captains. Each was charged with the duty of clearing a
particular street, each was to be followed by a military
detachment, having orders to fire without warning.</p>
          <p>Mr. Hayes listened attentively to this programme.
“Mr. Chief,” said he, “does not this look like helping to
carry off Burns?” The Chief, with some embarrassment,
made an indistinct reply. Just
<pb id="steve139" n="139"/>
then a tap was made on the door. Upon its being
opened, the Mayor entered, and bowing to those
present said:</p>
          <p>“The Commissioner has just entered the courtroom to
give his decision, and has required me to see that the
Square and the various avenues are cleared.” Then,
instructing the Chief forthwith to attend to that duty, he
withdrew. Mr. Hayes again spoke:</p>
          <p>“The Commissioner gives directions to the
Mayor, the Mayor to the Chief of Police, the Chief
to his captains, they to their men; this is a pretty
strong chain binding us to the act of rendition.”</p>
          <p>Without further words, he retired to another room,
wrote a resignation of his office, and then, entering the
Mayor's private apartment, placed it in his hands. Greatly
agitated, the Mayor entreated him to revoke it, but Mr.
Hayes had not acted hastily, and remained immovable.
Taking a copy of his resignation, he carried it to the
office of one of the newspaper presses, which, during
this memorable occasion, were throwing off editions at all
hours of the day, and within an hour's time it was
scattered over the whole city.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref38" n="38" rend="sc" target="note38">1</ref><note id="note38" n="38" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref38">1 This act, so rare in the history of official life, involved the
sacrifice, not only of assured position, but also of the most
flattering prospects. But it had its reward. See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixj">Appendix J.</ref></note></p>
          <p>The resignation of Mr. Hayes seriously deranged the
plans of the Mayor and his advisers. They had intended
to disguise the employment of the military by pushing
the police prominently forward.</p>
          <pb id="steve140" n="140"/>
          <p>The police were to clear the streets, they only were to
come in contact with the people and force them back
beyond the outer barrier of the reserved section. When
this was complete and the space clear, the military were
to march in and take up the several positions assigned
them. The failure of the police to accomplish their part of
the task made it necessary to call in the aid of the
military. The selection of the officer to whom the
business was entrusted, was significant of the
influences that controlled the proceedings. This was
Isaac H. Wright. He was one of the very few men of
Massachusetts who had set at naught the principles of
their fathers by volunteering in the war with Mexico. The
fellow-officer of Gen. Pierce in that wicked raid, his equal
in military skill, not less his equal in moral character,
scarcely his inferior as a claimant upon his party for
promotion, of congenial habits, and like him often
hazarding all upon a powerful flow of spirits, he was yet,
unlike him, made to feel full sorely the caprice of
Democracy in the distribution of political favors. For
while Gen. Pierce, returning from the plains of Mexico,
had been wafted into the Presidential Chair by
prosperous winds blowing from all quarters, Col. Wright
was left to exchange the sword for the hammer and to
settle down into the humdrum life of an auctioneer. He
was now, however, the captain of the Light Dragoons,
and no officer in all the Massachusetts troops was more
ready to assist in the execution of the fugitive slave act
than himself. In committing
<pb id="steve141" n="141"/>
to him and his mounted Dragoons the duty of
driving the citizens from their thoroughfares and places
of business, the authorities could not expect that any
tenderness would temper their zeal. </p>
          <p>In the midst of these preparations, the city was
electrified by the following proclamation which was
posted at the comers of the streets:</p>
          <q type="proclamation" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>

decision had been pronounced.</note></head>
                  <p>To secure order throughout the city this day,
Major-General Edmands and the Chief of Police
will make such disposition of the respective forces
under their commands as will best promote that
important object; and they are clothed with full
discretionary power to sustain the laws of the land.
All well-disposed citizens and other persons are
urgently requested to leave those streets which it
may be found necessary to clear temporarily, and
under no circumstances to obstruct or molest any
officer, civil or military, in the lawful discharge of
his duty.</p>

          </q>
          <p>By this proclamation the whole city was in effect
placed under martial law. It notified the citizens that the
Mayor had, for the time, delegated his power to a
military officer and abdicated his office. The legality of
this step was afterward seriously called in question.
Among others who took this
<pb id="steve142" n="142"/>
ground, was Peleg W. Chandler, then a member of the
Executive Council of the Commonwealth, and previously,
Solicitor for the city of Boston. In an argument that
never was refuted, he examined the Mayor's whole
course in relation to the military, and maintained that in
several particulars he had acted without warrant of law.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40">1</ref><note id="note40" n="40" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref40">1 See Boston Atlas of June 12th and 16th, 1854. I much regret
that the length of this able argument precludes its insertion in
this volume.</note></p>
          <p>About eleven o'clock, the troops on the Common
received orders to move down into Court and State
streets. Each man had been supplied with eleven
rounds of powder and ball, and, before moving, they
proceeded to load in the presence of the assembled
spectators. Then, without music, they marched down
through the above-named streets, dropping off
detachments at the several side streets, until the whole
were posted.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the Marshal had been making his own
preparations. One hundred and twenty-five men were
sworn in as specials. Some of these were tide-waiters,
truckmen, and other dependents upon the Custom
House; all were taken from the least reputable portion of
the citizens of Boston. No better could be obtained. So
great had been the change in public opinion since the
extradition of Sims, when merchants, bankers, ship-
owners, and others of repute had pressed forward with
offers of personal service in forcing back that hapless
negro into slavery and death. These specials
<pb id="steve143" n="143"/>
were assembled in the Court House, and armed with
cutlasses, pistols, and billies. They were then placed
under the command of one Peter T. Dunbar, a Custom
House truckman, who led them into an upper hall of the
building, and there drilled them in marching and other
exercises before the door of Burns's cell. Besides these,
the Marshal had assembled five companies of United
States troops, numbering one hundred and forty men;
and, to complete his array, a brass cannon had been
transported from the Navy Yard in Charlestown, at early
dawn, and planted in the Square.</p>
          <p>At eleven o'clock, Court Square presented a
spectacle that became indelibly engraved upon the
memories of men. The people had been swept out of the
Square, and stood crowded together in Court street,
presenting to the eye a solid rampart of living beings.
At the eastern door of the Court House, stood the
cannon, loaded, and with its mouth pointed full upon the
compact mass. By its side stood the officer commanding
the detachment of United States troops, gazing with
steady composure in the same direction. It was the first
time that the armed power of the United States had ever
been arrayed against the people of Massachusetts.
Men who witnessed the sight, and reflected upon its
cause, were made painfully to recognize the fact, before
unfelt, that they were the subjects of two governments.</p>
          <p>After the decision, Burns remained in the courtroom
awaiting the hour of his departure. The
<pb id="steve144" n="144"/>
retainers of the Marshal crowded around him with
attempts at consolation. His guards especially
endeavored to cheer his spirits. They gave him four
dollars; they assured him that it was their intention to
purchase his freedom; they had made arrangements with
his owner, they said, and had already obtained four
hundred dollars toward the object. To all these
professions and promises Burns paid little heed; they
came from the same men who had captured him. At
length, Deputy Marshal Riley entered the room and
ordered him to be handcuffed. Burns earnestly
remonstrated against the indignity; he gave assurances
that he would pass through the streets quietly, if allowed
to go unshackled, otherwise, he threatened to make every
demonstration of violence in his power. Butman
thereupon left the room, and sought the Marshal's
permission to dispense with the instruments of disgrace;
and, in spite of counsel to the contrary from some
cowardly adviser who stood by, the request was granted.
The slavery into which Burns was returning was an evil
which he had borne from the cradle, but the iron fetters
were symbols of disgrace which his unbroken spirit was
not prepared to endure.</p>
          <p>One o'clock had arrived, and yet the movement of the
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">cortege</hi></foreign> was delayed. Meanwhile, Gen. Edmands had
from time to time dashed into the Square, and,
dismounting, held hurried conferences with the Marshal
in the building. A bystander who heard their
conversation, learned that the
<pb id="steve145" n="145"/>
delay was caused by the General's inability to clear the
streets, and his fear of being unable to accomplish the
task he had undertaken.</p>
          <p>At length, about two o'clock, the column was formed in
the Square. First came a detachment of United States
Artillery, followed by a platoon of United States Marines.
After these followed the armed civil posse of the Marshal,
to which succeeded two platoons of Marines. The
cannon, guarded by another platoon of Marines, brought
up the rear. When this arrangement was completed,
Burns, accompanied by a officer on each side with arms
interlocked, was conducted from his prison through a
passage lined with soldiers, and placed in the centre of
the armed posse. Immediately after the decision, Mr. Dana
and Mr. Grimes had asked permission to walk with
Burn's arm in arm, from the Court House to the vessel
at the wharf; and the Marshal had given them his consent.
At the last moment, he sought them out and requested
that they would not insist upon the performance of his
promise, because, in the opinion of some of the military
officers, such a spectacle would add to the excitement.
Mr. Dana declined to release the Marshal from his
promise. The latter persisted in urging the abandonment
of the purpose.</p>
          <p>“Do I understand you,” asked Mr. Dana, “to say
distinctly that we <hi rend="italics">shall not</hi> accompany Burns, after
having given your promise that we might?”</p>
          <p>The Marshal winced under the pressure of this
<pb id="steve146" n="146"/>
pointed question, but after a momentary reluctance
answered firmly, “Yes.” Accordingly, without a single
friend at his side, and hemmed in by a thickset hedge of
gleaming blades, Burns took his departure.</p>
          <p>The route from the Court House to the wharf had by
this time become thronged with a countless multitude. It
seemed as if the whole population of the city had been
concentrated upon this narrow space. In vain the military
and police had attempted to clear the streets; the
carriage-way alone was kept vacant. On the sidewalks in
Court and State streets, every available spot was occupied;
all the passages, windows, and balconies, from basement
to attic, overflowed with gazers, while the roofs of the
buildings were black with human beings. It was
computed that not less than fifty thousand people had
gathered to witness the spectacle.</p>
          <p>At different points along the route, were displayed
symbols significant of the prevailing sentiment.
A distinguished member of the Suffolk Bar, whose
office was directly opposite the courtroom, and who was,
at the time, commander of the Ancient and Honorable
Artillery, draped his windows in mourning. The example
was quickly followed by others. From a window opposite
the Old State House, was suspended a black coffin, upon
which was the legend, <hi rend="italics">The Funeral of Liberty.</hi> At a point
farther on toward the wharf,
<pb id="steve147" n="147"/>
a venerable merchant had caused a rope to be stretched
from his own warehouse across State street to an
opposite point, and the American flag, draped in
mourning, to be suspended therefrom with the union
down. On looking forth from his window some time after,
he saw a man intent on casting a cord over the rope, for
the purpose of tearing down the flag.</p>
          <p>“Rascal!” shouted the old man, as he sallied forth
with his long white hair streaming behind, “desist, or I'll
prosecute you.”</p>
          <p>“I am an American,” answered the other, “and am
not going to see the flag of. my country disgraced.”</p>
          <p>“I too am an American, and a native of this city,”
retorted the State street merchant, “and I declare that my
country is eternally disgraced by this day's proceedings.
That flag hangs there by my orders: touch it at your
peril.” The flag remained, until the transaction of which,
in its dishonor, it was a fit emblem, was fully ended.</p>
          <p>Along this Via Dolorosa, with its cloud of witnesses,
the column now began to move. No music enlivened its
march; the dull tramp of the soldiers on the rocky
pavements, and the groans and hisses of the bystanders,
were the only sounds. As it proceeded, its numbers were
swelled by unexpected additions. Unauthorized, the
zealous commander of the mounted Dragoons joined it
with his corps. The Lancers, jealous of their
<pb id="steve148" n="148"/>
rivals, hastened to follow the example: thus vanguard
and rear-guard consisted of Massachusetts troops. In its
progress, it went past the Old State House, where, in
1646, the founders of the Commonwealth enacted that
solemn condemnation of human slavery, which stands at
the beginning of this volume.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41">1</ref><note id="note41" n="41" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref41">1 This remark applies not to the building, but to the spot on
which it stands. The present structure was erected in 1748.</note>
 Just below, it passed over
the ground where, in the Massacre of 1770, fell Attucks,
the first negro martyr in the cause of American liberty.</p>
          <p>Opposite the Custom House, the column turned at a
right angle into another street. This cross movement
suddenly checked the long line of spectators which had
been pressing down, State street, parallel with the other
body; but the rear portion, not understanding the nature
of the obstruction, continued to press forward, and
forced the front from the sidewalk into the middle of the
Street. To the chafed and watchful military, this
movement wore the aspect of an assault on the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">cortege;</hi></foreign>
instantly some Lancers, stationed near, rode their horses
furiously at the surging crowd, and hacked with their
sabres upon the defenceless heads within their reach.
Immediately after, a detachment of infantry charged upon
the dense mass, at a run, with fixed bayonets. Some were
pitched headlong down the cellar-ways, some were forced
into the passages, and up flights of stairs, and
<pb id="steve149" n="149"/>
others were overthrown upon the pavement, bruised
and wounded.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref42" n="42" rend="sc" target="note42">1</ref><note id="note42" n="42" rend="sc" anchored="yes" target="ref42">1 The assaults of the soldiers on the bystanders resulted in
serious injury to several persons. One, A. L. Haskell, was attacked
by Capt. Evans with a drawn sword, and cut on the back of the
hand, for hissing and crying “shame.” Holding up to view his
bleeding hand, Mr. Haskell asked the officer his name and
business. Capt. Evans gave his name, and to the inquiry touching
his business, replied, “to kill just such d—d rascals as you are.” A
man named John Milton had his head laid open by a sabre cut, and
was borne off to the hospital, where he lay for several weeks. But
the most aggravated case was that of William H. Ela. While
attempting to proceed quietly about his own business, he was
assaulted by soldiers; beaten on the head with muskets; cut and
bruised in the face; knocked down upon the pavement; and finally
carried off and placed in confinement. These injuries impaired his
mind to such an extent, that he was unable to go on with the
business in which he was previously engaged, and which was his
chief dependence for a livelihood. He afterward brought an action
against Mayor Smith and others, for the assault, which became
important as testing a question of law, and also as bringing to light
material facts relating to the extradition of Burns.</note></p>
          <p>While this was passing, the procession moved on and
reached the wharf. A breach of trust had secured to the
Federal authorities the use of this wharf for their present
purpose. It was the property of a company, by whom it
had been committed in charge to an agent. Without their
knowledge and against their wishes, he had granted to
the Marshal its use on this occasion. When arraigned
afterward by his employers for such betrayal of trust, he
replied that he had since been rewarded by an
appointment to a place in the Custom House.</p>
          <p>At the end of the wharf lay a small steamer
<pb id="steve150" n="150"/>
which had been chartered by the United States
Government. On board this vessel Burns was conducted
by the Marshal, and immediately withdrawn from the
sight of the gazing thousands into the cabin below. The
United States troops followed and, after an hour's delay,
the cannon was also shipped. At twenty minutes past
three, o'clock, the steamer left the wharf, and went down
the harbor.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
          <head>THE EARLY LIFE OF BURNS.</head>
          <p>ANTHONY BURNS was born in Stafford county, Virginia.
This county lies on the Potomac river, midway between
the birth-place and the burial-place of Washington.
Washed by one of the noblest rivers in the Union, for
commercial purposes, and with an excellent soil and
climate, it has not only failed to keep pace with the
general prosperity of the country, but has even gone
backward. In 1850, its population was nearly half a
thousand less than at the close of the preceding decade;
the whole number of persons, bond and free, then
scattered over its surface of three hundred and
 thirty-five square miles, was only 8044. It has shared, perhaps,
only proportionably in the decay which slavery has
wrought in the whole eastern section of the Old
Dominion.</p>
          <p>The seat of justice in this little county is a village of
eighty or ninety houses clustered around the Court
House. At this place, twenty-three years ago, resided a
slaveholder named John Suttle. He was the owner of
twelve or fifteen slaves, the male portion of whom he
employed in quarrying stone for the city of
Washington. Among the number was
<pb id="steve152" n="152"/>
the mother of Anthony, who was employed in the family
as a cook. She had been married to three husbands, by
whom she had borne thirteen children, thus proving
herself to be a valuable piece of property for her owner.
Her last husband was a man of more than ordinary
intelligence, and had been entrusted by his owner with a
sort of supervision over other laborers in the quarry. It
was whispered about among his fellow-bondmen that he
had once been a freeman and had come from the North,
but nothing was known with certainty on this point.</p>
          <p>Anthony was this man's son and the youngest of his
mother's children. Before he could remember, the death of
his father, caused by inhaling the stone dust of the
quarry, had occurred, and he remained as his mother's
consolation. While he was yet a little child lying about
the kitchen hearth, Mr. Suttle died, and his widow
became the head of the family. Under her management,
the estate did not prosper, and, to relieve herself from
embarrassment, she sold a portion of the slaves, five of
whom were the children of Burns's mother. Not long after,
the family removed to Acquia, a small hamlet lying five or
six miles north of Stafford Court House. This change of
place did not brighten their prospects. The temper of the
dame did not improve under continued adverse fortune,
and in her fits of ill humor she was wont to vent her
spleen upon Anthony's mother. Frequently she would
threaten to sell the woman by the sale of whose children
she had already been kept from
<pb id="steve153" n="153"/>
bankruptcy; and at length so far carried her threat into
execution as to hire her out to labor in a distant city. The
mother pleaded hard for leave to take her little boy
Anthony with her, but this boon was denied; the
youngster might be made a source of profit at home. For
two years they were not permitted to see each other. At
the end of that period, Mrs. Suttle made a journey to the
city to receive the wages of her slave, and on this
occasion was gracious enough to take Anthony with
her.</p>
          <p>When he was about six years old, Mrs. Suttle
suddenly died. The settlement of her affairs fell into the
hands of her eldest son, Charles F. Suttle, who found it
necessary, in order to save them from utter ruin, to
mortgage the slaves and raise money for the payment of
the debts. Mr. Suttle and his family held a respectable
position in society, but a strict classification would not
have assigned them a place among the First Families of
Virginia. His business was that of a shopkeeper, to which
he united that of a deputy sheriff; ultimately, he attained
to the dignity of high sheriff for his county. At one time
he was fortunate enough to be chosen as the
representative of his district in the Virginia Assembly. To
these civic distinctions were added military honors; he
rose through lower grades to the post of colonel in the
Virginia militia, under which designation he first became
known to the great world. Of a powerful frame, well filled
out, of commanding stature, and a heavy, Cass-like
countenance, he was well fitted for situations
<pb id="steve154" n="154"/>
which did not require intellectual so much as physical
superiority.</p>
          <p>Such was the man who now became the proprietor and
master of Anthony. The boy was inured <sic>betimes</sic> to labor,
but his earliest tasks were light. A wise slaveholder
would as soon think of putting a six month's colt upon
the race-course, as of overtaxing the tender and growing
muscles of his young slaves. Anthony's juvenile
contribution to his owner's annual income consisted in
“nursing” his sister's baby, she being thereby left free to
pursue her toil without interruption.  In this capacity he
accompanied her to the house of one Horton, to whom
she had been hired. It was while there that he acquired
the first rudiments of learning. A sister of Horton kept a
school in her house hard by, and with the children
attending it Anthony was frequently brought in contact.
He rendered them little personal services, and in true
juvenile sodality and in defiance of Virginia law, they, at
his request, taught him the alphabet from a primer which
one had given him.</p>
          <p>At the age of seven, he was set to work directly to
earn money for his owner, being then hired out to three
maiden ladies for fifteen dollars a year. His principal
duties in this new situation were to wait in the house, to
run of errands, and to ride to the distant mill for a weekly
supply of the indispensable corn meal. His mistresses
were not unkind, and being religiously disposed, they
even attempted once or twice to impart to him some
<pb id="steve155" n="155"/>
knowledge of the Bible; but their efforts were too, slight to
produce any impression. When the year of his
engagement had elapsed, he was hired to another person,
living some miles distant, for twenty-five dollars a year.
Another opportunity for picking up some scraps of
learning was here afforded, which Anthony did not fail to
improve. The wife of his new master kept a school in her
house, bringing spelling-books and other educational
apparatus directly before the eyes of the young slave.
His thirst for knowledge was thus whetted, and by
performing antics and drolleries for the amusement of the
children, he induced them to teach him how to spell.
What to them was an irksome task, was to him a chosen
reward. In this situation he remained two years, and so
well satisfied was his master with his good conduct that
he made arrangements to hire him for a third year.
Anthony, however, was of a different mind; he had been
in some respects shabbily treated, and consequently
refused to remain. In this conclusion his owner, after
bearing his story, acquiesced.</p>
          <p>He now went to live with William Brent, at Falmouth
on the Rappahannock river. This man, who afterward
rescued his name from obscurity by becoming a swift
witness against Burns, was not at that time a person of
much renown in his native region. The husband of a
young lady of some fortune, he lived in her mansion, was
served by her slaves, and made himself merry with eating
and drinking at her expense. The chase and other
<pb id="steve156" n="156"/>
social and spendthrift pastimes constituted at that time
the business of his life. His wife was a woman of superior
endowments, and, what was more to her credit, she
treated her slaves with great kindness. To Anthony she
was especially indulgent, and he always spoke of her
afterward in terms of affection and respect. With these
people he remained two years, earning for his owner fifty
dollars each year; and so well pleased was Brent with the
bright, active young slave, that he proceeded to make a
verbal agreement to hire him for a third year. To this
arrangement, however, Anthony refused his assent,
agreeable as the prospect was when measured by a
slave's standard. A more powerful motive than love of
personal ease had already begun to operate in his bosom.
While a very young boy, he had overheard the “elders”
of his people discoursing among themselves about the
good land far away to the north where no slaves were,
and where all of the negro race were as free as their white
brethren. Such conversations had kindled a fire in his
young breast that never went out. He longed for the
freedom of that faraway land, which his untutored
imagination invested with exaggerated glories. As he
grew in years, his passion for freedom also grew, and
gradually, it took on the form of a definite purpose. Then
he began to cast about for the method of its
accomplishment, and his natural love of learning received
an additional stimulus from the reflection that the more he
knew of letters the better fitted
<pb id="steve157" n="157"/>
he would be to execute his cherished design. With
the same end in view, he formed the resolution
never to abide long with the same master, so that
when he should at length flee from bondage, there
might be less chance of identifying him. It was
this that now led him to refuse any longer to
remain with the easy and indulgent Brents.</p>
          <p>On meeting his owner, Suttle, near the close of the
year, the latter greeted him with compliments.</p>
          <p>“Well, ‘Tony, Mr. Brent speaks very well of you. He
likes you so well that he has hired you for another year.”</p>
          <p>“But, Mas'r Charles, I <sic corr="haven't">have n't</sic> hired <hi rend="italics">him,</hi>” said
Anthony, with the confident tone of a slave conscious of
standing well with his master.</p>
          <p>“What's the matter?<sic corr="Hasn't"> Has n't</sic> he treated you well?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, mas'r, but—” Some reason, though of course
not the real one, was assigned.</p>
          <p>“Well, it can't be helped now, for I've agreed to let 
you stop with Mr. Brent; and besides, he pays more for
you than he did last year.”</p>
          <p>“Jes' you say, mas'r. The <hi rend="italics">woods</hi> is big enough to
hold me.”</p>
          <p>The<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics"> argumentum a sylva</hi></foreign> is a prevailing one with the
slaveholder. Col. Suttle yielded, and the bargain was
broken up. He knew that it was better for his own interest
to humor his slave in the choice of his field of labor, than
to run the risk of trouble and loss by thwarting his
inclinations. Long and sore experience has taught the
enlightened slaveholders
<pb id="steve158" n="158"/>
of the south, that one willing slave is worth half-a-dozen 
refractory ones. Having defeated his owner's
arrangement, Anthony was now ordered to present
himself on the “hiring-ground” and find a new master.</p>
          <p>The impoverished condition of Virginia has
engendered a peculiar custom, not found,—certainly not
to the same extent,—in the less exhausted states of the
south. Many slaveholders, having upon their hands
more slaves than employment for them, make a practice
of hiring them out to other persons needing their
services. For this purpose, they are often sent long
distances from their owner's estate, and members of the
same family are scattered wide asunder. The contracts
are made for only a single year. The time for hiring is
during the Christmas holidays. Some convenient point is
selected—at the Court House or some large village—
where the owners and their slaves assemble to arrange
the matter. This is called the hiring-ground, and, as it
remains the same from year to year, it becomes familiarly
known to the slaves in the region round about. An owner
living ten, twenty, or even thirty miles distant, has, it may
be, come to the conclusion to hire out a number of his
slaves. He summons the whole body before him,
designates several by name, and orders them to meet him
on the hiring-ground, at a specified hour of perhaps the
next day. He then directs them to procure passes at the
office and dismisses them. They are now left to find their
<pb id="steve159" n="159"/>
way to the hiring-ground on foot, whatever the distance;
and it is at their peril if they fail to appear at the
appointed time. While there—sometimes for several
days,—they are left to shift for themselves. The owner
provides them with neither food nor shelter at night;
a small piece of silver, bestowed upon each, is the extent
of the means which he places at their disposal. If they are
not fortunate enough to find shelter in the cabin of some
friendly slave in the neighborhood, they build a fire in
the street or in the field, and, gathering around, pass the
night in the open air.</p>
          <p>During the season of negotiation, the hiring-ground
exhibits a busy spectacle. Hundreds are present, all intent
upon one common business. The slave plays an
important part in the transaction. He must be as active as
his owner in finding some one to hire him. He is expected
to praise himself without stint, and to give assurance to
all inquirers that he is able to perform any sort of labor.
Often it happens that a person comes in search of a slave
qualified for some particular service, perchance that of
coachman. His eye lights upon one looking more than
usually trim, and he accosts him:</p>
          <p>“Whose boy are you?”</p>
          <p>The slave informs him.</p>
          <p>“What can you do?”</p>
          <p>The slave enumerates several kinds of employment
with which he may have been familiar.</p>
          <pb id="steve160" n="160"/>
          <p>“Can you drive a coach and take the management
and care of horses?”</p>
          <p>The slave is, it may be, totally ignorant of such
business; but, if he fears his owner's displeasure, he will
promptly answer that, he can. If he fears God (as some
do) and speaks the truth, he knows well that stripes are
likely to be his reward. Sometimes the owner stands by
and answers for him,—falsely, it may be. When a bargain is
made, the parties retire to execute it in writing. Besides
the sum of money agreed upon, the contract usually
stipulates that the person hiring shall provide the slave
with a hat or cap, a pair of shoes, and two suits of
clothes during the year. Of all these stipulations the
slave is always well informed. When the transaction is
completed, he is turned over to his new master, who
orders him to appear at his house on a specified day. He
may be indulged with a day or two more on the hiring-
ground, but from thence, without returning home, he
goes directly to his new field of service.</p>
          <p>Most of the slaves belonging to Col. Suttle were
subjected to this system of hiring, and thus it happened
that Anthony, from his earliest years, was never much
under his owner's eye. After the conversation relating to
service with Brent, he repaired to the hiring-ground and
soon fell in with a person named Foote, who was
attracted by his appearance. The attraction was not
mutual, and Anthony did not manifest much alacrity in
satisfying Foote's inquiries. Col. Suttle stood by; and
when
<pb id="steve161" n="161"/>
Foote asked Anthony what he could do, replied for him
with some sternness:</p>
          <p>“He can do <hi rend="italics">anything.”</hi></p>
          <p>It happened that Foote was in search of a boy to tend
a steam engine in his saw-mill, and to this new and
strange business the young and inexperienced slave felt
a natural aversion. But his owner was not disposed to
humor him a second time, and a bargain was concluded
by which seventy-five dollars were to be paid for his
services. Foote dwelt in the edge of Culpepper, bordering
on Stafford county, and thither Anthony now went. He
was at this time twelve or thirteen years of age.</p>
          <p>The new home did not prove to be very agreeable.
Foote and his wife were Yankees, and they presented no
exception to the classification which assigns to apostates
from northern principles of freedom a place among the
severest taskmasters of the south. Young slaves scarcely
three feet high were beaten by the mistress without
mercy. Strapped upon a plank with their faces downward,
they were belabored with an instrument of torture
peculiar to slave-land, consisting of a strip of board
perforated with holes and roughened with tar and sand.
The air, drawn through the holes as the board smote
upon the skin, would raise blisters, while the sand
increased the smart without deeply cutting up the flesh
and thereby diminishing the market value of the slave.
Besides cruelties of this sort, the most niggardly fare was
doled out, and occasionally, in a fit of gloomy merriment,
<pb id="steve162" n="162"/>
Anthony would hold up to the sun his thin shaving of
meat to show what a transparent humbug it was. His lot,
however, was not one of unmixed evil, for, through the
friendly teaching of a young daughter of his employer, he
was enabled to make some further progress in his
cherished pursuit of knowledge.</p>
          <p>When he had been two or three months in the service
of Foote, an accident of a serious nature befell him. He
was busy about the discharge of his duties in the mill,
when Foote, without giving him warning, set the
machinery in motion, and Anthony's hand was caught by
a wheel and shockingly mangled.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43">1</ref><note id="note43" n="43" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref43">1 The scar, or rather protruding broken bone, which disfigured
his hand after the wound had healed, was commonly, but of
course erroneously supposed, during his examination, to have
resulted from abusive treatment by his master.</note> This accident laid him
aside from work for two months. He returned to Falmouth,
where Col. Suttle then had a sheriff's office, and in this
was provided with a lodging until he was able to resume
his toil. On meeting his owner, he pointed to his broken
hand, and significantly remarked, “That's <hi rend="italics">‘anything.’</hi> ”
Col. Suttle did not relish this taunting allusion to his
former recommendation of Burns on the hiring-ground.</p>
          <p>During this period of suffering and exemption from
labor, occurred the crisis in Anthony's religious history.
He had been the subject of strong religious impressions
from early childhood. His mother, who was a devout
woman, had tried to
<pb id="steve163" n="163"/>
tell him something about God. He had been excited by the
fervors of the camp-meeting. About the same time, the
doctrines of Millerism had penetrated the little obscure
Virginia county, and filled all hearts with alarm. It became
the universal topic; white and black shared alike in the
excitement. The barriers of class and caste were, for the
time, thrown down, and never before had there been such
unreserved communication between master and slave. To
this was added a real cause of alarm; the scarlet fever
swept over the district, leaving fearful ravages in its path.
The young mind of Anthony shared in the general
excitement produced by these unwonted causes, and he
earnestly set about a preparation for the future life. He
would retire into the recesses of the forest to pray, but
there no light shone in upon him. Extravagant hopes and
terrors alternately possessed him. At one time he looked
momently to see Jesus appear in bodily shape before
him; at another, believing that he actually saw the Fiend
in the form of a serpent, he would spring from the
ground, and with frantic outcries rush from the forest.
Gradually, his extreme religious excitement subsided, but
he never lost the sense of spiritual need. In this condition
he remained until the accident occurred which has been
already recorded.</p>
          <p>Impelled by bodily anguish, and fearing that his injury
might terminate fatally, he applied himself with renewed
earnestness to the Friend of the afflicted. All at once a
thought flashed through his
<pb id="steve164" n="164"/>
mind:—“Here have I been praying to Jesus, whom I
have never served, and have never thought of praying to
the Devil, whom I have always served.” This was a new
revelation. He saw it was unreasonable to expect help
from a Being whose service he had not entered. He saw
that repentance and reformation of life were the first steps
for him to take. Thus put upon the right path by the
Infinite Spirit working with his spirit, he soon found the
help and peace that he sought.</p>
          <p>After a suitable lapse of time, he applied to Col. Suttle,
according to custom, for leave to be baptized; no slave
being suffered to comply with that command of the
Saviour or admitted to the church without a written
permission from his owner. To Anthony's request, Col.
Suttle, irritated by the prospect of loss from the maimed
hand, returned a rough refusal, and even added words to
wound the spirit of the young convert. If he joined the
church, Suttle said, he would soon be drinking or
following the women, like others. Anthony turned away
with a heavy heart, but still with a silent resolve to pray
that God would yet incline his owner to grant his request.
The prayer was answered. Returning some time after from
Foote's, where he had again resumed his labor in the mill,
he unexpectedly met his owner in a carriage, on his way
to the Springs. The latter kindly saluted him, and now of
his own accord gave the requisite permission for baptism.
Emboldened by such rare favor, Anthony petitioned for
money to buy clothes in
<pb id="steve165" n="165"/>
which to appear with decency on the occasion of taking
his baptismal vows, and received two dollars,—sixteen-
fold more than Col. Suttle ever gave him at any one time,
before or after.</p>
          <p>At the proper time he was baptized and received
into the Baptist church at Falmouth. The church
consisted of white freemen and black slaves. All
assembled within the same walls for worship on
the Sabbath, but a partition of boards separated the
bond from the free. When the Holy Supper was
administered, the cup was first carefully served to all
of the privileged class, and afterward to their sable
brethren. Those distinctions were not maintained in
anticipation of heaven, but in deference to the prejudices
of Virginia society. In the social religious meetings there
was a somewhat nearer approach to the New Testament
model, and the prayers and exhortations of the slaves
were graciously suffered to intermingle with those
proceeding from the master's lips.</p>
          <p>Among the Christian slaves at the south there is a
class of persons that bear the character of quasi-pastors
or preachers. Without being formally set apart to the
sacred office by any rite of ordination, they yet receive a
sort of recognition from the church with which they may
happen to be connected. Piety, a gift at exhortation, and
a desire for the work of a preacher, are the requisite
qualifications. All these were found in Anthony when, at
the end of two years from the period of his baptism, he
applied to his brethren for their recognition
<pb id="steve166" n="166"/>
of him as a preacher. A day was appointed when he
should exhibit his gifts to the assembled members of the
church. Sitting around with ears more than usually
critical, yet not without sympathy, they listened while
Anthony addressed to them an exhortation from the desk.
His effort proved satisfactory, and, at the close, pastor
and brethren, taking him by the hand, bade him God
speed. Thenceforth he exercised his now office as he had
opportunity. Gathering a little congregation of slaves,
sometimes in the kitchen of a friendly white person,
sometimes in the rude cabin of a slave, he would lead
them in their devotions and speak to them of the Gospel.
These meetings, however, as well as all other assemblies
consisting exclusively of slaves, were violations of
Virginia law. Every such assembly, unless sanctioned by
the presence of a white, was exposed to rude interruption,
and the slaves that might be caught, to severe
punishment. The patrols and guards that nightly walked
their rounds were constantly on the watch to detect these
secret meetings, and, in spite of all caution, they would
occasionally succeed. Perhaps while the assembly were
in the act of prayer, the door would be suddenly burst
open by a throng of profane officials, each with cord in
hand, bent on securing as many victims as possible.
When such <sic>surprisals</sic> occurred, the first movement
would be to extinguish the lights; then, through door,
window, and even chimney, the affrighted worshippers
hurried their escape. Those who were
<pb id="steve167" n="167"/>
unlucky enough to be caught, were taken to the cage,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref44" n="44" rend="sc" target="note44">1</ref><note id="note44" n="44" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref44">1 A place provided everywhere in towns at the South, for the
temporary confinement of delinquent slaves.</note>
and the next day rewarded with nine-and-thirty lashes at
the whipping post for having peacefully, but unlawfully,
assembled to worship God. Anthony was not without
experience of this sort, though he was always so
fortunate as to escape from the clutches of the officers.</p>
          <p>In his new capacity, it sometimes fell to his lot to
perform the marriage rite for slaves, or what among them
was called such; and sometimes to conduct the burial
service for the dead. If a slave died during the week, no
funeral was allowed to interrupt the daily toil of the
plantation. The body, encased perchance in an orange-box,
was deposited in the ground without ceremony or
delay, and a few shovelfulls of earth were thrown in,
while the bereaved kindred went about their toil as usual.
But on the following Sabbath, the whole body of the
slaves, attended by the master or the overseer, assembled
to “sod the grave.” With prayers, exhortations, and much
singing of hymns, in the sad, wild negro airs, this final
ceremony was completed.</p>
          <p>In death as in life, the social distinctions of slavery are
carefully maintained. Laid to rest in a “potter's field,” the
dead bodies of the slaves .never mingle their dust with
that of the sovereign race. No monument, inscribed with
the name of the deceased, ever marks the spot where he
lies, as
<pb id="steve168" n="168"/>
no legal sanction was ever given to his name while he
lived. A rough stone, gathered from the wayside, or a
branch of cedar, soon to die, is his only monument. So
perish, an undistinguishable throng, the enslaved race of
the South. For two centuries the long and ever swelling
procession has been moving on in its weary path to the
grave, but no name of them all survive, save where, here
and there, one has escaped out of the American Egypt,
or, Spartacus-like, has risen to take bloody vengeance on
his oppressors. A race of many millions has mingled in
the very thick of American civilization reaching even into
the nineteenth century, and yet their place in human
history is a blank.</p>
          <p>When Anthony had ended his year of service with
Foote, he found a new master in Falmouth. This man, not
having employment enough for him, re-let him at the end
of six months to a wholesale merchant. The latter proved
to be a harsh master, and Anthony refused to remain
beyond the expiration of his time, much to the merchant's
disappointment. With the new year, he entered the
service of a tavern-keeper in Fredericksburg. The annual
income which his owner derived from his services had
now risen to one hundred dollars, notwithstanding the
drawback caused by his lame hand. At the end of the
year, true to his secret purpose of frequently changing
his place, he sought and obtained a new situation in the
establishment of an apothecary in Fredericksburg. While
there, an incident occurred that made all his hopes of
<pb id="steve169" n="169"/>
freedom to bud and blossom afresh. Going into the
kitchen of his employer one day, he found there a fortune-
teller who at once beset him to cross her palm with his
shilling. With some reluctance Anthony consented, and
the woman proceeded to flatter him with the usual
nonsense about love. But Anthony waited with secret
anxiety to hear if she would prophesy to him of freedom;
and when at length she did promise him that long
dreamed of bliss, he almost fainted with the rush of
emotion. Not content with uttering an indefinite
prediction, she even fixed the period when he should
become a freeman, and fixed it only a few months
forward. Was it strange that a slave, panting to breathe
the air of liberty, should catch at such a straw? With
increasing restlessness he looked forward to the
predicted time. When it had passed and he still remained
in slavery as before, his faith in fortune-telling was
naturally staggered. But a change in his circumstances
occurred about this time that contributed to keep alive,
and even to strengthen, his hopes.</p>
          <p>Col. Suttle had hitherto managed the hiring of his own
slaves; he now appointed William Brent his agent for
that purpose. The latter having at length discovered that
work and not sport is the law of life, had removed from
Falmouth to Richmond and entered the service of his
brother-in-law as a clerk. He now sent for Anthony for
the purpose of hiring him out in the latter city. This was
welcome intelligence, for, besides placing him in a
<pb id="steve170" n="170"/>
community where he was unknown, the change would
bring him to the very side of the ships that might help
him wing his way to the North. Accordingly, at the close
of the year, he set out for the metropolis of Virginia,
having under his charge four other slaves belonging to
Col. Suttle, also bound for the hiring-ground.</p>
          <p>The trust committed to him on this occasion was but
one proof of the high place which Anthony held in his
owner's esteem. As he had grown up, his superiority,
natural and acquired, to the other slaves of Col. Suttle,
had become more and more manifest, and in the end he
was made a supervisor over the whole. He found them
new masters at the end of the year; if anything went
amiss with them, it was to him that the owner or his
agent looked for an account. Once a year, there was a 
re-union of Col. Suttle and all his slaves. The scene was
a little cabin in Stafford where Anthony's mother, now
verging upon fourscore, and his sister, a breeding-woman,
had their quarters. To this centre, the hired
slaves, under the superintendence of Anthony, were
required to repair at the close of the year, however
distant they might be. The owner met them, saw for
himself their personal condition, and received reports of
what had transpired in respect to themselves. If any had
been sick, or had fallen into difficulties with their
employers, or had been punished by the authorities, this
was the time for explanation. The interview ended with a
<sic>dotation</sic> from Col. Suttle
<pb id="steve171" n="171"/>
of a dime, or some other small coin, to each. Usually, this
was the only time in the year when he and his slaves met
each other face to face.</p>
          <p>On arriving in Richmond, Anthony found that a
master had already been provided for himself in the
person of Brent's brother-in-law. A day's acquaintance
satisfied him that they would never get on harmoniously
together, and he refused his assent to the arrangement.
In the mean time, he busied himself with providing
situations for the slaves that had been placed in his
charge. Having accomplished this, he then found a place
for himself with the proprietor of a large flouring
establishment where an elder brother was already
employed. All being thus happily provided for by the
enterprise and address of Anthony, nothing remained
for the agent Brent but to execute the contracts in
writing.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile he had continued to make progress in his
education. At Acquia, in Culpepper, in Falmouth, and in
Fredericksburg, he had found one and another to assist
him in the struggle. The spelling-book had been
mastered, and the New Testament had begun to yield up
its meaning to his patient application. At length he
essayed a bolder flight. A part of his business had
usually been to fetch his master's letters from the
post-office. One day the thought struck him that if he
were able to write, he too might send letters to his
friends, and no one be the wiser. He resolved, if it were
possible, to learn the precious art. He gathered from the
street some torn scraps of paper
<pb id="steve172" n="172"/>
with writing upon them, and carefully imitated the
characters. These rude copies he ventured to show to a
young lady whom he had known as a child at Miss
Horton's school. His confidence was not misplaced;
although contrary to Virginia law, she kindly explained
their meaning and lent him further aid. Thus, by the time
he arrived in Richmond, he was already able to read and
to write with a considerable degree of correctness. Such
unusual attainments gave him a position in that city
which he did not fail to improve to his own advantage, as
well as that of others. He set up a school for the
instruction of slaves—old as well as young—in reading.
When the labors of the day were over, he was wont to
meet twelve or fifteen in the house of a free negro woman
for that purpose. This practice he continued for several
months, and while it directly promoted his mental
improvement, it was also a source of pecuniary profit.</p>
          <p>At the end of his first year in Richmond, he changed
his masters for the last time. His new employer was a
druggist named Millspaugh. In about a week after
Anthony had entered upon his new engagement,
Millspaugh took him aside, and proposed a different
arrangement. He had expected, he said, to have had
employment enough to keep Anthony constantly busy,
but found that such was not the case, and that he was
likely to lose money by retaining him. He proposed,
therefore, that Anthony should take the matter into his
<pb id="steve173" n="173"/>
own hands on these conditions: That he should pay to
Millspaugh the sum ($125), which Col. Suttle was to
receive, that he should clothe himself, and, finally,
that he should pay Millspaugh a bonus, the amount
of which was left to Anthony's generosity. He was to
seek jobs here and there in the city, and every evening
pay to his master a certain sum from his earnings. This
arrangement, Millspaugh informed him, was in
violation of law, and must of course be kept secret;
nor, as Anthony understood, was it ever made known to
Suttle or to Brent. He joyfully accepted the proposal, and
with new springs of life went forth to seek work, which
had thus suddenly become his best friend. It soon
appeared, however, that the arrangement to pay
Millspaugh every night would be inconvenient, and
even impossible, since his daily earnings were variable,
and on some days he had failed of a job altogether. It
was therefore arranged that he should make a payment to
his master at the end of every fortnight.</p>
          <p>All this while, the great purpose of his life had had
been fast ripening for action. He had now dwelt a year in
the midst of circumstances that strongly fostered its
<sic>developement</sic>. He was in daily sight of those northern
keels that seemed to him a part of the very soil of
freedom. He was in daily converse with men whose
birthright was in a free land, and whose language to the
slave had no smack of the whip. Kindhearted sailors,
having no vessels to forfeit, and no trade to compromise,
<pb id="steve174" n="174"/>
did not hesitate to urge him on to flight. Plainly,
the time was at hand, when, if ever, he was to achieve his
freedom.</p>
          <p>One very serious obstacle lay in his path, and must be
overcome. As already narrated, he had become a member
of the church, and more than that, a preacher of the
gospel. Was it right for him to run away from his owner?
The question troubled him. He could not bring reproach
upon the sacred cause he had espoused; if he fled from
slavery, it must be with a clear conscience. To resolve his
doubts, he searched the Scriptures. He fell upon the
Epistle to Philemon, which has furnished so much
comfort to pious slaveholders, and, strangely enough, it
relieved and comforted Anthony also. For he read that
though Paul had sent back a runaway slave, it was that
he should be no longer a slave, but a brother beloved
unto his former master. Still pursuing his investigations,
he met with the case of the bond-woman Hagar, whom,
when she had fled from hard usage, the angel of the Lord
had commanded to return and become submissive to her
mistress. This seemed to contradict the principle
inculcated by Paul, and in his perplexity Anthony applied
to others for light. They summarily expounded the
passage as a divine sanction to the slave code of the Old
Dominion. Not satisfied—as how could he be with what
would wither his now brightly blooming hopes—Anthony
searched further, and reflected with deeper earnestness.
As the result of
<pb id="steve175" n="175"/>
his inquiries, he found that the Bible set forth only one
God for the black and the white races, that He had made
of one blood all the nations of the earth, that there was
no divine ordinance requiring one part of the human
family to be in bondage to another, and that there was no
passage of Holy Writ by virtue of which Col. Suttle could
claim a right of property in him, any more than he could
in Col. Suttle. These considerations ended his doubts.
Paul was on his side, the whole spirit of the Gospel
sanctioned his desires, and he deliberately dismissed
Hagar from his thoughts. From that moment, with a clear
conscience and full integrity of Christian character, he
applied himself to the recovery of his inalienable right to
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
          <p>The new arrangement for paying Millspaugh was
highly favorable to the success of his plans. So long as
he was required to reckon every night, there was little
chance of making good his escape. His failure to appear
would have been remarked by his expectant master, and
continued absence would have been followed by speedy
search. But now, he was not expected until the end of a
fortnight; nor would suspicion be excited if he were not
seen during that interval. A fortnight's start in the race
for freedom was, under ordinary circumstances, more
than enough to place him upon the soil of New England,
and it was his. This fair prospect was suddenly
obscured. At the end of the first month, Anthony paid to
his master twenty-five
<pb id="steve176" n="176"/>
dollars, showing that he was earning at the rate of
three hundred dollars a year. This fact seemed to put a
new thought into Millspaugh's head. He revoked his
permission for settlements once a fortnight, and not only
required them to be made daily, as at first, but also
required that the whole sum of one hundred and twenty-five 
dollars should be paid as fast as possible. Did he
design, when that was paid, to ignore the unlawful
bargain with his slave, and appropriate his earnings for
the remainder of the year? Whatever his secret purpose,
it was effectually baulked. Anthony strenuously objected
to the arrangement, and finally left Millspaugh's presence
without giving his consent. But he saw that the crisis had
come, and he proceeded to act accordingly.</p>
          <p>On becoming master of his own time, according to the
arrangement with Millspaugh, he had sought and
obtained employment on the vessels lying at the
wharves. Much of the time, he was on board assisting to
discharge cargoes of coals, guano, and other lading. He
was thus brought into familiar intercourse with the
sailors, and with one in particular he was soon on the
most confidential terms. The subject of his bondage was
broached, and his aspirations for freedom were
disclosed. The sympathetic sailor entered heartily into
his views, and a plan for his escape had already been
concerted, when Millspaugh's change of purpose
suddenly precipitated its execution. Although Anthony
had refused his assent to the new arrangement, yet he
<pb id="steve177" n="177"/>
had every reason to fear that it would be enforced
notwithstanding his remonstrances. He would thus be
required to appear daily in his master's presence. But he
imagined that for the first few days his failure to do so
would naturally be attributed to his reluctance on this
point, and so suspicion would be disarmed. This
precious interval he now resolved should witness his
departure from slave-land.</p>
          <p>At the very last, a sharp struggle awaited him. Love,
which does not discriminate between black and white,
bond and free, had made a conquest of Anthony. He had
formed an attachment to a bond-woman of his own race,
and there was before him a bright prospect of soon
enjoying the highest solace which slave life affords. To
sunder this tender tie was hard, but to forego the
prospect of liberty was harder still. Besides, his desire for
freedom had by this time assumed a high moral
character; as a Christian man, his soul was fettered; as
one seeking to benefit his fellow-men, he found himself
under restraints too great to be borne. The higher motive
triumphed, love was sacrificed on the altar of liberty.</p>
          <p>The third night after his last interview with
Millspaugh was fixed upon for putting his purpose into
execution; it was one of the early days in February, 1854.
His lodging-place was in Millspaugh's house, directly
over that person's chamber. Gathering some few effects
into a small bundle, he encased himself in four suits of
clothes—the
<pb id="steve178" n="178"/>
outer suit being the coarse garb in which he performed
his daily toil—and lay down to pass a sleepless night. In
the same room, a roguish young negro boy was
accustomed to sleep, by whom there was danger that his
strange plight would be discovered. Fortunately, no
detection took place. An hour before daylight, he rose
and took his way about a mile to the wharves. Had he
found any persons around, it was his purpose to have
gone to work as usual. Finding the coast clear, he rapidly
passed on board the vessel to which his sailor-friend
belonged, and was quickly stowed away in a place of
concealment previously prepared by the latter.</p>
          <p>The vessel did not sail that day, as had been expected,
and, while she still lay at the wharf, sleep fell upon
Anthony, already exhausted by watching. When he
again awoke, she was ten or fifteen miles down the river,
under full sail. Contrary winds retarded the voyage, and
the roughened waters caused the vessel to pitch and
toss at an unusual rate. The effect produced upon
Anthony's physical system was too much for his
endurance. Shut up in a dark hole, where he was
compelled to lie constantly in one position, and left for
several days without a morsel of food, he had to
undergo, in addition, the pangs of sea-sickness,
redoubled by the other miseries of his situation, and by
their very strangeness. In his extreme misery, he
entreated his friend to put him on shore and leave him to
his fate; but this was impossible. At the
<pb id="steve179" n="179"/>
end of two days the vessel reached Norfolk, where she
lay to for a short time, and then resumed her voyage for
Boston. The ordinary time for the passage was from ten
to fourteen days, but for three weeks Anthony was
tossed upon the ocean before he again set foot on land.
During all that time he never once left his narrow hiding-
place, nor was he able to change his position in the least
degree. Lying constantly on one side, he for a time
entirely lost the use of his right arm. Bread and water
were his only nourishment, and these he received only at
intervals of three or four days, as his friend found
opportunity to convey them to him by stealth. For, from
first to last, neither the captain nor any officer was aware
of his being on board. As the vessel passed into the
more northern latitudes, he was assailed by a degree of
cold such as his southern life had ill fitted him to endure,
and, before the voyage was ended, his feet were frozen
stiff in his boots.</p>
          <p>At length, somewhere in the last days of February or
first of March, the vessel touched her wharf at Boston.
Seizing a favorable opportunity, Anthony succeeded in
getting on shore unobserved. It was in the gray of the
morning, and few people were moving. Assuming the air
of a seaman, he inquired his way to a boarding-house,
and was soon provided for. A week elapsed before he
was sufficiently recovered of his bruises to move about
with any comfort. He then sought for employment, and at
length secured the situation of a cook
<pb id="steve180" n="180"/>
on board a mud-scow. In the discharge of his new duties
everything succeeded satisfactorily but one—he was
unable to make his bread rise. This was a fatal defect,
and at the end of a week he was discharged. His next
permanent employment was that in which he was found
by the slave-hunter.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45">1</ref><note id="note45" n="45" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref45">1 The discovery of his place of refuge was made by means of a
letter which he wrote to his brother in Richmond, and which he
had incautiously dated at Boston, while taking care to have it
postmarked in Canada. It of course first fell into the hands of his
brother's master, who communicated the contents to Brent or
Suttle.</note> I now resume the narrative of his
extradition.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
          <head>THE TRADER'S JAIL.</head>
          <p>A SHORT distance down the harbor, the United States
revenue cutter was lying to, in readiness to receive its
prey. Col. Suttle and his witness Brent were already on
board. Their absence from the court-room, at the
rendering of the decision, had been remarked; the more,
as it was in striking contrast with their sedulous
attendance on all the previous days of the trial. It was
afterward ascertained that they had quietly left their hotel
at early dawn on the same morning, passed over to the
Navy Yard at Charlestown, and from thence had been
transported with their baggage to the revenue cutter.
That the claimant of Burns should thus calmly turn his
back upon the court in the very crisis of his cause, that
the commander of a national vessel should thus place it
at the service of a private citizen without any ostensible
warrant, were significant facts. The public placed but
one construction upon the proceeding; they saw in it
conclusive proof that the Commissioner had privately
made known his decision to one of the interested parties
before he declared it in open court.</p>
          <p>The steamer was soon placed alongside the cutter,
<pb id="steve182" n="182"/>
to which Burns was immediately transferred, together
with Deputy Marshal Riley, Butman, and four others,
who had been detailed to escort the slave back to
Virginia. The cutter was then taken in tow by the steamer,
and together they passed down the harbor. At the end of
a few miles, the two vessels cast loose from each other, a
parting salute was fired, and the steamer returned to
disembark the soldiers and cannon, while the cutter
pursued its solitary course for Virginia.</p>
          <p>On entering the cabin of the cutter, Anthony found
himself once more face to face with Col. Suttle. “How do
you do, ‘Tony?” was the latter's salutation. A private
conference between Col. Suttle and the Marshal ensued,
during which Butman and others were banished from the
cabin. After the departure of the Marshal, Col. Suttle
proceeded to interrogate Burns respecting his escape. He
offered to give him his freedom, if he would divulge the
name of the captain who brought him off from Virginia.
To disarm and conciliate Burns, he prefaced his question
with a testimony to the truthfulness of the latter.</p>
          <p>“This boy,” said he to the bystanders, “has always
been an honest, upright servant, and I have never
known him to tell a lie.”</p>
          <p>To the demand for the captain's name, Burns replied,
simply and truthfully, “I do not know it.”</p>
          <p>Thereupon Col. Suttle, in the face of his previous
testimony, expressed a doubt of his truthfulness. But
Burns persisted then, and ever afterward,
<pb id="steve183" n="183"/>
in asserting his ignorance of the captain's name. It
had never been a matter of curiosity with him; he had
never seen the captain while on board his ship, and
probably not at any other time. Failing to obtain any light
from Anthony, Col. Suttle gave vent to his vindictive
feelings toward the unknown and really innocent
captain.</p>
          <p>“If I knew the scoundrel,” said he, “he <sic corr="wouldn't">would n't</sic>
want to bring off another negro. I would put him in the
Penitentiary for life.”</p>
          <p>“He ought to be,” responded the zealous Butman;
and he added that on arriving at Richmond he thought
he should be able to find him out.</p>
          <p>A slight incident showed that those by whom Burns
was surrounded regarded him with no friendly spirit. On
taking up his hat, which he had laid aside, he found in it
a letter. He forthwith took it to Col. Suttle, explaining to
him the circumstances under which it had been found. It
proved to contain a written speech purporting to have
been delivered by Burns against Col. Suttle and the laws
of the land. The author was never discovered; his object
plainly was to prejudice Col. Suttle against the friendless
fugitive.</p>
          <p>During the voyage, Anthony had abundant leisure
for reflection. Uncertainty respecting the fate that
awaited him weighed down his spirits and filled him with
fears. Would he be whipped? Would he be imprisoned?
Would he be sold and sent to the far South? Would his
life be sacrificed?</p>
          <pb id="steve184" n="184"/>
          <p>Once, when Col. Suttle was sitting upon deck, he
approached and said:</p>
          <p>“Master Charles, what are you going to do with me?”</p>
          <p>“What do you think I <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to do, ‘Tony?”</p>
          <p>“I expect you will sell me.”</p>
          <p>Col. Suttle replied that Anthony had caused him great
expense, that his lawyers' fees alone had been four
hundred dollars; but he left unanswered the slave's
anxious inquiry.</p>
          <p>On arriving at a point off New York Bay, the cutter fell
in with a steamer bound for that city. By this time, Suttle
and Brent had become thoroughly seasick, and they
improved the opportunity to leave the cutter, intending
to make the remainder of their journey overland. After
their departure, the situation of Anthony became less
agreeable. He had hitherto enjoyed the freedom of the
vessel; now he was restricted to a certain part of it. He
was required to take his meals by himself. No one looked
kindly upon him but the sailors that manned the vessel.
The departure of Col. Suttle was also the signal for Butman
and his coadjutors to beset Anthony afresh. They importuned
him to tell them the whole matter, now that it was ended;
and they were especially curious to ascertain if the witnesses
in behalf of Burns had told the truth. Again they renewed
their protestations of friendship; in proof of it, they
reminded Anthony that it was they who had procured for
him new clothes and supplied him with money. They
at length
<pb id="steve185" n="185"/>
proceeded to tempt him with a proposition in full keeping
with the infamy of their own course. They assured him
that they would procure his immediate freedom, provided
he would return and assist them in catching fugitive
slaves. To strengthen the lure, they informed him that
one negro in Boston had engaged in the business, and
grown rich by so doing. But Burns understood his men,
and was fully proof against their machinations.</p>
          <p>“You wish,” said he, “to get out of me all that you
can, for the purpose of injuring my friends in
Massachusetts, and then you will leave me to die in
Virginia. I know I am green; but, mark me, I am ripe
enough for you in this matter.”</p>
          <p>On Saturday, after a voyage of eight days, the vessel
arrived at Norfolk. Informed by telegraph of Burns's
departure from Boston, the Virginia city was already
awaiting his appearance. Although Richmond was the
destination of the fugitive, yet Norfolk was determined to
share in the triumph of her sister city. On two former
occasions she had been baulked in her attempts to
recover fugitives from Massachusetts on her own
account, and the failure had only increased her
eagerness.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46">1</ref><note id="note46" n="46" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref46">1 Latimer, whom Gov. Davis declined to surrender to the
Governor of Virginia in 1843, when requisition was made
on the false pretence that he was a fugitive from <hi rend="italics">justice,</hi> and
Shadrach, who was the first fugitive slave arrested in
Massachusetts after the passage of the Act of 1850, and who
made good his escape from the officer,—were both Norfolk
slaves.</note> Accordingly, as the vessel drew to land, the
officers of the city went on board and taking possession
of Anthony, carried
<pb id="steve186" n="186"/>
him off to the jail. A crowd followed them through the
streets, anxious to catch a glimpse of the “Boston Lion,”
as their excited imaginations led them to style him. He
was thrown into the common jail, where he was kept in
solitude for two days, without bed or seat, and with only
a single meal during the whole period. It was the first
greeting which slave-land gave to its recovered slave—
starvation in prison. On Monday, the voyage was
resumed, and the same day Burns was landed on the
wharf at the capital of Virginia.</p>
          <p>It was expected that Brent would meet the party on
their arrival in Richmond, but he failed to make his
appearance. They therefore took a carriage and were
driven immediately to the principal hotel of the city.
There the deputy marshal and his aids took lodgings, but
Burns was delivered into the custody of an officer, by
whom he was forthwith lodged in the common jail for
safe keeping.</p>
          <p>The Federal Government had at length performed the
task which it had undertaken. A vast amount of money
had been expended; time, human life, the national
reputation, and the law of nature had been sacrificed in
order to restore a single slave to his master: but it was
thought that the political well-being of the nation
required it all. The result demonstrated that the fugitive
slave act was the most costly, as it was the most
infamous, upon the statute-book; and it produced the
certain conviction that the next attempt to execute it in
the
<pb id="steve187" n="187"/>
Commonwealth of Massachusetts would prove more
costly still.</p>
          <p>In the jail, Anthony remained uncared for during ten
days. He was indulged with the freedom of the jail-yard
and no task was assigned him. A moderate allowance
of coarse food, twice a day, was all that he had to satisfy
his hunger. On being incarcerated, his person was
searched and his knife and some money were taken from
him. These were never restored, southern jailers not
disdaining to rob even slaves of their small possessions.
At the end of ten days, Brent presented himself at the jail.
He was in no gracious mood. Incidentally, he had been
informed that Anthony had denied to some persons
having any acquaintance with him. To be ignored by a
slave under his own charge was too much for the
equanimity of Mr. Brent, and, on first meeting Anthony,
he compromised his dignity by betraying the cause of his
spleen. The ruffled feathers were smoothed by a quiet
denial of the absurd accusation on the part of Burns.</p>
          <p>Brent was accompanied to the jail by one Robert
Lumpkin, a noted trader in slaves. This man belonged to
a class of persons by whose society the slaveholders of
the South profess to feel disgraced, but with whose
services, nevertheless, they cannot dispense. He had
formerly been engaged exclusively in the traffic in slaves.
Roaming over the country, and picking up a husband
here, a wife there, a mother in one place, and an alluring
<pb id="steve188" n="188"/>
maiden in another, he banded them with iron links into a
coffle and sent them to the far southern market. By his
ability and success in this remorseless business, he had
greatly distinguished himself, and had come to be known
as a “bully trader.” At this time, however, he had
abandoned the business of an itinerant trader, and was
established in Richmond as the proprietor of a Trader's
Jail. In this he kept and furnished with board such slaves
as were brought into the city for sale, and, generally, all
such as their owners wished to punish or to provide with
temporary safe keeping. He also kept a boarding-house
for the owners themselves. Lumpkin's Jail was one of the
prominent and characteristic features of the capital of
Virginia. It was a large brick structure, three stories in
height, situated in the outskirts of Richmond, and
surrounded by an acre of ground. The whole was
enclosed by a high, close fence, the top of which was
thickly set with iron spikes.</p>
          <p>To the proprietor of this prison, Burns was now
delivered up by Brent. He was ordered by Lumpkin to put
his hands behind him; this done, the jail-keeper
proceeded to fasten them together in that position with a
pair of iron handcuffs. Then, directing Anthony to move
on before, he followed him closely behind until they
arrived at his jail.</p>
          <p>Here he was destined to suffer, for four months, such
revolting treatment as the vilest felons never undergo,
and such as only revengeful slaveholders can inflict. The
place of his confinement was a
<pb id="steve189" n="189"/>
room only six or eight feet square, in the upper
story of the jail, which was accessible only through a
trap-door. He was allowed neither bed nor
air; a rude bench fastened against the wall and
a single, coarse blanket were the only means of
repose. After entering his cell, the handcuffs were not
removed, but, in addition, fetters were placed upon
his feet. In this manacled condition he was kept
during the greater part of his confinement. The
torture which he suffered, in consequence, was
excruciating. The gripe of the irons impeded the
circulation of his blood, made hot and rapid by the
stifling atmosphere, and caused his feet to swell
enormously. The flesh was worn from his wrists,
and when the wounds had healed, there remained
broad scars as perpetual witnesses against his owner.
The fetters also prevented him from removing his
clothing by day or night, and no one came to help him;
the indecency resulting from such a condition is too
revolting for description, or even thought.
His room became more foul and noisome than the hovel
of a brute; loathsome creeping things multiplied and
rioted in the filth. His food consisted of a piece of
coarse corn-bread and the parings of bacon or putrid
meat. This fare, supplied to him once a day, he was
compelled to devour without Plate, knife, or fork.
Immured, as he was, in a narrow, unventilated room,
beneath the heated roof of the jail, a constant supply of
fresh water would have been a heavenly boon; but the
only means of quenching his thirst was the nauseating
contents
<pb id="steve190" n="190"/>
of a pail that was replenished only once or twice a week.
Living under such an accumulation of atrocities, he at
length fell seriously ill. This brought about some
mitigation of his treatment; his fetters were removed for a
time, and he was supplied with broth, which, compared
with his previous food, was luxury itself.</p>
          <p>When first confined in the jail, he became an object of
curiosity to all who had heard of his case, and twenty or
thirty persons in a day would call to gaze upon him. On
these occasions, his fetters were taken off and he was
conducted down to the piazza in front of the jail. His
visitors improved the opportunity to express their opinion
of his deserts; having no pecuniary interest in his life,
they were anxious that it should be sacrificed for the
general good of slaveholders. When curiosity was
satisfied, he would be led back to his cell, and again
placed in irons. These exhibitions occurred ordinarily
once a day during the first two or three weeks, and,
though humiliating, furnished a relief to the solitude of
his confinement. There were other slaves in the jail, who
were allowed more or less intercourse with each other;
but between them and Burns all communication was
strictly prohibited. The taint of freedom was upon him,
and infection was dreaded.</p>
          <p>His residence in the jail gave him an opportunity of
gaining new views of the system of slavery. One day his
attention was attracted by a noise in the room beneath
him. There was a sound as of
<pb id="steve191" n="191"/>
a woman entreating and sobbing, and of a man
addressing to her commands mingled with oaths.
Looking down through a crevice in the floor, Burns
beheld a slave woman stark naked in the presence of two
men. One of them was an overseer, and the other a
person who had come to purchase a slave. The overseer
had compelled the woman to disrobe in order that the
purchaser might see for himself whether she was well
formed and sound in body. Burns was horror-stricken; all
his previous experience had not made him aware of such
an outrage. This, however, was not an exceptional case;
he found it was the ordinary custom in Lumpkin's jail
thus to expose the naked person of the slave, both male
and female, to the inspection of the purchaser. A wider
range of observation would have enabled him to see that
it was the universal custom in the slave states.</p>
          <p>In spite of the interdict under which he was laid, Burns
found a method of communicating with other slaves in
the jail. It has been stated that during his illness he was
released from his fetters and supplied with broth. The
spoon given him to eat with, on that occasion, he
contrived to secrete, and when alone, he used it in
enlarging a small hole in the floor. It was just behind the
trap-door, by which, when thrown open, it was entirely
hidden from view, and thus escaped discovery. Through
this hole Burns made known his situation to some slaves
in a room below, and at once enlisted their sympathies.
The intercourse thus established was
<pb id="steve192" n="192"/>
afterward regularly maintained. To avoid detection, it was
carried on only at dead of night; then, throwing himself
prostrate upon the floor and applying his mouth to the
aperture, Burns whiled away hour after hour in converse
with his more fortunate fellow bondmen. He filled their
eager and wondering ears with the story of his escape
from bondage, his free and happy life at the North, his
capture, and the mighty effort that it cost the Government
to restore him to Virginia. He was their Columbus, telling
them of the land, to them unknown, which he had visited;
inspiring them with longings to follow in his track; and
warning them, out of his own experience, of the perils to
be avoided. On their part, they communicated to him such
information as their less restricted condition had enabled
them to obtain. Conversation was not the only advantage
that he derived from this quarter. His new friends
furnished him with tobacco and matches, so that, during
the long night watches, he was able to solace himself by
smoking.</p>
          <p>After a while, he found a friend in the family of
Lumpkin. The wife of this man was a “yellow woman”
whom he had married as much from necessity as from
choice, the white women of the South refusing to connect
themselves with professed slave traders. This woman
manifested her compassion for Burns by giving him a
testament and a hymn-book. Upon most slaves these gifts
would have been thrown away; fortunately for Burns, he
had learned to read, and the books proved a very
<pb id="steve193" n="193"/>
treasure. Besides the yellow wife, Lumpkin had a black
concubine, and she also manifested a friendly spirit
toward the prisoner. The house of Lumpkin was
separated from the jail only by the yard, and from one of
the upper windows the girl contrived to hold
conversations with Anthony, whose apartment was
directly opposite. Her compassion, it is not unlikely,
changed into a warmer feeling; she was discovered one
day by her lord and master; what he overheard roused
his jealousy, and he took effectual means to break off the
intercourse.</p>
          <p>In the search of Anthony's person at the common jail,
some things had escaped discovery. He had concealed
between the parts of his clothing a little money, some
writing paper, and a pen, and these he still retained. Ink
only was wanting, and this, through the aid of his prison
friends, he also secured. Thus furnished, he wrote several
letters to his friends at a distance; in all there were six,
two of which were addressed to persons in Boston. To
secure their transmission to the post-office, he adopted
the following method: The letter was fastened to a piece
of brick dug from the wall; then watching at his window
until he saw some negro passing outside the jail fence, he
contrived by signs to attract his attention and throw to
him the letter. The passer-by was in all probability an
entire stranger, as well as a person unable to read, yet
Burns trusted, not unreasonably, that his wishes would
be rightly interpreted, and that his
<pb id="steve194" n="194"/>
letters would reach the post-office. No answers were
expected in return, none would have reached him had
they been written. The postmaster at the South, albeit an
officer of the Federal Government, is not the less an
obsequious servant of the slaveholder. If a letter
addressed to a slave bears a southern post-mark, it is
delivered to its claimant without question; but when the
post-mark indicates a northern origin, the postmaster
withholds it from the claimant, inquires his master's name,
and then deposits it in the latter's box. If the letter is
found to be objectionable, it is destroyed and nothing is
said about it; if otherwise, the master reads to his slave
such portions as he sees fit. One of the letters written by
Burns was addressed to Col. Suttle, giving an account of
his illness. Suttle immediately wrote to Brent upon the
subject, and the confounded agent hastened to the jail for
an explanation. Burns frankly told him of the manner in
which he had despatched his letters to the post-office,
and enjoyed not a little his visitor's astonishment at the
revelation. The consequence was that Brent deprived him
of his pen in the vain hope of putting an end to his letter-
writing.</p>
          <p>After lying in the jail four months, his imprisonment
came to an end. It had been determined to sell him, and
the occurrence of a fair in Richmond presented a
favorable opportunity. Accordingly, his manacles were
knocked off, his person was put in decent trim, and he
was led forth to the auction room. A large crowd of
persons was already assembled.</p>
          <pb id="steve195" n="195"/>
          <p>As he stepped upon the auction block, he saw
standing a few feet off, Col. Suttle, who at once
saluted him with the old, “How d'ye do, ‘Tony?” This
was the first interview between master and slave that had
taken place since Col. Suttle left the revenue cutter for
New York. Presently the auctioneer ordered him to face
round, and Col. Suttle, was lost to his view. While thus
standing, the voice of Col. Suttle fell upon his ear, saying
to the auctioneer, “Don't sell him to a Yankee trader.”
Glancing his eyes one side, Burns caught another sight
of his master; it proved to be the last, as the words
addressed to the auctioneer were the last words that
Burns ever heard him speak. Vindictiveness toward the
offending slave, and bad faith toward the North, marked
the spirit in which Col. Suttle finally severed the relation
between himself and Anthony Burns.</p>
          <p>The elevation of Burns upon the block, in full view,
was the signal for an explosion of wrathful feeling. Angry
speeches were made about him and he was personally
insulted. The violence of one encouraged that of another,
and the tumult, momently increasing, threatened to burst
over all bounds. For awhile, Burns stood in imminent peril
of his life. With much ado, the more rational portion
succeeded at length in calming the fury of the rest, and
the auction was allowed to proceed. It was commenced
by a bid of ten dollars from the auctioneer. No one
offered more, and for a
<pb id="steve196" n="196"/>
long time the sale hung on that bid. At length the
auctioneer bethought him to mention that Burns was a
preacher. This caused the bidding to move on, and, in
the end, he was knocked down for $905, to David
McDaniel, of Rocky Mount, North Carolina. Four months
before, Col. Suttle had refused to accept twelve hundred
dollars from the northern friends of Burns. Meanwhile he
had lost the interest on that amount, had lost the
services of his slave for that length of time, and for that
length of time had been compelled to pay his board. The
whole transaction, while it revealed the true character of
Col. Suttle, furnished an impressive illustration of
slaveholding thrift.</p>
          <p>The sale was no sooner over, than Burns was hurried
back to his old quarters in the jail. Thither his new owner
shortly followed, and in a personal interview made
known his wishes.</p>
          <p>“I understand,” said he to Burns, “that you are a
preacher. Now, I have a great many other slaves, and you
are not to preach to them. If you want to preach to
anybody, preach to me.”</p>
          <p>He demanded of his new slave a pledge that he would
conform to this requirement. Anthony refused to give it,
but at the same time promised to be a faithful servant so
long as he should remain with McDaniel, provided he
was well used. Otherwise, he distinctly avowed his
determination to run away on the first opportunity. This
frankness pleased the slaveholder. His countenance
relaxed, and telling Anthony that he liked his pluck, he
declared
<pb id="steve197" n="197"/>
that he had no fears of his running away. The
interview resulted in establishing between them a good
understanding that was never afterward seriously
interrupted.</p>
          <p>To avoid the hazards of a mob, McDaniel found it
prudent to remove his obnoxious slave from the city by
night. About three o'clock in the morning, the two stole
forth from the jail and made their way to the railroad
station. Taking passage in the next train, they were soon
set down at Rocky Mount in the northeastern part of
North Carolina. McDaniel's plantation lay at a distance of
three or four miles, and thither they were conveyed in a
private vehicle.</p>
        </div2>

          <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
          <head>THE RANSOMED FREEDMAN.</head>
          <p>AT Rocky Mount, Burns entered on the last stage of
his life as a slave. He was there introduced to new scenes
and subjected to new influences. His new master was a
different person from Col. Suttle. He possessed a more
marked character, and a far greater capacity for business.
In person he was short but stout, with a large head, and a
countenance indicative of firmness, courage, and
decision. He had an iron will that was made the law for all
within his sphere; but he could appreciate and honor
manly qualities in others. While his sharp, stern style of
address would cause most persons to shrink away, he
was not displeased when any one had the courage to
stand up and confront him with manly self-assertion.
Though he practically manifested but little respect for the
<sic>decalogue</sic>, he made it a point of honor to fulfill his
engagements.</p>
          <p>The business of Mr. McDaniel was that of a planter,
slave-trader, and horse-dealer combined. He possessed
an extensive plantation, which was chiefly devoted to the
culture of cotton. For the management of this, he kept
constantly in his service
<pb id="steve199" n="199"/>
a large body of slaves. The number of these was
constantly changing. Sometimes there would be as many
as one hundred and fifty on the plantation at once;
sometimes not more than seventy-five. This fluctuation
was owing to the purchase and sale that was constantly
going on. The plantation was made subservient to the
slave-trading, The slaves were always for sale, but, while
waiting for customers, they were kept at work instead of
lying idle in barracoons. When a customer offered, he
was accommodated, and when the stock ran low, it was
replenished.</p>
          <p>The domestic relations of McDaniel were in keeping
with his character and pursuits. His wife stood in great
fear of him. She presided over his household, but neither
inspired nor enjoyed his respect. The tender bond of
children was also wanting between them. He kept a harem
of black girls, and took no pains to conceal the fact from
his wife. By some of these, children were born to him, but,
true to his instincts as a slave-trader, he made
merchandise of them and their mothers without
compunction.</p>
          <p>The post which was assigned to Burns by his new
owner was that of coachman and stable-keeper. As a
horse-dealer, McDaniel kept on hand a large stock of
horses and mules, often as many as a hundred at once.
The stables of these animals were placed under the
charge of Burns, and he held the keys. But he was
required to groom and serve only the carriage-horses
and his master's
<pb id="steve200" n="200"/>
filly; the rest of the animals were cared for by other
slaves. Whenever his mistress was inclined to take an
airing, or visit a neighbor, or ride to church, it devolved
on him to drive her carriage. The whole service which he
was thus required to perform was light and pleasant.</p>
          <p>His personal accommodations were better than they
had ever been before. Instead of being compelled to turn
in with the slaves at their quarters, he had a lodging
assigned him in an office, and partook of his meals in the
master's house. He was allowed to obtain what he wanted
at a store of which McDaniel was the proprietor. His
religious privileges were less attended to. Twice only,
during his four months' servitude, was he able to attend
church on Sunday. Whenever he drove his mistress to
church, which was not often, he was required to wait with
the horses outside while she worshipped within. It has
been seen that he refused to give his owner a pledge to
refrain from preaching among the slaves. In this he was
governed by a sense of duty. He had been regularly
invested with the office of a slave-preacher, and it was his
purpose to exercise it as he had opportunity. Accordingly,
during his period of service with McDaniel, he succeeded
in holding, at various times, six or eight preaching-meetings
among the slaves on the plantation. Once he was
discovered, but his master chose to take no notice of the
offence. The manliness and general good disposition of
Burns so won his regard,
<pb id="steve201" n="201"/>
that he tolerated in him what he would have
punished in another. On his part, Burns was deeply
impressed by the liberal treatment of his master, and he
subsequently declared that he could not, in conscience,
have run away so long as it continued. It was a matter of
special favor that he was not placed under the control of
an overseer, but was held accountable only to his master.
The office in which he lodged was shared with him by
one of the overseers. This equality of their condition, or
some other cause, impelled the overseer to pick a quarrel
with Burns, and he carried it so far as once to draw a
pistol upon him. Burns made complaint of the assault to
McDaniel, from whom, in consequence, the overseer
received a stern rebuke.</p>
          <p>His relations with his mistress were less agreeable. In
striving to please his master he displeased her. McDaniel
had given him express instructions to pay no heed to her
commands, if they conflicted with his own. Once, in his
absence, she demanded of Burns his master's favorite
saddle-horse for her own use. On his refusing, she took
the animal and rode off. In the mean time, McDaniel
returned, and, finding what had happened, gave his wife
a severe reprimand and justified Burns.</p>
          <p>Buried thus in the obscurities of slavery, Anthony
remained for some months wholly lost to the knowledge
of his northern friends. All efforts on their part to
discover his retreat were fruitless. On the other hand,
several letters which he had
<pb id="steve202" n="202"/>
written to them, and which would have imparted the
desired information, never reached their destination;
probably they were never suffered to leave the post-office
in which he had deposited them. At length, an accident
revealed the place of his abode. He had one day driven his
mistress in her carriage to the house of a neighbor, and,
while sitting on the box, was pointed out to the family as
the slave whose case had excited such commotion
throughout the country. It chanced that a young lady
residing in the family heard the statement, and by her it
was repeated in a letter to her sister in Massachusetts. By
the latter the story was related in a social circle where the
Rev. G. S. Stockwell, one of the clergymen of the place,
happened to be present. This person immediately
addressed a letter to Anthony's owner, inquiring if the
slave could be purchased. An answer was promptly
returned that he might be purchased for thirteen hundred
dollars. This information was communicated to Mr. Grimes,
accompanied by a declaration that it was the purpose of
the clergyman to free Anthony, and also by an inquiry as
to the amount of money which could be obtained in
Boston for the purpose. Mr. Grimes returned answer, after
making some inquiry of former subscribers, that he
thought one half of the sum might be obtained in Boston.
It was accordingly agreed that the labor of obtaining the
whole amount should be equally divided between the two.
A fortnight after, however, Mr. Stockwell wrote Mr. Grimes
<pb id="steve203" n="203"/>
that he should try to secure seventy-five dollars for
expenses, and urged Mr. Grimes to get the thirteen
hundred dollars as soon as possible. Thus the whole
responsibility of the affair was once more thrown upon
Mr. Grimes.</p>
          <p>It was not by accident that this man became a chief
actor in the transactions narrated in this volume. His life
had been consecrated to this sort of service, and he was
now only continuing what he had long before begun. An
outline of his previous history will be a proper
introduction to the account of his further, and, as the
event proved, successful, efforts for the liberation of
Anthony Burns.</p>
          <p>Born in Virginia in the midst of slavery, though of free
parents, Leonard A. Grimes was yet slightly connected by
blood with the oppressed race. Left an orphan at the age
of ten years, he was placed in the charge of an uncle, but
the new home did not prove to be a pleasant one. Being
taken to his native place on a visit, he refused again to
become an inmate of his uncle's family, and soon after
went to reside in Washington. There he passed several
years of his life, first in the capacity of a butcher's boy
standing in the public market, and subsequently as an
apothecary's clerk. At length he attracted the favorable
regards of a slaveholder, into whose service he was
persuaded to enter upon hire. He became the confidential
agent of his employer, and a deserved favorite with all the
members of his family. But neither
<pb id="steve204" n="204"/>
gratitude for kindness, nor love of gain, could induce him
to become a participator in the great wrong of slavery.
Offered the post of overseer, which had become vacant,
with a salary tenfold his pay, he did not hesitate to refuse
it. Far enough from any taint of abolitionism at the time, a
sort of unconscious abhorrence of slavery preserved him
from the contamination.</p>
          <p>The business of his employer often led him on long
journeys through the southern States, when he was
accompanied by young Grimes. On one of these
occasions, as they were riding through a patch of forest
in North Carolina, the screams of a woman pierced their
ears. On gaining the open country, they beheld near the
road-side a female slave naked to the waist, and by her
side an overseer lashing her with his heavy thong. The
dark surface of her back was already barred with broad
red stripes, while the blood poured down her limbs and
stood in little pools at her feet. The employer of Grimes
was a humane man, though a slaveholder, and his blood
boiled at the sight. Drawing a pistol, and riding up to the
miscreant, he ordered him to desist or he would instantly
shoot him through. The overseer sullenly replied that he
was punishing the woman because she had come late to
her work. “My baby was dying, and will be dead before I
see it again,” interposed the wretched mother by way of
excuse. She was roughly ordered off to her work, and the
slaveholder,
<pb id="steve205" n="205"/>
still keeping a vigilant eye on the movements of
the overseer, rode on his way.</p>
          <p>This scene wrought a revolution in young Grimes. It
was his first vision of the bloody horrors of slavery, and
it made him the uncompromising and life-long foe of that
atrocious institution. Until now he had never been led to
reflect upon the true character of the institution of
slavery in the midst of which he had been born and
nurtured. The sight of the bleeding mother, in her double
agony of separation from her dying child and of
ignominious torture in her own person, produced a
shock that threw wide open his eyes and forever
dispelled his indifference. His physical system became
disordered; “I grew sick,” said he, “and felt a sensation
as of water running off my bowels. I longed for
permission from my employer to shoot the man dead.”</p>
          <p>Returning home, he soon had an opportunity to put in
practice the new purpose of his heart. A female slave on
a neighboring plantation had received from an overseer
thirty lashes for attending a religious meeting, and had
fled to the estate of Grimes's employer, one of whose
slaves was her husband. The case was brought to the
knowledge of Grimes, and by him she was soon put upon
the road to Canada, <sic>whither</sic> her husband shortly
followed her. This was his induction into an office in
which he afterward made full proof of his ministry to
those in bondage<corr>.</corr></p>
          <p>Leaving his employer's service, he purchased,
<pb id="steve206" n="206"/>
with his carefully saved earnings, one or two carriages
and horses, and set himself up in business as a hackman
in the city of Washington. Prosperity attended him;
carriage was added to carriage, and horse to horse, until
he became one of the foremost in his line of business.
Thus he went on for twelve years, and while his coaches
were in constant requisition by the gentry of the capital,
they were not seldom placed at the service of the fugitive
from southern bondage. The slaveholder oftentimes
pressed the seat that perhaps the day before had been
occupied by the flying slave.</p>
          <p>At length a crisis came. The wife and seven children of
a free negro were about to be sold by their master to a
southern slave trader, and sent to the far south. In his
distress, the husband and father applied to the man who
kept coaches and horses for the use of fugitive slaves.
Mr. Grimes was not backward to listen to his cry. Under
the cover of a single night's darkness, he penetrated
thirty miles into Virginia, brought off the whole imperilled
family, and while the owner's posse, in hot pursuit, were,
five hours later, blindly groping after them in
Washington, they passed in disguise almost before the
hunters' faces on their way to the northern land of
freedom. Three months after, Mr. Grimes was arrested,
taken into Virginia, and tried for his offence. The jury
found him guilty, not however in accordance with the
evidence, which totally failed, but to save their own lives
and the life of the prisoner from an infuriated mob
<pb id="steve207" n="207"/>
that had surrounded the Court House during the whole
trial, and had only been kept from invading the hall of
justice and committing murder by the presence of a strong
military force. Sentenced to hard labor for two years in the
State prison at Richmond, he there, through the
instrumentality of a godly slave, (temporarily placed there
for safe keeping and not for crime), experienced that great
spiritual change which makes all things new for the soul.
Like Paul, he straightway preached Jesus, and within two
months, five of the prisoners were made partakers with him
of that freedom wherewith Christ maketh free. Returning to
Washington at the expiration of his sentence, he prudently
abandoned the now, for him, suspicious business of a
hackman, and contented himself with the humbler
employment of jobbing about the city with a “furniture
car.” Having been admitted into the visible church, he ere
long felt a divine impulse to preach the gospel. After due
examination by a council of which the President of
Columbian College was moderator, he received license to
preach. Without abandoning the business of jobbing, he
exercised his gift of preaching as opportunity offered. But
the atmosphere of Washington did not permit him to
breathe freely, and he sought a home in a free State.</p>
          <p>Coming to Boston, he found there many fugitive
slaves, wandering as sheep without a shepherd. He
gathered them into a large upper room and preached to
them the gospel. They entreated him
<pb id="steve208" n="208"/>
to remain and minister to them. He consented; attendants
on his ministry multiplied., and soon a church of fugitive
slaves was organized in the metropolis of New England.
The upper room became too strait for them, and, through
the zeal and energy of Mr. Grimes, a commodious and
handsome structure began to rise from its foundations.
Then came the fugitive slave act, pouring ruin on this
thriving exotic from the south. The church was arrested
midway toward its completion, and the members were
scattered in wild dismay. More than forty fled to Canada.
One of their number, Shadrach, was seized, but, more
fortunate than the hapless Sims, who had no fellowship
with them, he succeeded in making good his escape.
When the first fury of the storm had blown over, Mr.
Grimes set himself with redoubled energy to repair the
wastes that had been made. He collected money from the
charitable, and purchased the members of his church out
of slavery that they might return without fear to the fold.
He made friends among the rich, who advanced funds for
the completion of his church. At length it was finished,
and, as if for an omen of good, was dedicated on the first
day when Burns stood for trial before Mr. Commissioner
Loring.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref47" n="47" rend="sc" target="note47">1</ref><note id="note47" n="47" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref47">1 The church is a neat and commodious brick structure, two
stories in height, and handsomely finished in the interior. It will

land, was $13,000, of which, through the exertions of Mr.
Grimes, $10,000 have already been paid. The engraving is an

now devoting himself to the ransom of this
last victim of the oppressor, he but added one
more to the long list of acts that had given character
to his whole life.</p>
          <p>Finding the business on his hands, Mr. Grimes
proceeded to prompt and energetic action. His
first care was to have Mr. McDaniel informed that
his terms were accepted; and an appointment was
made to meet him with Anthony in Baltimore on
the twenty-seventh of February, and there complete
the negotiation. He then laid the subject before
the Baptist clergy of Boston at their weekly
meeting. Most of them entered warmly into his
plan and engaged to take up collections in their
several churches. The same course was pursued
toward the clergy of other denominations with
various degrees of success. From these sources,
about three hundred dollars were obtained. Three
of the old subscribers redeemed their pledges by
the payment of one hundred dollars each; and
smaller sums were obtained from other persons of
less means. When the day for his departure for
Baltimore arrived, Mr. Grimes had succeeded in
collecting only six hundred and seventy-six dollars.
At the last moment, it seemed likely that the plan
would fall through. The whole sum must be taken
to Baltimore, and Mr. Grimes had no means of
his own to make good the deficiency. The time
bad been fixed, McDaniel would be on the spot,
and finding no purchaser, would depart in a state
of irritation and sell Anthony to go south, as he
<pb id="steve210" n="210"/>
had already threatened in one of his letters. In this
emergency, the friendly cashier of a Boston bank stepped
in to Mr. Grimes's relief. He received the amount already
collected, accepted the note of Mr. Grimes for the
balance, and placed in his hands a cheque on a Baltimore
bank for thirteen hundred dollars. Thus furnished, Mr.
Grimes took his departure for the Monumental city. it had
been agreed that he should be accompanied by Mr.
Stockwell, but, through some misunderstanding, the
latter failed to appear at the place and time appointed. Mr.
Grimes proceeded alone, and at eleven o'clock on the
twenty-seventh of February arrived at Barnum's Hotel in
Baltimore.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, McDaniel had broken the subject to
Anthony. On receiving the first letter from Mr. Stockwell,
he asked the slave if he had been writing letters to the
North. Anthony evaded the question. McDaniel then
informed him of Mr. Stockwell's proposition to purchase
him, and inquired if he would like to have his freedom.
Burns hesitated to answer, fearing that he should be
entrapped. He asked permission to look at the letter,
which was readily granted. Finding that McDaniel had
truthfully represented the matter, he then frankly avowed
his desire to be free and go to the North. Nothing more
passed until the letter was received which announced the
acceptance of McDaniel's terms and fixed the day of
meeting in Baltimore. Soon after, Anthony drove his
master to the railroad station for the purpose of taking the
train to Richmond.</p>
          <pb id="steve211" n="211"/>
          <p>On alighting, Mr. McDaniel paced the ground to and fro,
absorbed in thought. At length he addressed Anthony:</p>
          <p>“I am going to tell you a secret; you must
communicate it to no one, not even to my wife; what do
you think it is?” continued he, after a pause.</p>
          <p>Anthony professed that he could not imagine, unless
it was that some news had come from the North.
McDaniel then informed him of the happy prospect
before him, and, directing him to be in readiness to depart
for Baltimore on the following Monday, once more
repeated his injunction of secrecy. It was at no small risk
to himself that he was about to set at defiance the public
sentiment of the South by sending Anthony back to the
North.</p>
          <p>Monday morning found master and slave on their
journey northward by rail. Before they had proceeded
ten miles, McDaniel's apprehensions were realized.
Through the carelessness or treachery of a friend whom
McDaniel had made a confidant, it became known that
the obnoxious fugitive was on board. The passengers
were quickly in a tumult, and it was proposed to stop the
train and put the “boy” out. The conductor protested
that had he known in the outset who Anthony was he
would not have permitted him to enter the cars at all. The
firmness of McDaniel, however, held the mob spirit in
check, and Anthony was at length suffered to proceed
without further molestation.</p>
          <p>On arriving at Norfolk, they immediately went on
board the steamer bound for Baltimore. Leaving
<pb id="steve212" n="212"/>
Burns in the vessel, McDaniel went back into the city
to transact some business. Meantime, the mischievous
passengers of the railroad train had circulated the news
of Anthony's presence. The waspish little city was at
once thrown into angry commotion and forthwith
swarmed in a body on board the vessel. There, on
returning soon after, McDaniel found his man Anthony
surrounded by the chivalry of Norfolk, and half dead
through fear of their threatened violence. Sending him
below deck, McDaniel faced the excited throng. They
demanded that he should forego his purpose, and offered
him fifteen hundred dollars for his slave. He declined the
offer. They then pressed him to name his own price. His
reply was that he had agreed to take Burns to Baltimore,
and he intended to keep his word if it cost him his life.
They then attempted to move him by intimidation, but
this only roused his spirit. For an hour and a half, with
pistol in hand, he kept them at bay. At last, he was
allowed to depart on giving assurance that if the
Massachusetts purchasers failed to keep their
appointment, he would immediately return and dispose of
Burns at Norfolk.</p>
          <p>Without further molestation they pursued their way
to Baltimore, and arrived at Barnum's Hotel about two
hours after Mr. Grimes. The latter was absent at the
moment, but, returning shortly after, was immediately
ushered into the private apartment where the two
travellers were secluded. Anthony greeted him with a
face all radiant with
<pb id="steve213" n="213"/>
happiness, and then, turning to his owner, exclaimed, “I
told you it must be Mr. Grimes.” In explanation of this,
McDaniel said that Burns had constantly maintained,
notwithstanding the correspondence had been
conducted by Mr. Stockwell, that Mr. Grimes would be
found at the bottom of the efforts for his liberation.</p>
          <p>Negotiations were at once commenced. Mr. Grimes
produced his cheque on the Baltimore bank, but
the cautious slave trader required the cash. Accordingly,
Mr. Grimes went to the bank to get the cheque cashed,
but found to his annoyance that, by a rule of the
institution, some citizen of Baltimore was required to
certify that he was the person named in the cheque. He
was unknown to a single individual in the city. From this
dilemma he was relieved by the kindly aid of the landlord,
Barnum. The cheque was indorsed to McDaniel, Barnum
made the necessary certification in his behalf, and the
cash was obtained. Before signing the bill of sale,
the thrifty slave trader required an additional sum of
twenty-five dollars to defray his expenses. Remonstrance
was unavailing, and it was paid. The transaction being
completed, Mr. Grimes pleaded with McDaniel to make
Anthony a present of a hundred dollars with which to
begin his new life; but the plea was met by the reply that
twice that amount had already been sacrificed in keeping
the engagement.</p>
          <p>By this time a rumor of Burns's presence had got into
circulation, and some feeling began to be displayed
<pb id="steve214" n="214"/>
among the people in the hotel. Mr. Grimes, in
consequence, decided at once to leave the city. As he
and Burns passed out of the hotel, they met, upon the
<sic corr="threshold">threshhold</sic>, Mr. Stockwell, who had that moment arrived.
Finding the business completed, he turned and
accompanied them back to the railway station. There
they encountered another of the thousand safeguards
erected by slavery, for its protection, at the expense of
perpetual vexation to freemen. This was a regulation of
the railroad company requiring a bond of one thousand
dollars to hold the company harmless for carrying
negroes. Through the friendly offices of Mr. Barnum,
who signed the instrument, this obstacle was
surmounted; the train then whirled off, the land of
bondage was forever left behind, and that night
Anthony Bums slept in Philadelphia, a free man upon
free soil.</p>
          <p>From this period he entered upon his career as a
citizen of the United States, equal in the eye of the law to
his former owners, and entitled to all the immunities and
privileges which they could claim. But, though invested
with this high title, it was practically of little or no avail
to him throughout one half of the Union. It was true that
the Constitution more unequivocally guarantied his
protection as a freeman than his restoration as a slave;
but all experience had shown it to be also true that this
guaranty was for him, and such as him, worth absolutely
nothing. With a solemn constitutional pledge that he
should be protected in the enjoyment
<pb id="steve215" n="215"/>
of all rights of citizenship while sojourning
anywhere within the domain of the Union, he yet could
not venture to set foot again upon the soil of his native
state. Henceforth the only home for him was in the
North.</p>
          <p>On the day following his manumission he proceeded
to New York, and, in a public assembly which was
gathered to welcome him, narrated his story. Early in
March he repaired to Boston, where preparations had
been made to give him a public reception and
congratulate him on the recovery of  his freedom.
A large meeting was held in Tremont Temple, and
there, surrounded by many clergymen, and others of
note, Burns stood forth upon the platform and repeated
his tale of outrage and suffering. His manly address,
the sobriety of his speech, and the degree of intelligence
which he manifested, took his audience by surprise and
won for him increased respect. “Burns is more of a man
than I had supposed,” said the Rev. Mr. Kirk in his
address on the occasion; “he has spoken to my heart
to-night like a man. He has the true oratorical ring in
him, like that of some of the Indian orators.”</p>
          <p>This meeting was followed by others of a like
character in various parts of the Commonwealth. The
people were eager to see the man whose enforced return
to slavery had so convulsed the State. Nor did they fail
to accompany the gratification of their curiosity with
substantial tokens of their sympathy. It was far from
Anthony's wish or intention,
<pb id="steve216" n="216"/>
however, to gain a livelihood by making merchandize
of his wrongs.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref48" n="48" rend="sc" target="note48">1</ref><note id="note48" n="48" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref48">1 Immediately after Burns recovered his freedom, the great
showman, Barnum, addressed a letter to one of his friends
offering him $500 if he would take his stand in the Museum at
New York, and repeat his story to visitors for five weeks. When
Burns was made to comprehend the nature of this proposal, he
rejected it with indignation. “He wants to show me like a
monkey!” said Burns.</note>
 The calling to which he had
devoted himself while a slave, he was more than ever
bent on pursuing now that he had become a freeman.
He still felt it to be his duty and desire to preach the
gospel. This decision received the approval of his
friends, and they took measures to promote his design.
To qualify him for the sacred office, it was necessary that
he should pass through a complete course of study. A
lady of Boston, who held a scholarship in the Institution
at Oberlin, offered to place him on that foundation. This
offer was gratefully accepted, and early in the summer of
1855, he entered upon his studies in that Institution.</p>
          <p>Soon after taking up his residence at Oberlin, he
addressed a note to his old pastor in Virginia, requesting
a letter of dismission and general recommendation from
the church of which he had been a member while in
bondage. To this request no direct answer was ever
returned. But it served, apparently, to remind pastor and
church of the great neglect of duty toward the
institution of slavery of which they had been guilty; and
they proceeded to repair that neglect by
excommunicating Burns, for “disobeying both the laws
of God
<pb id="steve217" n="217"/>
and man by absconding from the service of his master
and refusing to return voluntarily.” Four months after,
he received a copy of a newspaper containing a
communication signed by the pastor and addressed to
himself. It included the sentence of excommunication,
and a defence of slavery drawn from the New Testament
by the pastor, together with a rebuke of all <sic>christian</sic> anti-
slavery men. To this communication Burns published an
answer, which showed not only his ability to cope with
the Virginia pastor in argument, but also his progress in
a sound interpretation of the Bible.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref49" n="49" rend="sc" target="note49">1</ref><note id="note49" n="49" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref49">1 See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixk">Appendix K.</ref></note></p>
          <p>Thus by the hand of unchristian <sic>rudenesss</sic> was
severed the last tie that connected Anthony Burns with
the land of bondage.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XII.</head>
          <head>THE TRIAL OF THE COMMISSIONER.</head>
          <p>WHILE Burns was rehearsing the story of his great
wrong in the cities and villages of Massachusetts, the
Commissioner, by whose act he had suffered, was himself
put on trial at the bar of the People. The part which he
had played in the tragedy of June had drawn upon
himself the hostile attention of large masses of his
fellow-citizens, while the tragedy itself had precipitated
a political revolution of which he was destined to be a
conspicuous victim. A glance at the posture of affairs in
the Commonwealth, during the period immediately
preceding that event, will reveal more fully the causes of
that revolution.</p>
          <p>In the beginning of the year 1853, the <sic>whigs</sic> of
Massachusetts recovered the control of the government
which they had held for nearly a quarter of a century, but
of which, for the two years previous, they had been
deprived. Their new hold of power was, however, by no
means secure. Their opponents, powerful in numbers and
personal influence, regarded their success as an accident,
and confidently looked forward to a speedy reversal of
the popular decision. A Convention
<pb id="steve219" n="219"/>
for revising the Constitution had been ordered;
and, at the elections in the spring, the Opposition
secured a large majority of its members. The summer
saw the Convention in full operation, and the majority,
exulting in their strength, proceeded to make the most
radical changes in the Constitution. In the autumn,
they appealed to the people for a ratification of their
work. It was decisively refused. The blow was doubly
fatal, for it crushed not only the new Constitution, but
also the party which had devised it. Again the <sic>whigs</sic>
returned to power, and with vastly augmented strength.
A wise improvement of past experience was all which
they now needed to secure them firmly in their ancient
seats. They had lost power in the first instance by
crossing the anti-slavery sentiments of the people;
they were sure to retain and increase it by reforming
their policy on that subject. An opportunity to test their
disposition was almost immediately presented by the
proposal to repeal the Missouri Compromise. As the
party in power, as the party to whom had been entrusted
the privilege of uttering authoritatively the voice of
Massachusetts in such a crisis, it was their duty to have
led off in an instant, energetic, and indignant rebuke
of the premeditated wrong. But they hung back until
their defeated foes led the way, and then feebly followed
with cautiously-worded protests. That was not all. Of the
two Massachusetts members of the United States Senate,
Edward Everett and
<pb id="steve220" n="220"/>
Charles Sumner, the former was a representative of the
whig party, and the latter a representative of their
opponents. Most unfortunate for the whig party was the 
contrast presented by the conduct of the two in the strife
about the Missouri Compromise. While Mr. Sumner
extorted admiration, even from his opponents, as the
gallant and courageous champion of Massachusetts, the
whig Senator compelled his friends to hang their heads in
shame by tamely apologizing for having presented to the
Senate the noblest remonstrance ever made in behalf of
the imperilled cause of human freedom.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref50" n="50" rend="sc" target="note50">1</ref><note id="note50" n="50" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref50">1 Remonstrance of three thousand ministers of New England
against the repeal of the Missouri Compromise.</note> Having begun by
thus damaging the antislavery character of his party, he
finished by resigning his place at a moment when the
Legislature had put it out of their power, by a final
adjournment, to provide a permanent successor. The prize
of the vacant senatorship at once became a powerful
incentive to revolution. It stimulated alike the aspiring and
the patriotic among the Opposition to indefatigable efforts
to replace the retiring, not to say retreating, Senator with
one who would stand shoulder to shoulder with the
remaining Senator. Then followed that embattled assault
by the Federal Government in behalf of Virginia slavery,
upon the peace, and dignity, and cherished faith of
Massachusetts, the like of which had not been witnessed
within her borders since the Boston Massacre of 1770.
Again was a great
<pb id="steve221" n="221"/>
opportunity presented to the whig party. The insulted
Commonwealth demanded a demonstration against the
unpardonable outrage, and a fit demonstration could only
come from the party in power. They were the State; in their
keeping was its honor; they only could utter its voice with
authority. But they did nothing;—and again they did
nothing. Then, and from that hour, the whig party rushed
swiftly downward to its ruin. A movement in another
direction concurred to hasten the catastrophe. Some 
months before, a secret political association had been
organized in the State. Its growth had been small, and,
down to the period of Burns's arrest, it continued small.
But its organization was thorough, and its machinery the
most controlling and effective ever devised. It invited
recruits, and, to all political wanderers and malcontents,
held out the alluring prospect of a new home and new
means of power. And now, on the one hand, the
discomfited and scattered members of the Opposition, and
on the other, the discontented portion of the party in
power, together plunged headlong into the recesses of
this invisible party. All through the summer and early
autumn the exodus from the old parties went steadily on;
as the day of election approached, it went on with
accelerated velocity. At length, the thirteenth of
November revealed to the world the astounding result.
The whig party had vanished away. Of the sixty thousand
that had borne it into power the year before, but twenty-
seven thousand remained. In
<pb id="steve222" n="222"/>
its place had come up, eighty thousand strong, a party
which at the previous election had no existence. City and
country had alike yielded to their power. The great
metropolitan stronghold had been stormed, and the
remotest village, whether of Berkshire or Cape Cod, had
been penetrated and revolutionized. Everything was
theirs. Theirs was the Governor, for the first time in a
decade of years by the popular vote; theirs was the entire
Senate; theirs, with three or four exceptions, was the
multitudinous House of Representatives. The revolution
was complete and universal.</p>
          <p>The party thus puissantly inaugurated, now turned
their attention to the outrage which had so signally
contributed to their success. Representing the State by a
more indisputable title than any party which had ever
before been entrusted with power, they proceeded to
pronounce the judgment of the State upon that transaction.
Two methods of procedure were possible. They might
enact a general law, or they might deal with the particular
actors in the tragedy, if any were found to be properly
within their purview. Both methods were adopted,
but with the latter only is this history concerned.</p>
          <p>Of the obnoxious actors in the tragedy of Burns, no
one was within reach of the power of the State but the
Commissioner, Edward Greeley Loring. This person was
one of that class of men who never, except by accident,
appear on the page of history. A lawyer of moderate
abilities, he had
<pb id="steve223" n="223"/>
passed the middle period of life without having made any
figure at the bar, and was content to solicit from his
professional brethren that class of business technically
called office-practice. Unambitious and reserved, he had
never mingled with the people nor courted their favor in
the political arena; and, until his obnoxious conduct
elevated him into notice, he was probably unknown to the
greater part of his fellow-citizens. But he had powerful
friends, through whose influence, direct or indirect, his
fortunes were essentially advanced. Among them was
that family already mentioned in this history as
distinguished for its devotion to the fugitive slave law,
one of whose members then occupied a seat on the
bench of the Supreme Court of the United States.
Connected with this family by the ties of blood, Mr.
Loring was in a position, on the one hand, to claim the
benefit of their influence for himself, and on the other, to
be infected by their peculiar views on the subject of
fugitive slaves. But however this may be, he succeeded in
gaining places of public trust and emolument. In 1839, he
was appointed a Commissioner of the United States for
taking bail and affidavits, to which duty was added, by
the statute of 1850, that of sending back fugitives into
slavery. In 1847, he was appointed Judge of Probate
for the county of Suffolk. This  office he exercised
to the general satisfaction of the county. In 1854,
he was chosen by the Corporation of Harvard College,
a Lecturer in the Law School of that institution;
<pb id="steve224" n="224"/>
but, though he at once entered on the discharge
of his duties, the choice awaited the sanction of the
Overseers. All of these places he held at the time of the
rendition of Burns, and onward. With the office in which
he had offended, the state authorities had no power to
interfere, and in those over which they had control, he
bad done nothing amiss. Notwithstanding, it was
resolved to manifest their sense of his offensive conduct
in the former, by depriving him of the latter.</p>
          <p>The willing disposition of the Legislature to proceed
against Mr. Loring was sustained and stimulated by the
action of the people. Hardly had the two Houses been
organized, when from all quarters petitions for his
removal from the office of Judge of Probate began to
pour in. Every day witnessed fresh accessions to the
number, and in no long time it had swelled to more than
twelve thousand. On the other hand, but more tardily,
remonstrances against the removal were presented. The
whole number of these was less than fifteen hundred.
Between remonstrants and petitioners there was a
marked contrast. All of the former were men, and
generally were men belonging to the circle in which Mr.
Loring more immediately moved. But the petitioners were
from among the broad mass of the people; and many of
them were women, who, as being a class of persons
deeply interested in the character of Probate Judges,
very properly exercised their right of petition on this
occasion.</p>
          <pb id="steve225" n="225"/>
          <p>Roused by the signs of impending danger, Mr. Loring
at last himself presented to the Legislature a
remonstrance against his removal. This paper was
clumsily constructed and its argument was obscurely set
forth. Reduced to a logical form it seemed to be this: That
Mr. Loring ought not to be removed from the office of
Judge of Probate; first, because his action in the case of
Burns had been only that of a good citizen and a sworn
magistrate both of Massachusetts and of the United
States; second, because that action was not incompatible
with his duty as a Judge of Probate. The fugitive slave
law had found him holding the office of a Commissioner,
and had imposed upon him the additional duty of
sending back fugitive slaves. That law was an
amelioration of the old Jaw of 1793. It had been
pronounced by the Supreme Court of Massachusetts to
be constitutional; and he had been required by the
people of Massachusetts to swear as Judge of Probate to
support all constitutional laws. Thus, although he had
sent Anthony Burns back into slavery, he had done it
humanely, constitutionally, and in obedience to his oath.
Nor was the act inconsistent with the faithful discharge
of his Probate functions. The office of United States
Commissioner had been held by state magistrates, and,
therefore, might be held by a Judge of Probate. He had
received the appointment of a Probate Judge while
holding the office of Commissioner, and no objection had
been made from any authoritative quarter
<pb id="steve226" n="226"/>
against his continuing to discharge all its duties. Nor,
when by the act of 1850, the duty of returning fugitives
to slavery had been added to his other duties as
Commissioner, had he received any notice from the state
authorities that the two offices were thereby rendered
incompatible. Long custom, and expressive silence twice
repeated, thus sanctioned the position that a Judge of
Probate might properly act as a United States
Commissioner, and, so acting, might without blame send
back a fugitive into slavery.</p>
          <p>The conclusion of the remonstrance was in no suppliant
tone. “I claim as facts,” said the remonstrant, “that the
extradition of fugitives from service or labor is
within the provisions of the Constitution of the United
States; that the U. S. act of 1850 was and is the law of the
land; and, by the Supreme Judicial Court of this
commonwealth, obligatory on all its magistrates and
people; that action under the said act was lawful and not
prohibited by any State law to the judicial officers of the
State, and was in conformity with the official oath of all
officers of the State to support the Constitution of the
United States. And I respectfully submit to your
honorable bodies, that when your petitioners ask you to
punish a judicial officer for an act not prohibited by any
statute of Massachusetts, but lawful under those
statutes, and imposed by that law of the land which is the
law of Massachusetts, they ask of you an abuse of
power for
<pb id="steve227" n="227"/>
which the legislative history of Massachusetts furnishes
no precedent.”</p>
          <p>The petitions and remonstrances were referred to the
Joint Committee on Federal Relations, consisting of two
Senators and five Representatives. Before this Committee
had taken any action a heavy blow from another quarter
fell upon the Commissioner. It has already been stated
that his appointment as Lecturer in the Law School of
Harvard College awaited the sanction of the Board of
Overseers. This body was composed of the Governor, the
Lieutenant-Governor, the President of the Senate, the
Speaker of the House, the Secretary of the Board of
Education, the President and Treasurer of Harvard
College, and thirty other persons elected for a term of
years. Its meetings were usually held only during the
session of the Legislature. Whatever action had been
taken by the Corporation during the legislative recess
was then presented for confirmation. At the first meeting
this year, held on the twenty-sixth of January, the
President of the College laid before the Board Mr.
Loring's appointment. The Board took time to deliberate.
At the end of three weeks a second meeting was held,
when the question again came up. A ballot was taken,
and it was found that two thirds had voted against
confirming the appointment. Among those who thus put
the seal of their condemnation on the Commissioner, were
the Governor and Lieutenant-Governor of the
Commonwealth, and two
<pb id="steve228" n="228"/>
ex-Governors—a whig and a democrat—both of whom
had enjoyed in a rare degree the favor of their respective
parties.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref51" n="51" rend="sc" target="note51">1</ref><note id="note51" n="51" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref51">1 Governor Briggs and Governor Boutwell.</note> No debate was held, and no reasons were
assigned by the majority for their adverse action. There
was no need, for no one doubted that the Board had
taken this method to express their disapprobation of Mr.
Loring's conduct as Commissioner. By this stroke he
was deprived of an honorable office and a salary of
fifteen hundred dollars.</p>
          <p>Four days after, the Committee held their first meeting
to consider the question of his removal from the office of
Judge of Probate. The grave character of the proposed
step invested their proceedings with unwonted interest.
Only thrice since the adoption of the Constitution had a
Massachusetts Judge been removed from office by the
method of Address; never had one been removed for
such a cause. Ample powers had been granted to the
Committee. Witnesses were to be examined and
arguments to be heard; the proceedings assumed the
breadth and importance of a great public trial. To
accommodate the people, the committee-room was
abandoned, and the sessions were held in the Hall of the
Representatives. Long before the appointed hour, the
spacious apartment was filled to its utmost capacity;
crowds besieged the doors outside, and hundreds more,
unable to get within ear-shot, reluctantly went away. This
extraordinary exhibition of popular
<pb id="steve229" n="229"/>
interest was repeated at the second hearing, a week later,
and was not diminished when, on the sixth of March,
the final hearing was had.</p>
          <p>Testimony was taken respecting the Commissioner's
conduct, both in and out of the court-room, during
the trial of Burns. But the time was chiefly consumed
by arguments from various persons in favor of the
removal. Among these, the most distinguished were
Wendell Phillips, Theodore Parker, and the historian,
Richard Hildreth. They spoke for the twelve thousand
petitioners, and for the vast multitude beside, whom
those petitioners represented. Much of what was in the
public mind, much of what had appeared in the
public journals, was now brought to bear upon the
Committee with all the force which rare eloquence
and keen dialectic skill could exert.</p>
          <p>The reasons urged in favor of the removal were
various, but they were all reducible into two classes;
those which had respect to the character and conduct of
Mr. Loring, and those which had respect to the character
and conduct of Massachusetts. The Commissioner, it
was said, had not conducted the examination of Burns
fairly and uprightly. He had pushed it on with indecent
haste. He had manifested a purpose to send back the
prisoner without giving him a chance for defence. A
stickler for law, he yet had wrested the law to the
prejudice of the prisoner's rights. He had received the
admissions of the prisoner so far as they told
<pb id="steve230" n="230"/>
against him, and excluded them so far as they told in his
favor. He had suffered the worst part of the community
to be admitted into his court-room, and the better part to
be debarred therefrom. He had refused to secure for the
prisoner's counsel free access to his court. He had
prejudged the prisoner's cause. Before the examination
was fairly begun, he had on two different occasions more
than hinted that Burns would have to be sent back to
Virginia.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref52" n="52" rend="sc" target="note52">1</ref><note id="note52" n="52" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref52">1 See letters of Charles Grafton and Edward Avery to the
Committee on Federal Relations, printed in House Document,
No. 93.</note> He had also, in effect, prejudged the cause by
preparing a bill of sale of the prisoner. All these things
were so many disclosures of character; they showed Mr.
Loring's unfitness for the office of a Massachusetts
Judge. He ought, therefore, to be removed.</p>
          <p>But there was another view. Some, not stopping to
inquire whether as Commissioner he had acted well or ill,
held it to be the head and front of his offence that he
had acted at all. He should not have sat in judgment on
the case. He should not have issued his warrant. He
should have resigned his place as Commissioner if he
could not otherwise have honorably retained it.
Whatever might be his private views, as Judge of
Probate he was bound to keep himself free from the
contamination of slave-catching. Moreover, he had
violated the spirit of the Constitution, and especially of
the Bill of Rights. By that charter, Massachusetts
<pb id="steve231" n="231"/>
magistrates were required to “observe justice, piety, and
moderation;” to countenance the principles of humanity
and benevolence. But slave-catching was opposed to all
these. Nor was that all; he had violated an express statute
of the Commonwealth. By the law of 1843, all
Massachusetts officers and. magistrates were forbidden
to assist in the business of returning fugitive slaves, and
the terms of this law were held to include Judges of
Probate. Finally, whatever view might be taken of the
past, Mr. Loring had manifested a purpose to continue in
the business of a slave-catching Commissioner; he had
even insisted that it was a solemn duty which he could
not evade. If, therefore, he were longer suffered to retain
his judicial office, Massachusetts would proclaim to the
world that her Judges of Probate might properly, and
without offence, act a chief part in sending back into
perpetual slavery persons as much entitled to
compassion as widows and orphans.</p>
          <p>These reasons were of a punitive character; they had
respect mainly to Mr. Loring. But the removal was placed
upon higher and broader ground. It was necessary to
vindicate the character and to enforce the behest of the
Commonwealth. From the earliest days, Massachusetts
had taken up a position on the subject of slavery in
advance of every other nation in Christendom. During
the period of her colonial independence, she had
adopted the Mosaic code for her guide, and, while not
daring to prohibit what God had permitted,
<pb id="steve232" n="232"/>
had yet reduced slavery to its minimum of evil.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref53" n="53" rend="sc" target="note53">1</ref><note id="note53" n="53" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref53">1 A small volume has recently been presented to the
Massachusetts Historical Society, entitled, “Abstract of the Lawes
of New England as they are now Established,” and printed in
London in 1641. By the code there given, manstealing was
punished with death. In the same year the following statute was
enacted: “It is ordered by this Court and the authority thereof,
That there shall never be any bond slavery, villenege, or captivity
amongst us, unless it be lawful captives taken in just <sic>warrs</sic>, as
willingly sell themselves, or are sold to us, and such shall have the
liberties and Christian usage which the law of God established in
Israel concerning such persons, doth morally require, provided
this exempts none from servitude who shall be judged thereto by
authority.” [i. e. as a punishment for crime.] I have traced this
statute in the edition of the Laws of 1660, and in that of 1672.
There is no doubt that it continued in force till the abrogation of
the Charter in 1684. Among the “liberties and Christian usage”
secured by other enactments, were these: A servant flying from
the tyranny and cruelty of his master to the house of a freeman,
was to be protected and sustained there till due order was taken for
his relief. No servant was to be put off to another person for
above a year, neither in the lifetime of his master nor after his
death, by an executor, except by the authority of Court, or of two
Assistants. [An “Assistant” in those days exercised the functions
both of a Senator and of a member of the Governor's Council.] A
servant whose tooth was smitten out by his master, was to go free
from service and have such further recompense as the Court
should adjudge. (Mass. Laws, 1660.) There was also this important
statute in which the bondman is placed on an equality with the
freeman: “Every man, whether inhabitant or foreigner, free or
not free, shall have <sic>libertie</sic> to come into any publique court,
councel, or towne meeting, and either by speech or writing to
move any lawful, seasonable, or material question, or to present
any necessary motion, complaint, petition, bill, or information,
whereof that meeting hath proper cognizance, so it be done in
proper time, due order, and respective manner.”</note>During the subsequent period of her provincial vassalage under
royal governors, the power of the Crown was interposed
to arrest her tendencies toward the entire abolition of the
system, and
<pb id="steve233" n="233"/>
she was compelled to endure what she was unable to
remedy.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref54" n="54" rend="sc" target="note54">1</ref><note id="note54" n="54" rend="sc" anchored="yes" target="ref54">1 There is abundant evidence that the people of Massachusetts
were, during the provincial period, opposed to slavery, and would
fain have got rid of it, but were prevented by their governors. In
1701, only nine years after the colony was transformed into a
royal province, the representatives of Boston were requested by
that town to take measures to put a stop to negro slavery. The
preamble of an act passed in 1703, declares that “great charge
and inconveniences have arisen to divers towns and places by
the releasing and setting at liberty mulatto and negro slaves.”
In 1705, heavy duties were imposed by the General Court on
imported slaves, with a view to discourage the business. In 1712,
was passed “an act to prohibit the importation or bringing into
this Province [Massachusetts] any Indian servants or slaves;”
and one of the reasons assigned for the measure is, that such
importation “is a discouragement to the importation of white
Christian servants.” About the year 1716, Samuel Sewall, Chief
Justice of the Province, published a pamphlet in condemnation
of slavery. In 1767, an attempt was made to pass a law “to prevent
the unnatural and unwarrantable custom of enslaving mankind
and the importation of slaves into the province.” In 1769 one
James, a negro, brought a suit in the county of Suffolk, against
one Lechmere, to recover his freedom, and was successful. Other
suits were brought in other counties, and they were uniformly
decided in favor of the slaves. The ground of these decisions was
said to be, that all persons in the Province were by the charter as
free as the king's subjects in England, and there slavery was not
recognized by law. In 1774, a bill to prevent the importation of
slaves passed the two Houses, but Gov. Hutchinson refused to sign
it <hi rend="italics">because his instructions from the king forbade.</hi> Gov. Gage
refused his signature to a similar bill for the same reason.
In 1777, during the revolutionary war, a prize ship with a cargo of
slaves was brought into Salem, and the slaves were advertised to be
sold; but the Legislature then sitting in that town interposed,
prevented the sale, and ordered the slaves to be set at liberty. For
most of these facts, see a learned and instructive article on
slavery, in the 41st volume of the North American Review,
from the pen of the Hon. Emory Washburn, late Governor of the
Commonwealth.</note> But from the hour when she recovered
<pb id="steve234" n="234"/>
her ancient independence, slavery was forever banished
from her domain.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref55" n="55" rend="sc" target="note55">1</ref><note id="note55" n="55" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref55"><p>1 Slavery was abolished in Massachusetts by virtue of the clause
in her Constitution which declares that “all men are born free
and equal.” The great honor of having made that clause a part of
the Constitution belongs to JOHN LOWELL. This distinguished
man was born at Newburyport in 1743, and was graduated at
Harvard College in 1760. He commenced the practice of the law
in his native town, but in 1776 removed to Boston. He soon
after became a representative in the General Court, and also a
member of the Convention which framed the Constitution of the
State. In 1781 he was chosen a member of the Continental
Congress. In 1782 he was appointed Judge of the Admiralty Court
of Appeals. On the establishment of the Federal Government in
1789, he was appointed by Washington, District Judge of the
United States for Massachusetts. This office he held till 1801,
when, upon a reorganization of the courts, he was made Chief
Justice of the new Circuit Court for the eastern district. His death
took place in 1802. “He was,” says Cushing in his history of
Newburyport, “eminent for his judgment, integrity, and
eloquence as an advocate and legislator; for his impartiality,
acuteness, and decision as a judge; and for his zeal in the cause of
scientific and other useful institutions.</p><p>“Mr. Lowell was the bosom friend of the elder Adams, with 
whom he was associated on the sub-committee for drafting
the plan of the Constitution. Respecting his agency in procuring
the adoption of the clause which abolished slavery in
Massachusetts, I am happy in being able to present the testimony
of his son, now venerable for years and virtues, the Rev. Charles
Lowell, D. D., of Cambridge. In a recent note addressed to me,
he says: “My father introduced into the Bill of Rights the clause
by which slavery was abolished in Massachusetts. You will find,
by referring to the Proceedings of the Convention for framing
the Constitution of our State, and to Elliot's N. E. Biographical
Dictionary, that he was a member of the Convention and of the
Committee for drafting the plan, &amp;c., and that he suggested and
urged on the Committee the introduction of the clause, taken from
the Declaration of Independence a little varied, Which virtually
put an end to slavery here, as our courts decided, as the one from
which it war, taken ought to have put an end to slavery in the
United States. This he repeatedly and fully stated to his family
and friends. . . . . . In regard to the clause in the Bill of Rights,
my father advocated its adoption in the Convention, and, when
it was adopted, exclaimed: <hi rend="italics">‘Now there is no longer slavery in
Massachusetts; it is abolished, and I will render my services as
a lawyer gratis to any slave sueing for his freedom, if it is
withheld from him,’</hi> or words to that effect.” Mr. Lowell's view
of the effect which the clause would have, was speedily
confirmed by a decision of the Supreme Court. See <ref targOrder="U" target="appendixl">Appendix L.</ref></p></note>Becoming a member
<pb id="steve235" n="235"/>
of the Federal Union, she also became subject to
the fugitive slave law of 1793. But she never
ceased to detest it, and when, exactly half a century
after, a fit occasion was furnished by a decision
of the United States Supreme Court, she hastened
to place upon her statute-book an act expressive
of her detestation and of her ancient and unalterable
convictions. In this attitude the fugitive slave law
of 1850 met and confronted her. It soon became
manifest that as the new law was far more stringent
and oppressive than the old, so it was to be enforced
with far greater activity. Almost immediately after
its enactment, a negro was arrested, under its
provisions, within the borders of Massachusetts.
Fortunately for himself and for the peace of the
Commonwealth, he escaped from custody before
the law had taken its course. Soon, another was
arrested and sent back into bondage at the South,
there, as it turned out, to suffer imprisonment,
scourging, and death. In no long time after,
occurred the arrest and extradition of Anthony
Burns. It seemed that the soil of Massachusetts
was about to become a permanent hunting-ground
<pb id="steve236" n="236"/>
for Southern slave-catchers. What was she to do? She
could not follow the example of South Carolina; she could
not nullify a law of Congress; she could not arm her
citizens and bid them resist by force the execution of the
law. Nor did she need so to do; for she held in reserve a
great constitutional resource. By the terms of the Federal
Constitution, she had reserved to herself all the rights
and attributes of sovereignty not expressly granted to the
Federal Government. She had thus reserved to herself, as
an individual in the family of States, the right of private
judgment upon the constitutionality of federal laws. She
had reserved the right of influencing her citizens, within
the sphere of voluntary action, against assisting to
execute an obnoxious law. She had reserved the right to
say upon what conditions her citizens should enjoy the
honors and emoluments of offices within her own gift,
upon what conditions these should be forfeited. And if
she chose to make the voluntary aiding to execute the
fugitive slave law one of those conditions, such was her
sovereign right. Nor was it more a sovereign, a
constitutional, than it was a moral right. The citizen of
Massachusetts, though he owed allegiance to the United
States, owed a higher allegiance to his own State. For it
was she, and not the former, that chiefly provided for his
welfare. At her hand he obtained his elective franchise,
his schools, his roads, his police. He touched the State at
almost all points, the Federal Government at scarcely
<pb id="steve237" n="237"/>
more than one. If, therefore, a conflict of views arose
between the two, the State rightfully claimed that her
sentiments should be respected, rather than those of the
more distant, less protective Power.</p>
          <p>The conduct of Mr. Loring furnished an occasion for
the practical illustration of this doctrine. Massachusetts
had passed resolves expressive of her disapprobation of
the fugitive slave law. She had passed an act to
discountenance its execution within her territory. But
neither acts nor resolves had proved sufficient. An
example was needed to enforce the precept. The removal
of Mr. Loring would teach her citizens more impressively
than a whole statute-book of resolves, that, if they
desired to enjoy her favor, they must conform to her
views respecting the execution of the fugitive slave law.</p>
          <p>The Commissioner was formally notified to appear
before the Committee, if he chose, and make answer to
what might be said against him. In a brief note he
declined the privilege, and contented himself with
referring the Committee to his remonstrance as
containing all that he had to say. An unexpected
champion, however, volunteered to maintain his cause.
At the third and last hearing, Richard H. Dana, Jr.,
presented himself before the Committee, and asked to be
heard in behalf of the remonstrants. No man in the whole
Commonwealth occupied at that moment so commanding
a position for influencing the Committee, the Legislature,
and the public in favor of the Commissioner. As the
defender of Burns, he had won
<pb id="steve238" n="238"/>
the applause and gratitude of those who were now
pursuing the Commissioner. He had been in the best
position to witness the Commissioner's demeanor during
the examination. He was a most competent judge of his
official conduct, and was not likely to judge it more
favorably than facts would warrant. He had freely
condemned the Commissioner's decision; and he
protested that he now appeared before the Committee,
not for Mr. Loring's sake, but for the sake of the
principle involved.</p>
          <p>That principle was the independence of the Judiciary.
Its preservation, Mr. Dana argued, was a thing of the
highest moment to the welfare of the State and of every
citizen. But, if Judge Loring were to be removed by the
method proposed, and for the reason alleged, it would
receive a shock of the most serious character. True, the
Constitution gave to Government the power of removal
by Address; but it was a power exceedingly liable to
abuse, and this removal would be a most signal instance
of its abuse. For it was not pretended that Mr. Loring had
been guilty of any official misconduct; he was to be
deprived of an office in which it was admitted he had
borne himself well, because in another capacity he had
offended the popular will. If by such an example the
Judges of Massachusetts were taught to square their
conduct by the views of the party in power, their
independence would soon vanish away.</p>
          <p>To this argument the answer was short and conclusive.</p>
          <pb id="steve239" n="239"/>
          <p>The independence of the Judiciary can never be
threatened by a removal, it was said, unless the removal
is made on account of some judicial act. But it was not
proposed -to remove Judge Loring for any judicial act;
his removal, therefore, could not possibly influence the
judicial conduct of other judges. Their conduct in
another respect it would indeed powerfully influence; for,
with such a beacon in view, no Judge of Probate would
afterward venture to lend his aid in executing the fugitive
slave law. But this result was precisely what was aimed
at, and it was entirely consistent with the independence
of the Judiciary.</p>
          <p>Having concluded his argument on this point, Mr.
Dana assumed the character of a witness, and, moved
either by compassion or love of justice, delivered a
generous testimony in the Commissioner's behalf. His
conduct toward the prisoner Mr. Dana regarded as
considerate and humane. He had encouraged Burns to
resolve upon making a defence. He had postponed the
examination from Thursday to Saturday, and again from
Saturday to Monday, in order that counsel for the
defence might have time to make preparation. He had
commanded the Marshal, contrary to that officer's
inclinations, to admit Mr. Phillips and others to the
prisoner's cell for the purpose of arranging for a defence.
He had zealously <sic corr="cooperated">co-operated</sic> with others in the attempts
to purchase the prisoner's freedom; and had even gone
so far as to draw up an order, in view of the contemplated
purchase,
<pb id="steve240" n="240"/>
for his release from custody. These were facts which
Mr. Dana thought should have their just weight in
determining the culpability of the Commissioner.</p>
          <p>But all arguments and representations, even when
proceeding from such an influential source, failed of
producing their intended effect. On the twenty-second
of March, the Committee made their report. It was not a
model state paper, but its substance was weighty and
close to the point. It sharply dissected the
Commissioner's remonstrance, largely vindicated the
right of the Legislature to proceed by the sovereign
method of Address, and recapitulated, under four heads,
the objections against the Commissioner. It concluded
with recommending that an Address should be
presented to the Governor requesting him to remove Mr.
Loring from his judicial office. This report was signed by
four of the Committee. Of the remaining three members,
two presented a statement of reasons for not signing the
report of the majority, and the third presented a minority
report. Both agreed with the majority in their premises,
but dissented from their conclusion.</p>
          <p>The question of adopting the report came up in the
House on the twenty-seventh of March. But before any
action was taken, the reports were recommitted, at the
instance of Mr. Dana, for the purpose of hearing further
testimony on the question  whether the Commissioner
had prejudged the case of Burns. On the third of April, a
meeting
<pb id="steve241" n="241"/>
of the Committee was held and much testimony was
taken. Its effect was simply to strengthen the case
against the Commissioner. On the fourth, the Committee
reported back to the House the original report slightly
altered, and it was made the special assignment for
the tenth. During the forenoon and afternoon of that
and the two following days, it was warmly debated.
Various expedients were devised to avert the impending
blow, but none of them availed. On the fourteenth,
the House resolved, by a vote of two hundred and six
against one hundred and eleven, to send an Address to
the Governor.</p>
          <p>The action of the Senate was even more decisive. On
the twenty-seventh of the same month that body, after
mature deliberation, concurred with the House by a vote
of twenty-seven against eleven.</p>
          <p>Within a few days after, a Committee of both Houses
proceeded to the Council Chamber and presented the
Address to the Governor. It was in these words:</p>
          <p>“The two branches of the Legislature, in General
Court assembled, respectfully request that your
Excellency would be pleased, by and with the advice of
the Council, to remove Edward Greely Loring from the
office of Judge of Probate for the county of Suffolk.”</p>
          <p>The Governor of the Commonwealth at this time was
Henry Joseph Gardner. Like his predecessor in office,
John Hancock, of illustrious memory,
<pb id="steve242" n="242"/>
he was a Boston merchant; but there the parallel ended.
Mr. Gardner had never, like him, rendered any service
to the State which could possibly mark him out as a fit
person to be crowned with the honors of the chief
magistracy. Prior to his elevation, he had been placed by
his fellow-citizens of Boston in various situations
favorable for winning distinction—in municipal office, in
the Legislature, in the Constitutional Convention—but
in none of them had he risen above the level of
respectable mediocrity. In the Constitutional
Convention, which embraced the chief men of all parties
in the state, his position was among the followers and
not among the leaders; throughout its deliberations he
acted no conspicuous part, nor did he leave the impress
of his mind on any measure, whether of those that were
adopted or of those that were rejected. The dissolution
of that body left him in the position of a private citizen.
While thus situated, a sudden freak of fortune elevated
him to the chief place of honor in the Commonwealth.
Early in the autumn following the extradition of Burns, a
convention of the secret party already mentioned,
assembled in secret to nominate a candidate for
Governor. After a fierce contest among the partisans of
several candidates whose names had been made familiar
to the public, the choice of the convention, to the
surprise of every one, fell upon Mr. Gardner, whose
name had not even been mentioned. In the canvass
which followed, he displayed qualities as a political
tactician of which his previous career had
<pb id="steve243" n="243"/>
given no promise. He adopted a line of policy, the
audacity of which confounded his foes and excited the
admiration of his friends. His masterstroke was a
proclamation by letter of his abhorrence of the
fugitive slave law. To this public assurance, were added
private assurances of a still stronger character. Thus
pledged on the great grievance which Massachusetts
had to redress, Mr. Gardner was borne triumphantly into
power.</p>
          <p>The removal of Judge Loring became the first and chief
test of his fidelity to his pledges. Had opportunity been
presented for him to act on the case immediately after his
election, there was no reason to doubt that he would
have promptly made the removal. But in the interval of six
months which elapsed, a change came over the
complexion of public affairs that raised doubts about the
course he would take. Opinion was divided. Those who
desired the removal were confident that he would comply
with their wishes, for he had  privately informed some of
their number that he longed for an opportunity to do the
deed. Others, who drew their conclusions from different
premises, predicted that he would court the favor of
Virginia and risk that of Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>Speculation was speedily put to rest. On the tenth of
May, Governor Gardner transmitted a message to the
Legislature declining to comply with the prayer of their
Address.</p>
          <p>Thus ended the trial of the Commissioner. Through
the intervention of the Governor he was
<pb id="steve244" n="244"/>
suffered still to enjoy the emoluments of his office. But
no Governor could deprive the judgment of the
Legislature of its moral power. In the archives of the
State is laid up, for perpetual remembrance, a
record declaring it to be the will of Massachusetts that
under no plea of duty to the Federal Government shall
her Judges of Probate be suffered to compromise her
character by sending back fugitives into slavery.</p>
          <p>LIBERTY and LAW are both precious to the People of
Massachusetts. But Law is precious as the guardian of
Liberty and in nowise as her oppressor. When Law
turned against Liberty in the epoch of 1776, the People
rose and put down Law. But after Liberty had been
reinstated in her rightful supremacy, their next care was
to re-establish Law also. The lesson contained in this
History points to the same result. It represents Law in
the attitude of striking Liberty with the military arm, and
the People aroused and angered by the assault. Their
passion rose not then to the height of overwhelming
Law, but it rose to the height of warning against a
repetition of the tragic act. The remedy of 1776 will be
their reluctant last resort, but they are pledged by the
Declaration to its use when every other fails. And
meanwhile, they will be swift to punish, as the enemies
of both, those who array Law against Liberty. The Crest
of their escutcheon is not an unmeaning symbol.</p>

On the application of Charles F. Suttle, who this day
appeared in Court and made satisfactory proof to the Court
that Anthony Burns was held to service and labor by him, the said
Suttle, in the State of Virginia, and service and labor are due to
him, said Suttle, from the said Anthony, and that the said
Anthony has escaped from the State aforesaid, and that the
said service and labor are due him, the said Suttle, the master of
the said Anthony; and having further proved to the satisfaction
of the Court that the said Anthony is a man of dark
complexion, about six feet high, with a scar on one of his
cheeks, and also a scar on the back of his right hand, and about
twenty-three or four years of age,—it is therefore ordered, in
pursuance of an act of Congress, entitled ‘An Act to amend and
supplementary to the Act entitled “An Act respecting
fugitives from justice, and persons escaping from their
masters,”’ approved Feb. 12, 1793, that the matter so prayed

          <opener>
            <dateline>FRIDAY, June 2, 1854.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>MR. COMMISSIONER LORING came in at 9 o'clock,
and, the parties being all present, pronounced the following</p>
          <q type="decision" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="decision">
                  <head>DECISION.</head>
                  <p>The question submitted to my decision is, whether I shall
award to the claimant, Charles F. Suttle, a certificate,
authorizing him, to take and carry to Virginia the respondent,
Anthony Burns, whom he claims as owing him service and
labor. The kind of service which he sets up is that of a slave.</p>
                  <p>The respondent's counsel have objected to the
constitutionality of the act of 1850, under which these
proceedings are held, and to my right to act in the premises,
on several grounds.</p>
                  <p>[The Commissioner then stated the points of objection and
overruled them successively, and declared his opinion to be
that, upon the precedents, he was bound to hold the statute
constitutional in all the points affecting this case. We omit his
decision on these points, as being of less immediate interest.]</p>
                  <p>The facts to be proved by the claimant are three:</p>
                  <p>1. That Anthony Burns was his slave by the law of
Virginia.</p>
                  <pb id="steve255" n="255"/>
                  <p>2. That Anthony Burns escaped from slavery in Virginia.</p>
                  <p>3. That the prisoner is the Anthony Burns in question.</p>
                  <p>To prove the first point, the claimant introduces one
witness, Mr. William Brent, of Virginia. Mr. Brent's testimony
shows that Burns has stood in the relation of a slave to Col.
Suttle from his boyhood. It also shows that, at the time of the
alleged escape, Col. Suttle had leased Burns to one Millspaugh
of Richmond, and that Burns was then, and had for some time
been, in the custody and under the control of Millspaugh, and
that he escaped, if at all, from the custody and service of
Millspaugh. It is objected by the defendant's counsel, that this
evidence shows that Col. Suttle is not entitled to the
certificate. This raises, certainly, a serious question. By the law
of Virginia, slaves are chattels, and the lessee of the chattel,
being in possession, has the sole and exclusive right, against
the general owner himself, to the possession and control of the
chattel during the lease. The constitutionality of this statute is
sustained on the ground that the decision in these proceedings
affects merely the possession and temporary control of the
party claimed, and does not affect the general property or title.
If it were otherwise, it would constitute a suit at law, and a trial
by jury would be necessary. It would seem, therefore, quite
clear that upon the claimant's own theory, Mr. Millspaugh, and
not he, is the person entitled to claim this certificate. If Mr.
Millspaugh and Col. Suttle were to interplead before me, each
claiming the certificate, I cannot doubt that I should be obliged
to grant it to the former.</p>
                  <p>To prove the second point, viz.; the escape, the claimant
also offers the evidence of Mr. Brent. Mr. Brent
<pb id="steve256" n="256"/>
says only that Burns was in Richmond up to the 24th day of
March, and was then and ever since “missing.” He does not
say that he went away without the leave of Mr. Millspaugh,
who alone had the right to control his movements, and how or
why he was missing. To explain the act of Burns, they offer
evidence of his conversation with Col. Suttle, on the night of
his arrest. In this conversation he says that he did not escape;
but that, being on board a vessel at work, he was tired and fell
asleep, and was brought off by accident. Now this story may
not be true, but it is put in by the claimant, and it is the very
evidence tending to explain the act of Burns, and the claimant is
bound by it. Therefore, the claimant's evidence not only fails
to show an escape, but shows affirmatively that there was no
escape. To entitle the claimant to his certificate, there must be,
both by the Constitution and the statute, an escape. It is of no
consequence how or why the slave came into a free state,—
whether by accident or mistake, or by a superior power; unless
he escaped by his own voluntary act, against the will of his
master, the casus faederis does not arise. (Sims' case, 7 Cush.
298.)</p>
                  <p>On the oral evidence, then, the claimant must fail on the
second requirement of the statute, even if the point as to the
lease were not sustained.</p>
                  <p>But the claimant puts into the case a transcript of a record
made out <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi></foreign>, in Virginia, in pursuance of the 10th section
of the act of 1850. This act declares that this record “shall be
held and taken to be full and conclusive evidence of the fact of
escape, and that the service or labor of the person escaping is
due to the party in such record mentioned.” The record sets
forth that Anthony Burns does owe service and labor to
Col. Suttle by a law
<pb id="steve257" n="257"/>
of Virginia, and that he escaped from such service and labor in
Virginia. If, then, this record is to be received, and to have its
full statutory effect, the title and escape are established, and the
only question open to me is that of identity. But I should be
slow to believe that any statute of this land was intended to
make an <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi></foreign> record conclusive against the proof actually
made by the party who offers it, on a trial in presence of both
parties.</p>
                  <p>Here is a trial, with witnesses on the stand, in presence of
both parties, and the claimant's own proof shows him not
entitled to prevail. Can it be that be may fall back upon proof
offered at an <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ex-parte</hi></foreign> hearing, previously and elsewhere, and
contradict and control his own proof here, and compel the
Court to decide against the evidence? The defendant's counsel
contend that by offering proof of the title and escape, other
than the record, the claimant proceeds under the 6th section,
and not the 10th, and is not entitled to use the record, the two
sections providing for separate and distinct proceedings; also
that the conclusiveness of the record cannot apply to the
claimant's own proof, but only prohibits the defendant from
controverting the record by proof. They also object to the
instrument on the ground that it is not a record, but only a
recital that there is a record which is not produced, and because
it does not describe the party with “convenient certainty,” as
required by the statute, inasmuch as it does not say whether he
is a white, a negro, an Indian, or a mulatto, but only that he is
“dark-complexioned.” If on anyone of these grounds of objection
the record is not received, or not allowed to have conclusive
effect, the claimant must fail, because no escape has been
proved, to say nothing of the objection as to the lease.</p>
                  <pb id="steve258" n="258"/>
                  <p>Without deciding, at present, whether the record is to be
received or not, I will pass to the question of identity.</p>
                  <p>The testimony of the claimant is from a single witness, and
he standing in circumstances which would necessarily bias the
fairest mind—but other imputation than this has not been
offered against him, and from anything that has appeared
before me cannot be. His means of knowledge are personal,
direct, and qualify him to testify confidently, and he has done
so.</p>
                  <p>The testimony on the part of the respondent is from many
witnesses whose integrity is admitted, and to whom no
imputation of bias can be attached by the evidence in the case,
and whose means of knowledge are personal and direct, but, in
my opinion, less full and complete than that of Mr. Brent.
Then, between the testimony of the claimant and respondent,
there is a conflict, complete and irreconcilable. The question of
identity on such a conflict of testimony is not unprecedented
nor uncommon in judicial proceedings, and the trial of Dr.
Webster furnishes a memorable instance of it.</p>
                  <p>The question now is, whether there is other evidence in this
case which will determine this conflict. In every case of
disputed identity, there is one person always whose
knowledge is perfect and positive, and whose evidence is not
within the reach of error, and that is the person whose identity
is questioned, and such evidence is offered in this case. The
evidence is of the conversation which took place between
Burns and the claimant on the night of the arrest.</p>
                  <p>It may be conceded that this evidence, if received and
allowed its full weight, would establish the identity of the
prisoner with the Anthony Burns named in the record, beyond
a reasonable doubt. The conversation took place
<pb id="steve259" n="259"/>
very shortly after the arrest of Burns, at the time he first
discovered that he was claimed as a slave, and while he was in
custody. The only person examined as to his state of mind, a
witness for the claimant, says that at first Burns appeared
intimidated, but latterly had been entirely composed. Of course
this state of intimidation applies to the time of the
conversation, which was at the first moment he knew he was
held as a slave; and I remember that the next morning I thought
him in such a state as to require me to allow him an
adjournment, in order to make up his mind what course he
would pursue. It is said that the language of Col. Suttle to him,
‘I make you no promises and no threats—I make no
compromises with you,’ may be considered  as intimidating in
its character, or at least as intimating to the Prisoner that his
treatment hereafter would be according to his conduct there; and
I am requested to rule out this evidence, on the ground that the
admissions of an alleged slave to his master, while in custody
during a trial for his freedom, are not legal evidence for the
claimant, and on the further ground that, if not objectionable on
general rules, there is evidence here of actual duress and
influence. Another objection is, that the conversation put in by
the claimant is entire, and that if any part of it is received, the
whole must be received. His conversation, taken at the worst
for the respondent, asserts that he is the party named in the
record, and was the slave of the claimant, but shows that he did
not escape. It is an inflexible rule of law, founded in justice, that
the whole of an admission must be taken together. If, therefore,
I am to receive this conversation, while it would satisfy me of
the identity, it would negative the escape. But .the claimant
says the record is conclusive on the point of escape. If so, I
must reject a portion of this conversation,
<pb id="steve260" n="260"/>
because it conflicts with the record, and if I reject part on
such grounds, by the claimant's act, must I not reject the whole?
If so, the identity is not proved. The claimant's case is in this
dilemma. If the record is received and is conclusive, it seems to
me that I must reject the entire conversation, because I cannot
take the part that convicts him if I must reject the part that
acquits him, and the claimant fails because the identity is left in
doubt. If the record is rejected, the entire conversation goes in,
the identity is proved, but the escape is negatived. Therefore,
whether the record is received or rejected, the claimant must
fail.</p>
                  <p>Let me restate the conclusions to which I am led, on the
several points. I think myself bound by the precedents to hold
the statute constitutional, and to hold that I have jurisdiction in
the premises. It is the inclination of my belief that this record,
if otherwise sufficient, cannot be admissible as conclusive on
the Court against the positive proof of the claimant himself,
and that, without the aid of the conclusiveness of the record,
the claimant has not proved an escape, or a right of possession
in himself. On the point of identity, even if the title and escape
were proved, there is a reasonable doubt on the evidence of the
witnesses, and the burden of proof is on the claimant to
establish the identity beyond all reasonable doubt. If the
admissions of Burns were received and allowed full weight, it
would remove this reasonable doubt. To say nothing of the
objections to the competency of these admissions on general
principles, or under the circumstances of this case, I am not
willing to receive that part of a conversation which convicts a
man, if I am obliged, by the act of the other party, to reject that
part which acquits him. If, therefore, the record is received, the
entire conversation
<pb id="steve261" n="261"/>
goes out, and the identity is not proved. If the record
is rejected, the entire conversation goes in and the identity
is proved, but the title and escape are not proved. On
any of these grounds I am prepared to place my decision.
This result may be owing to the accidents and mistakes
which sometimes attend legal testimony, and arise in the
vicissitudes and complications of novel proceedings at law. But
I am bound to know only the evidence legally before me. The
certificate is refused and the prisoner must be 
discharged.</p>

            <p>SIR,—From the indications of an armed resistance to the
laws, and the assurances of the military officers on duty, it is
manifest that the force now under the orders of Maj. Gen.
Edmands is not sufficient to preserve the peace of the city. The
Marshal has at his disposal, by order of the President of the
United States, all the U. S. troops, as an armed <foreign lang="lat">posse
comitatus,</foreign> which can at present be drawn to this point. He
does not ask any aid to execute the <hi rend="italics">fugitive law</hi> as such.
Nothing is required but the preservation of the peace of the
city, and the suppression of organized rebellion.</p>
            <p>To effect this, we respectfully submit an opinion, that, if
bloodshed is to be prevented in the public streets, there must
be such a demonstration of a military force as will overawe
attack, and avoid an inevitable conflict between the armed
posse of the Marshal and the rioters; and earnestly request
you, under the views which Maj. Gen. Edmands has
communicated, or will communicate, to you, if desired, that
you will exercise the powers the law has confided to you, to
place under his command such a body of the Volunteer Militia
as will ensure the peace of the city without a conflict.</p>
            <pb id="steve270" n="270"/>
            <p>From the opinion of the military gentlemen with whom
we have conferred, and the indications from all other
sources of information within our reach, we beg leave to
express the opinion that the entire command of General
Edmands within the city will be requisite. We have no
express authority to pledge the General Government to
that effect, but we believe that the expenses incurred by
the necessity of such a military force will be met by the
President.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>SIR,—In reply to your note of this morning, we are
authorized by the President of the United States to state that
any expense incurred for the city military or otherwise,
deemed necessary by the U. S. Attorney and U. S. Marshal to
enforce the laws, will be paid by the United States.</p>
            <p>We deem it necessary that, when the decision of the
Commissioner is to be given, which will probably be to-morrow
morning, the avenues and streets around the Court House
should be cleared of the crowd, and an ample military force be
on guard to preserve the peace of the city, and prevent riot or
personal outrages, which are then to be anticipated, whatever
may be the decision.</p>
            <p>And we further deem it necessary that, if the Marshal with
his posse is required to pass through the streets of the city,
they should not be crowded upon, molested, or placed in a
position of defence which may render it necessary to protect
themselves by a resort to arms. And this
<pb id="steve271" n="271"/>
requires the whole military and police force of the city to
preserve the peace of the city, and prevent riot and assaults
upon the officers of the law in the discharge of their duty.</p>
            <p>We repeat what we have before said, that the United States
officers do not desire you to execute the process under the
<hi rend="italics">fugitive law</hi> of the United States, which devolves on them alone
in the discharge of their duties, but they call upon you, as the
conservator of the peace of the city, to prevent the necessity of
conflict between the posse of the Marshal and those who may
attempt to resist them by force while in the lawful discharge of
the duties required of them, whatever those duties may be.
Herewith is a copy of the authority derived from the President
of the United States.</p>

          <p>II. The line of march and the avenues leading thereto to be
cleared of citizens, and the military and police guards of the
city posted, before the escort moves.</p>
          <p>III. The police guards to be posted across the side streets at
those intersections of the avenues leading thereto which are
nearest State street, and the military guards between the several
police parties and State street.</p>
          <p>IV. One company of Cavalry to be posted immediately
below the old State House to support the clearing of streets if
necessary; then to move from square to square as the escort
moves down, preserving the same interval in advance of the
escort. A patrol to be kept in front, observing the several cross
streets, and, on their reports, detachments to be rapidly
advanced to any point of danger.</p>
          <p>V. The escort to move in the following order, viz.:
<list type="simple"><item>1st. Major Ridgely's Artillery Battalion, in posts.</item><item>2d. One platoon Marines.</item><item>3d. The Marshal's civil posse guarding the fugitive.</item><item>4th.

escort and form a guard to the field-piece.</item></list></p>
          <pb id="steve276" n="276"/>
          <p>VI. A company of Cavalry to be drawn up across Court
street and move toward the old State House as soon as the
escort shall have passed that building, and take its position as
a reserve to the whole force, first at State House and next in
rear of the infantry moving down State street—ready to act as
emergencies may require.</p>
          <p>VII. The military and police detachments to move from the
side avenues into State street as soon as the escort shall have
passed the second side street below them, respectively, and
gradually move down State street, so as to be within
supporting distance should the escort be attacked. These
detachments will march by a  flank on the sidewalks so as to
leave the street open to the advance of the Cavalry, when
necessary.</p>

          <p>“In answer to my request by mail, under date July 13,
1855, for a letter of dismission in fellowship and of
recommendation to another church, I have received a copy of
the Front Royal Gazette, dated Nov. 8, 1855, in which I find a
communication addressed to myself and signed by John Clark,
as pastor of your body, covering your official action upon my
request, as follows:</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>

<salute><hi rend="italics">“To all whom it may concern:</hi></salute></opener>
                  <p>WHEREAS, Anthony Burns, a member of this church, has
made application to us, by a letter to our pastor, for a letter of
dismission, in fellowship, in order that he may unite with
another church of the same faith and order; and whereas, it has
been satisfactorily established before us, that the said Anthony
Burns absconded from the service of his master, and refused to
return voluntarily—thereby disobeying both the laws of God and
man; although he subsequently obtained his freedom by
purchase, yet we have now to consider him only as, a <hi rend="italics">fugitive
from labor</hi> (as he was before his arrest and restoration to his
master), have therefore</p>
                  <pb id="steve281" n="281"/>
                  <p><hi rend="italics">“Resolved,</hi> Unanimously, that he be excommunicated from
the communion and fellowship of this church.</p>
                  <p>“Done by order of the church, in regular church meeting,
this twentieth day of October, 1855.</p>

              </body>
            </text>
          </q>
          <p>Thus you have excommunicated me, on the charge of
“disobeying both the laws of God and men,” “in absconding
from the service of my master, and refusing to return
voluntarily.”</p>
          <p>I admit that I left my master (so called), and refused to
return; but I deny that in this I disobeyed either the law of
God, or any real <hi rend="italics">law</hi> of men.</p>
          <p>Look at my case. I was stolen and made a slave as soon as I
was born. No man had any right to steal me. That manstealer
who stole me trampled on my dearest rights. He committed an
outrage on the law of God; therefore his manstealing gave him
no right, in me, and laid me under no obligation to be his slave.
God made me a <hi rend="italics">man</hi>—not a <hi rend="italics">slave;</hi> and gave me the same right to
myself that he gave the man who stole me to himself. The great
wrongs he has done me, in stealing me and making me a slave,
in compelling me to work for him many years without wages,
and in holding me as merchandize,—these wrongs could never
put me under obligation to stay with him, or to return
voluntarily, when once escaped.</p>
          <p>You charge me that, in escaping, I disobeyed God's law. No,
indeed! That law which God wrote on the table of my heart,
inspiring the love of freedom, and impelling me to seek it at
every hazard, I obeyed; and, by the good hand of my God
upon me, I walked out of the house of bondage.</p>
          <p>I disobeyed no law of God revealed in the Bible. I
<pb id="steve282" n="282"/>
read in Paul (1 Cor. 7: 21), “But, if thou mayest be made free,
use it rather.” I read in Moses (Deut. 23: 15, 16), “ Thou shalt
not deliver unto his master the servant which is escaped from
his master unto thee. He shall dwell with thee, even among you
in that place which he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it
liketh him best; thou shalt not oppress him.” This implies my
right to flee if I feel myself oppressed, and debars any man
from delivering me again to my professed master.</p>
          <p>I said I was stolen. God's Word declares, “He that stealeth a
man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall
surely be put to death.” (Ex. 21: 16.) Why did you not execute
God's law on the man who stole me from my mother's arms?
How is it that you trample down God's law against the
<hi rend="italics">oppressor,</hi> and wrest it to condemn me, the <hi rend="italics">innocent</hi> and
<hi rend="italics">oppressed?</hi> Have you forgotten that the New Testament
classes “manstealers” with “murderers of fathers” and
“murderers of mothers,” with “manslayers and whoremongers?”
(1 Tim. 1: 9, 10.)</p>
          <p rend="italics">The advice you volunteered to send me, along with this
sentence of excommunication, exhorts me, when I shall come to
preach like Paul, to send every runaway home to his master, as
he did Onesimus to Philemon. Yes, indeed I would, <hi rend="italics">if you
would let me.</hi> I should love to send them back <hi rend="italics">as he did,</hi> “NOT
NOW AS A SERVANT, but <hi rend="italics">above a servant;</hi>—A BROTHER—a
brother beloved—both <hi rend="italics">in the flesh</hi> and in the Lord;” both a
brother-man and a brother-Christian. Such a relation would be
delightful—to be put on a level, in position, with Paul himself.
“If thou count me, therefore, a <hi rend="italics">partner,</hi> receive him <hi rend="italics">as myself.</hi>” I
would to God that every fugitive had the privilege of returning
to such a condition—to the embrace of <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a <hi rend="italics">Christianity</hi>—“not
now as a servant, but above a servant,”—
<pb id="steve283" n="283"/>
a “partner,”—even as Paul himself was to Philemon! </p>
          <p>You charge me with disobeying the <hi rend="italics">laws of men.</hi> I utterly
deny that those things which outrage all right are
laws. To be real laws, they must be founded in equity.</p>
          <p>You have thrust me out of your church fellowship. So be it.
You can do no more. You cannot exclude me
from heaven; you cannot hinder my daily fellowship with
God.</p>
          <p>You have used your liberty of speech freely in exhorting and
rebuking me. You are aware that I too am now where I may
think for myself, and can use great freedom of speech, too,
if I please. I shall therefore be only returning the favor of your
exhortation if I exhort you to study carefully the golden rule,
which reads, “All things whatsoever ye would that men should
do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the
prophets.” Would you like to be <hi rend="italics">stolen,</hi> and then <hi rend="italics">sold?</hi> And
then worked without wages? and forbidden to read the Bible?
and be torn from your wife and children? and then, if
you were able to make yourself free, and should, as Paul said,
<hi rend="italics">“use it rather,”</hi> would you think it quite right to be
cast out of the church for this? If it were done, so wickedly,
would you be afraid God would indorse it? Suppose you were
to put your soul in my soul's stead; how would you read the
law of love?<ref targOrder="U" id="ref57" n="57" rend="sc" target="note57">1</ref><note id="note57" n="57" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref57">1 In reply to a note which I addressed to Anthony, respecting this letter, he

          <head>THE BARRE SLAVE CASE.—THE FIRST TRIED UNDER<lb/>
THE CONSTITUTION OF 1780.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>[The following account of the first slave case in Massachusetts
after the adoption of the State Constitution, was written by the
Rev. George Allen, of Worcester, and is taken from the appendix
to a discourse preached by the Rev. James Thompson, D. D., of
Barre, at the end of his ministry of fifty years in that town.]</p>
          </argument>
          <p>This was the case of a negro man named Walker, belonging
to this town (Barre). Quock, as Walker was commonly called,—
for slaves, having in law no fathers, and their mothers no
husbands, have themselves no surnames, but are called like
horses and dogs, as the whims of their masters and a degrading
system may dictate,—had been a slave of Nathaniel Jennison,
a substantial farmer of Barre, who still claimed him as a slave.
The constitution was ratified in the spring of 1780, and it was
now summer, when a long day's freedom was worth something
more than a short day's bondage in winter. Haying was at hand,
and Quock was a rare hand at haying About this time, William
Caldwell, senior,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref58" n="58" rend="sc" target="note58">1</ref><note id="note58" n="58" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref58">1 See Note at the end.</note> a neighbor of Jennison and of Quock, too,
told the latter that he was a free man, and offered him wages
if he would bear the heat and burden of the day on his farm,
a proposal made still more inviting by the promise of Caldwell
that he would stand between him and harm if Jennison should
<pb id="steve285" n="285"/>
punish him for being free. Quock loved both liberty and the
reward of his own hard toil, though he had never tasted of
either; and being in other respects a man, though an African,
pondered the matter, and resolved to be a freeman in Caldwell's
employ rather than be a slave in Jennison's for nothing.
Accordingly, on a summer's morning, having had orders the
night before from Jennison to be up betimes and mow in his
field, Quock was up by daybreak and soon found his way to
Caldwell's meadow, with a scythe as busy and as sure as
Time's. After a while, Jennison went to his field to see that all
was well; but Quock was not there, nor any trace of his
handiwork. Not a swarth was laid, not a flower of the field
fallen. Jennison, who was a man of sense, quickly cast about
him, and suspected the whereabouts of the fugitive. He at once
hied over to Caldwell's farm, where, at a distance, he soon spied
Quock, as busy in Caldwell's meadow as he had ever been in his
own. He suddenly stopped on the brow of a hill and halloed to
the new-made freeman <hi rend="italics">to go home.</hi> But Quock was so attentive
to his work, or so engrossed in contemplating the sweets of
liberty, that he seemed to hear nothing from a distance.
Jennison hurried down the hill, and, having come within sure
hailing distance, tried the persuasion of <hi rend="italics">hard threats;</hi> but all
in vain, for Quock, encouraged by Caldwell's presence, and
not forgetting the promise of a strong and resolute man to stand
between him and harm, answered never a word, but kept on
mowing as though nothing bad happened. Jennison, baffled in
his experiment, and well knowing where he was and with whom
he had to do, went back more vexed than he came, resolved to
bide his time, which, after lingering, at last came, though not
altogether in the very shape he looked for. * * * * </p>
          <pb id="steve286" n="286"/>
          <p>How soon Jennison re-assumed his authority over Quock
as his slave, I cannot say; but the first experiment I know
of was <hi rend="italics">that which gave rise to the trial in the Supreme
Court whose issue settled forever the question of slavery in
Massachusetts;</hi> and it is remarkable that so few particulars
are recorded of a case which excited, at the time of
the occurrence, so much interest, and was followed by
consequences so marked and lasting. Seventy years have
elapsed since the issue was tried, and freedom triumphed.
The men who witnessed it are gone; and the voices of
tradition have become few and indistinct. The personal
narrative already given is related on hearsay, not very
recent. What follows I take from a copy of the record
of court obtained several years ago, and now before me
in the crabbed and uncouth dialect of ancient legal
barbarity.</p>
          <p>By the record it appears that “on the first day of May,
A. D. 1781, the said Nathaniel, with his fist, and a large stick,
which the said Nathaniel held in his hand, the said Quock did
beat, bruise, and evilly intreat, and him, the said Quock, with
force and arms, did imprison during the space of two hours.”
The indictment was found at the September term of the
Supreme Court, 1781 ; but the trial did not take place till the
April term, 1783, at which time Jennison was found guilty and
sentenced to pay a fine of forty shillings, with the costs of
prosecution, and ordered to stand committed till sentence be
performed. The record states that Jennison pleaded <hi rend="italics">not guilty,</hi>
but does not indicate the ground of his defence, nor any
opinion of the court from which it might be inferred. Both,
however, are briefly stated by Dr. Belknap, in his
correspondence with Judge Tucker of Virginia, in 1796, in
which he says, “His (Jennison's) defence was, that the black
was his
<pb id="steve287" n="287"/>
slave, and that the beating, &amp;c., was the necessary restraint and
correction of the master. This was answered by citing the
clause in the declaration of rights, ‘all men are born free and
equal.’ The judges and jury were of opinion that he had no right
to beat or imprison the negro.” (Collections of Mass. Hist.
Society, vol. IV.)</p>
          <p>The issue of the prosecution of Jennison was virtually the
decision of the highest tribunal in the State, that slavery had no
legal existence in Massachusetts; and its immediate effect was
to set free all who were held in bondage within her jurisdiction.
It carried out, in its true idea, the unanimous resolve of the
convention that formed the constitution, “that the government
of Massachusetts shall be a FREE REPUBLIC.” It was the first
decision on this continent, if not the first in the world, which
gave freedom to the collective slaves of a sovereign State, where
a like servitude had been expressly or tacitly allowed. Several
cases, however, had occurred in other parts of Massachusetts,
of slaves sueing their masters in the inferior Courts for freedom
and wages; and “the juries invariably gave, their verdict in favor
of liberty;” but the legal effect of such verdicts reached none but
the parties immediately concerned.  * * * *  I have searched, both
here and in Boston, where the early records of the Supreme
Court were exclusively kept, for the list of the grand jury which
formed the indictment, but without success. The names of the
jury which tried the <hi rend="italics">Barre Slave Case,</hi> if I may now venture to
call it such, were, foreman, Jonas How, and fellows, William
McFarland, Isaac Choate, Joseph Bigelow, John White, Daniel
Ballard, Ebenezer Lovell, Phillips Goodridge, John Lyon,
Jonathan Woodbury, Thomas White, and John Town.</p>
          <note id="note59" n="59" place="foot" anchored="no">
            <p>NOTE,—It was not William, but John Caldwell. I have this fact
<pb id="steve288" n="288"/>
from his grandson, Seth Caldwell, Esq., of Barre, who had
frequently heard both his father and his grandfather relate all the
circumstances. From the same source I have derived some
additional particulars of interest which I will here set down.</p>
            <p>John Caldwell was a man of property and influence, and the
leading magistrate in the town. Before the Revolution, he had
represented Barre in the General Court. In advising Quock of his
rights as a freeman, he did no worse for his neighbor Jennison
than he had done for himself; for he had already emancipated his
own slave, Mercy, and not only so, but had also made provision
for her comfort. Another neighbor, John Black, had emancipated
his slave Dick, Mercy's husband, at the same time. Caldwell and
Black then built a small house and presented to the pair, and they
dwelt in it for many years afterwards, earning their own support.
Not long after Quock left Jennison, the latter went over to
Caldwell's farm with several men, for the purpose of removing his
slave (as he still called him) by force; but Quock, backed by
Caldwell, presented so bold a front, being determined to resist,
even unto blood, that Jennison thought it prudent to retire,
without even attempting a seizure. Quock continued with Caldwell
until his freedom was legally decreed, Caldwell acting as his chief
friend and adviser in carrying the case through court. He afterward
married, became the possessor of a little homestead in Barre, and
there continued to reside until his death, which occurred about
forty years since.</p>
            <p>Quock had a younger brother, named Prince Walker, who was
also the slave of Jennison. When about seven years old, he was
sold to a man in East Windsor, Ct. Prince kept the reckoning of
his age until he was twenty-one, and then escaped from his master
and returned to Barre. His master followed and made repeated
efforts to recover him, but without success. This “fugitive slave
case” occurred about two years after the passage of the Fugitive
Slave Act of 1793. Slavery had previously been abolished in
Connecticut, and it does not appear on what ground the
reclamation was made. Prince, like his brother, married and
settled in Barre, where he is still living (August, 1856), at a very
advanced age. He is, perhaps,<hi rend="italics"> the last survivor of the
Massachusetts slaves.</hi>—C. E. S.</p>

          <head>SPEECH OF THEODORE PARKER AT THE FANEUIL HALL<lb/>
MEETING.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>[The speech which follows was phonographically reported for
the Worcester Daily Spy, It should have been inserted at page 39
of this volume, but I was not made aware that such a report, or
indeed that any report, was in existence, until a large part of the
work had been stereotyped.]</p>
          </argument>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Fellow-subjects of Virginia,</hi>—[loud cries of “no, no;” and 
“you must take that back!”] <hi rend="italics">Fellow-citizens of Boston, then,</hi>—
[“yes, yes,”]—I come to condole with you at this second
disgrace that is heaped on the city, made illustrious by <hi rend="italics">some</hi> of
those faces that were once so familiar to our eyes (alluding to
the portraits of the great men of the past, which <hi rend="italics">once hung</hi>
conspicuously in Faneuil Hall, but which have been removed to
obscure and out-of-the-way locations). Fellow-citizens, a deed
which Virginia commands has just been done in the city of John
Hancock, and the “brace of Adamses.” It was done by a Boston
hand. It was a Boston man who issued the warrant; it was a
Boston Marshal who put it in execution; they are Boston men
who are seeking to kidnap a citizen of Massachusetts, and send
him into slavery for ever and ever. It is our fault that it is so.
Eight years ago, a merchant of Boston “kidnapped a man on the
high road between Faneuil Hall and old Quincy,” at 12 o'clock—
at the noon of day; and the next day mechanics of this city
<pb id="steve290" n="290"/>
exhibited the half-eagles that they had received for their share
of the spoils, in enslaving a brother man. You called a meeting in
this hall. It was as crowded as it is now. I stood side by side
with my friend and former neighbor, your honorable and noble
chairman to-night [loud cheers], and that man who had fought
for the cause of liberty in Greece, and been imprisoned for that
sacred cause in the dungeons of Poland (Dr. Samuel G. Howe),
stood here and introduced to the audience that “old man
eloquent,” John Quincy Adams [loud cheers]. It was the last
time he ever stood in Faneuil Hall. He came to defend the
inalienable rights of a friendless negro slave, kidnapped in
Boston. There is even no picture of JOHN QUINCY ADAMS
to-night! A Suffolk grand jury could find no indictment against the
Boston merchant for kidnapping that man [“shame,” “shame”].
If Boston had spoken then, we should not have been here
to-night. We should have had no Fugitive Slave Bill. When
that bill passed, we fired a hundred guns. Don't you remember
the Union meeting, held in this very hall? A man stood on this
platform—he is a Judge of the Supreme Court now—and he
said, “When a certain ‘reverend gentleman’ is indicted for
perjury, I should like to ask him how he will answer the charge?”
And, when that “reverend gentleman” rose, and asked, “Do
you want an answer now to your question?” Faneuil Hall
cried out, “No,” “no,”—“Throw him over!” Had Faneuil Hall
spoken then on the side of truth and freedom, we should not
now be the subjects of Virginia. Yes, we are the <hi rend="italics">vassals</hi> of
Virginia. It reaches its arm over the graves of our mothers, and it
kidnaps men in the city of the Puritans, over the graves of
Samuel Adams and John Hancock [cries of “shame”].
Shame! So I say; but who
<pb id="steve291" n="291"/>
is to blame? “There is no North,” said Mr. Webster. There is
none. The South goes clear up to the Canada line. No,
gentlemen, there is no Boston to-day. There <hi rend="italics">was</hi> a Boston
once. Now, there is a north suburb to the city of Alexandria;
that is what Boston is [laughter]. And you and I, fellow-
subjects of the State of Virginia [cries of “no,” “no”]. I will take
it back when you show me the fact is not so. Men and brothers
(brothers, at any rate), I am an old man; I have heard hurrahs
and cheers for liberty many times; I have not seen a great many
<hi rend="italics">deeds</hi> done for liberty. I ask you, are we to have <hi rend="italics">deeds</hi> as well
as words? [“yes,” “yes,” and loud cheers.]</p>
          <p>Now, brethren,—you are brothers at any rate, whether
citizens of Massachusetts or subjects of Virginia,—(I am a
minister), and, fellow-citizens of Boston, there are two great
laws in this country; one of them is the LAW OF SLAVERY;
that law is declared to be a “finality.” Once the Constitution
was formed “to establish justice, promote tranquility, and
secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.”
<hi rend="italics">Now,</hi> the Constitution is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> to secure liberty; it is to <hi rend="italics">extend
slavery</hi> into Nebraska; and, when slavery is established there,
in order to show what it is, there comes a sheriff from
Alexandria to kidnap a man in the city of Boston, and he gets a
Judge of Probate, in the county of Suffolk, to issue a writ, and a
Boston man to execute that writ! [cries of “shame,” “shame.”]</p>
          <p>Slavery tramples on the Constitution it treads down State
rights. Where are the rights of Massachusetts? A Fugitive
Slave Law Commissioner has got them all in his pocket. Where
is the trial by jury? Watson Freeman has it under his Marshal's
staff Where is the great right of personal replevin, which our
fathers wrested, several hundred years ago, from the tyrants
who once lorded
<pb id="steve292" n="292"/>
it over Great Britain? Judge Sprague trod it under his feet!
Where is the sacred right of <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">habeas corpus?</hi></foreign> Deputy Marshal
Riley can crush it in his hands, and Boston does not say
anything against it. Where are the laws of Massachusetts
forbidding state edifices to be used as prisons for the
incarceration of fugitives? They, too, are trampled under
foot. “Slavery is a finality.”</p>
          <p>These men came from Virginia to kidnap a man here. Once,
this was Boston; now, it is a northern suburb of Alexandria. At
first, when they carried a fugitive slave from Boston, they
thought it was a difficult thing to do it. They had to get a
Mayor to help them; they bad to put chains round the Court
House; they bad to call out the “Sims' Brigade;” it took nine
days to do it. Now, they are so confident that we are subjects
of Virginia that they do not even, put chains round the Court
House; the police have nothing to do with it. I was told, to-day,
that one of the officers of the city said to twenty-eight
policemen, if any man in the employment of the city meddles
in this business, he will be discharged from service without a
hearing, [great applause]. Well, gentlemen, how do you think
they received that declaration? They shouted, and hurrahed,
and gave three cheers, [renewed applause.] My friend here
would not have the honor of presiding over you to-night, if
application had been made a little sooner to the Mayor.
Another gentleman told me that, when be was asked to preside
at this meeting, be said that he regretted that all his time to-night
was previously engaged. If he had known it earlier, he said,
he might have been able to make arrangements to preside.
When the man was arrested, he told the Marshal he regretted it,
and that his sympathies were wholly with the slave, [loud
applause]. Fellow-citizens, remember that word. Hold
<pb id="steve293" n="293"/>
Your Mayor to it, and let it be seen that he has got a
background, and a foreground, which will authorize him to
repeat that word in public, and act it out in Faneuil Hall.
I say, so confident are the slave agents now that they can
carry off their slave, in the day-time, that they do not put
chains round the Court House; they have got no soldiers
billeted in Faneuil Hall, as in 1851. They think they
can carry this man off to-morrow morning in a cab, [voices
—“they can't do it”—“let's see them try”].</p>
          <p>I say, there are two great laws in this country. One is the
slave law: that is the law of the President of the United States;
it is Senator Douglas's law; it is the law of the Supreme Court
of the United States; it is the law of the Commissioner; it is
the law of every Marshal, and of every meanest ruffian whom
the Marshal hires to execute his behests. There is another law,
which my friend, Mr. Phillips, has described in language
such as I cannot equal, and therefore shall not try; I only
state it in its plainest terms. It is the law of the people, when
they are sure they are right and determined to go ahead, [cheers].</p>
          <p>Now, gentlemen, there was a Boston once, and you and I
had fathers—brave fathers; and mothers who stirred up those
fathers to manly deeds. Well, gentlemen, once it came to pass
that the British Parliament enacted a “law”—<hi rend="italics">they</hi> called it a
law—issuing stamps here. What did your fathers do on that
occasion? They said, in the language of Algernon Sydney,
quoted in your resolutions, “That which is not just is not law,
and that which is not law ought not to be obeyed,” [cheers].
They did not obey the stamp act. They did not call it a <hi rend="italics">law,</hi>
and the man that did call it a law here, eighty years ago, would
have had a very warm coat of tar and feathers on him. They
called it an “act,” and they took the Commissioner who
<pb id="steve294" n="294"/>
was here to execute it, took him solemnly, manfully,—<hi rend="italics">they
didn't harm a hair of his head;</hi> they were non-resistants of a very
potent sort [laughter],—and made him take a solemn oath that
he would not issue a single stamp. He was brother-in-law of
the Governor of the State, the servant of a royal master,
exceedingly respectable, of great wealth, and once very
popular; but they took him, and made him swear not to
execute his commission; and he kept his oath, and the stamp
act went to its own place, and you know what that was,
[cheers]. That was an instance of the people going behind a
wicked law to enact absolute justice into their justice, and
making it common law. You know what they did with the tea.</p>
          <p>Well, gentlemen, in the South there is a public opinion (it is
a very wicked public opinion), which is stronger than law.
When a colored seaman goes to Charleston from Boston, he is
clapped instantly into jail, and kept there until the vessel is
ready to sail, and the Boston merchant or master must pay the
bill, and the Boston black man must feel the smart. That is a
wicked example, set by the State of South Carolina. When Mr.
Hoar, one of our most honored and respected fellow-citizens,
was sent to Charleston, to test the legality of this iniquitous
law, the citizens of Charleston ordered him off the premises,
and he was glad to escape, to save himself from further insult.
There was no violence, no guns fired. This is an instance of the
<hi rend="italics">strength of public opinion</hi>—of a most unjust and iniquitous
public opinion.</p>
          <p>Well, gentlemen, I say there is one law—slave law; it is
everywhere. There is another law, which also is a finality; and
that law, it is in your hands and your arms, and you can put
that in execution just when you see fit. Gentlemen, I am a
clergyman and a man of peace; I love
<pb id="steve295" n="295"/>
peace. But there is a means, and there is an end; liberty is the
end, and sometimes peace is not the means towards it
[applause]. Now I want to ask you what you are going to do [a
voice—“shoot, shoot”]. There are ways of managing this
matter, without shooting anybody. Be sure that these men who
have kidnapped a man in Boston are cowards, every mother's
son of them; and, if we stand up there resolutely, and declare
that this man shall not go out of the city of Boston, <hi rend="italics">without
shooting a gun</hi> —[cries of “<sic corr="that's">that 's</sic> it,” and great applause],—then
he won't go back. Now, I am going to propose that when you
adjourn, it be to meet in <hi rend="italics">Court Square to-morrow morning at
9 o'clock.</hi> As many as are in favor of that motion will raise
their hands, [a large number of hands were raised, but many
voices cried out, “Let's go to-night,” “let's pay a visit to the
slave-catchers at the Revere House,” etc., etc.] Do you propose
to go to the Revere House to-night? then show your hands,
[some hands were held up]. It is not a vote. We shall meet in
<hi rend="italics">Court Square at 9 o'clock to-morrow morning.</hi></p>
