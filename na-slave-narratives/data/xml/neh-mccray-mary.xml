        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>It is after much meditation and prayer that we undertake 
the task before us, for the reason that we feel keenly our inability 
to do justice in writing this book, the subject of which 
said many times during the last two years of her life that she 
believed that if the history of her life was written it would be 
a great blessing to many who are burdened down with the 
cares of this life, and who know nothing or little of Him who 
has said, “Cast all your burdens on Me, for I care for you.”
For we can truly say that the subject of this sketch did know 
some things about the trials of this life, for she was born in 
the <sic>dark dark</sic> days of slavery, when there was not a ray of 
light for the freedom of the colored race. We hope that the 
reader will bear with us for speaking of the bondage of the 
colored race in this United States, as the subject was once a 
slave, and the enslavement of the colored race was a terrible 
curse on the American people. Our blessed Lord, in His own 
good time, said that they had suffered enough, so slavery was 
destroyed by a terrible war and the loss of many lives. But 
at the present time there is a greater curse on this nation than 
the enslavement of the colored race, that is, the awful curse of 
the liquor traffic, which touches every man, woman and child. 
Many volumes might be written on this terrible curse, but it 
would be impossible to begin to tell of the suffering it brings 
			 <pb id="mccmary6" n="6"/>
to the human family. We say sometimes, Oh, Lord, how long 
wilt thou let this go on?</p>
        <p>The object in writing the life of this woman is not to make 
money, but it was her wish and desire, that it might be a great 
blessing to many readers, and to let them know what it is to 
live a holy, self-denial life amidst all the duties of this life,
for she was a good woman and full of the Holy Ghost and of 
faith. She did much good to all wherever her lot was cast. 
Hoping that this work may prove as great a blessing to its 
readers as it has to its author and those who helped in composing 
its pages, we dedicate this photograph of a woman of God 
to all that love a pure, clean, complete, and full salvation, 
free from all sin to all people in every land. </p>

          <p>Her father's name was Jonathan Taylor. He was born in  
Jefferson county, Kentucky. His master was his father, so  
that he was born free and did not serve as a slave. Her  
mother was born in old Hamilton county, of the same state.  
The date of their marriage could not be ascertained. To them  
were born sixteen children, fourteen girls and two boys, all  
destined to serve in slavery. Providentially, the owner of the  
subject's mother was an old maid. She was very good to her  
slave, and did not allow them to be abused, as were those belonging 
to many others. The subject's mother had all the care  
of her family herself, while her sister had all the clothes to  
make for all the rest of the slaves on the place. In addition  
she had much other work, which kept her busy every moment  
during the day and far into the night, so that she might earn  
a little money to buy her children some clothes to wear on  
Sunday. The holders did not make any provision for Sunday  
clothes for their slaves, but let them go any way, so that it  
was a hard and miserable life to live.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">BIRTH OF SUBJECT AND HER CHILDHOOD DAYS.</head>
          <p> The subject of this sketch was born <date value="1837-05-26">May 26, 1837.</date>She  
was the fifth child of the family, and was also the favorite  
child, as she was named after her mother. Her mother always  
said that she knew Fannie would get along well, as she was  
always ready to help her mother to do the work about the  
house, and loved to sow and knit and piece quilts. She had  
to do all this kind of work and did it mostly at night, as all  
the slaves were obliged to work out on the plantation, men,  
women and children, from morning  until night. </p>
          <p>The subject was always an obedient and tender hearted  
child, always inclined to be religious. Whenever she heard of  
the death of any one, her first inquiry was whether they had  
religion. She always thought that everybody who died must  
be converted, although she was not converted herself. </p>
          <p>Her father was a great violin player, and taught his  
daughter how to dance, as he was a very wicked man, and her  
mother was a wicked woman. So there were none in her family  
to encourage her to seek the Lord. Consequently, she began  
to be hardened in sin, and learned to be quite a dancer, in  
common with the rest of the young people in that neighborhood. 
<pb id="mccmary9" n="9"/> Her aunt was a good, Christian woman and was the  
first to speak to her about the salvation of her soul. Her  
aunt said to her one night while she was preparing to go to a  
ball, these words: “Fanny, when will you stop dancing?  
You will keep on until some of you will dance into hell.” She  
answered:“ Aunt Margaret (which was her aunt's name)  
this is my last time.” Her aunt then said: “Fanny, you  
are not only promising this to me, but to the Lord also.” The  
girl replied, “I did not know that the promise I made was to  
the Lord, too,” and from that time on the words of her aunt  
followed her until she was under deep conviction for the pardon  
of her sins. She was then about fourteen years of age.  </p>

          <head rend="capitalized">HER COMMISSION.</head>
          <p>In those days there were no churches for the slaves on the  
plantation, but they were compelled to go from one plantation  
to another to hold their meetings in their log cabins. She  
used to go with her aunt and others to those prayer meetings.  
The mighty power of God would be in the meetings. They  
would hold their meetings sometimes nearly all night. Many  
would fall under the mighty power of God, and many of them 
would get soundly converted.</p>
          <p>Our subject was greatly urged to seek the Lord. She went  
forward and soon found that she was a lost sinner without the  
blood of Jesus to wash away all her sins. </p>
          <p>They would  work hard all day in the corn fields and nearly 
every night would go two or three miles from home to attend  
meeting. Many were converted every night. She was somewhat 
discouraged because she was so slow to believe. Her  
cousin fell under the mighty power of God, and was happily 
converted, coming through shouting and praising God, and  
commenced at once to preach to the people, telling them to flee  
from the wrath to come. She said to our subject to believe  
and she would be converted. This encouraged her to go on.  
	<pb id="mccmary11" n="11"/>She was trying to get converted shouting, like her cousin, but  
the Dear Lord did not come to her in that way. She did reason 
with the devil for some time, who told her that if she did  
not shout she would not have religion. She had a terrible  
struggle to get over that. After that terrible struggle about  
getting converted shouting, her faith was greatly increased, and 
while she was praying one day she was wonderfully blessed.  
She told her cousin how she felt. Her cousin told her that she  
had religion. She said, “Oh, no, I am just getting in a good  
way.” She did not understand the scheme of the devil, so she  
was defeated and had to do her work all over again . But the  
Holy Spirit still strove with her. The meetings were still going 
on with increased power. She attended nearly ever night.  
The old people encouraged her, and then she began to take part  
in speaking and praying. By so doing the same blessing came  
to her again, but she was not satisfied. She went on in that  
state quite a long time. Finally one night she went to bed and  
fell into a dream, or trance, she did not know which. However 
a man came to her while she was in that vision. She was  
trying to cross a clear stream of water. The man she believed  
to be a white man. He threw a narrow board in the middle of  
the stream of water, and there was also a broad board in the  
stream. The man told her to make her choice. She stepped  
on the narrow one and went across. As soon as she was across  
he showed her a beautiful place and told her it was heaven.  
She saw her cousin there and she was with all the angels. They  
were all just alike. She turned to come back, when she heard  
a voice saying: “You have just as much religion as those who  
shout.”After that she woke up. She felt very strange and  
told her aunt about the vision. Her aunt said that she would  
 <pb id="mccmary12" n="12"/>get through all right. In a short time afterwards she received  
the witness of the Holy Spirit that her sins were all forgiven.  
She was then a happy girl. She knew that her sins were all  
washed away by the blood of Jesus. She could sing this song:</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l n="1" rend="PRE ldquo">“Oh! happy day, that fixed my choice,</l>
            <l n="2"> On Thee, my Savior and my God;  </l>
            <l n="3"> Well may this glowing heart rejoice,</l>
            <l n="4" rend="POST rdquo ">And tell its rapture all abroad.” </l>
            <l n="5" rend="PRE ldquo">“Happy day! Happy day! </l>
            <l n="6">When Jesus washed my sins away. </l>
            <l n="7">He taught me how to watch and pray,</l>
            <l n="8">And live rejoicing every day, </l>
            <l n="9">Happy day! Happy day! </l>
            <l n="10" rend="POST rdquo">When Jesus washed my sins away.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The meeting spread from one plantation to another, and  
many of the poor slaves' hearts were made to rejoice, for the  
Lord Jesus visited them, notwithstanding they were treated  
only as cattle and horses. Thanks be unto the Lord God of  
Heaven, who did look down upon them in their helpless condition 
in tender mercy. </p>
          <p>The subject of this sketch was a faithful young Christian,  
laboring in the prayer meetings from house to house. They did  
not have churches of their own. She related that one night  
their prayer meeting continued until daylight, the power of  
God having fallen upon the people in such a wonderful manner  
that they fell on the floor like dead men and women. Many  
of them had to go one, two and three miles to their homes, and  
some of them were greatly punished for being away from their  
houses at that late hour of night, for most all of them were,  
  <pb id="mccmary13" n="13"/>compelled to go to work before daylight. But in spite of all  
this cruel treatment they would pray and sing so that it would  
disturb their old masters so that they could not sleep and they  
would whip them, but still the poor slaves would continue to  
serve the Lord.</p>
          <p>Our subject said that one of the masters in that part of  
Kentucky, a cruel slave holder whose name we can not recall,  
had a slave (a man) by  the name of Dick, who was a true man  
of God. His master was so bitterly opposed to his serving the  
Lord as not to even permit him to return thanks at the table  
before taking his meals. But Dick had settled the matter, and  
the more his master would punish him the more he would pray  
for his master.  At length his prevailing prayer with his God  
was the salvation of his master, and he was converted in a  
wonderful manner at a camp meeting.  Dick was present, and  
his master ran to him, threw his arms around him and took  
him up and carried him around in the camp ground. After his   
conversion he set Dick free, and, giving him a horse, saddle  
and bridle, told  him to go and preach the gospel everywhere.  
He also set free all the rest of  his slaves. Oh, it is wonderful
how God can use a man. This is true  </p>

        <pb id="mccmary14" n="14"/>

          <head rend="capitalized">CHAPTER  IV.</head>
          <p>Our subject's associations were mostly among the old 
Christians, and her Christian life was far in advance of many 
of her elders. So much was this the case that some of the 
older Christians would tell her that she could live in that 
happy state of mind. She thought this very strange talk for 
the elder Christians to tell to young converts, but it was her 
delight to serve the Lord. In her younger days she would work 
hard all day in the field with the rest of the field hands, and 
then would walk to a prayer meeting, should there chance to 
be one anywhere in the neighborhood. Frequently she would 
walk a distance of two or three miles. This song was her inspiring 
hope: </p>
          <lg>
            <l n="1">Oh, how happy are they who their Savior obey,</l>
            <l n="2">And have laid up their treasures above.</l>
            <l n="3">Tongue can never express the sweet comfort and peace </l>
            <l n="4">Of the soul in its earliest love.</l>
            <l n="5">That sweet comfort was mine when the favor divine </l>
            <l n="6">I first found in the blood of the Lamb.</l>
            <l n="7">When my heart first believed, what a joy I received, </l>
            <l n="8">What a heaven in Jesus' name.</l>
            <l n="9">Jesus all the day long was my joy and my song, </l>
            <l n="10">Oh, that all His salvation might see.</l>
            <l n="11">He hath loved me, I cried, He has suffered and died, </l>
            <l n="12">To redeem even rebels like me. </l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="mccmary15" n="15"/>
          <p>Her life was a life of joy in serving the Lord. Her mistress, 
who, as before stated, was an old maid, and very kind to 
her slaves. It was the custom among slave owners to hire a 
poor white man as overseer. Most all overseers were very cruel 
to the slaves in their charge. Our subject's mistress always 
had an overseer, but did not allow him to treat her slaves illy, 
so they were favored in the way of kind treatment above all 
the other slaves in the neighborhood in which she lived. Also 
some of the slaves might have had somewhat of an education 
had they wanted it, but not knowing that they ever would be 
free failed to take advantage of the opportunity. As slaves, 
they did not need an education. Slaves in those days did not 
know the words in a book, but they did know how to serve the 
Lord. Our subject's trial was as a Christian. Her mother was 
sick most of the time, and her mistress finally became impatient 
and offered her for sale to her father for the sum of 
fifty dollars. But he would not buy her, as he said he could 
have no use for slaves subject to ill health all the time. But 
had she been a healthy woman this man could not have 
bought her for less than five or six hundred dollars. Slave 
women always sold as high in price as men. Good able bodied 
slaves never sold for less than from six to nine hundred dollars. 
A good carpenter, blacksmith or bricklayer always sold for 
from one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars. The reader will 
have an idea from this how those poor human beings were 
bought and sold as horses and cattle.</p>
          <p>Her mother had another very severe attack of sickness, 
worse than she had ever had, and the doctors said she must 
die. She was now under a very heavy burden. The thought 
that her mother might die without being consecrated brought 
<pb id="mccmary16" n="16"/>
her faith to a severe test, as she was only a young Christian.
In these hours of trouble and bewilderment she called upon 
the Lord, as Jacob did in the days of old. She wrestled in 
prayer and expressed her thoughts to God for the salvation of 
her mother. Her prayers were answered. Her mother became 
suddenly converted and lived a long time afterward. She 
finally died triumphant in the faith of Christ and went home 
to glory. It was a very great trial for her to see her mother die
and leave all of them behind. The youngest child was only 
three years old, but the dear Lord gave her grace to bear up 
under her burdens, all for His name's sake, for we know that 
He does all things for the best.</p>
          <p>Her mother then being gone, all the responsibilities of the 
family fell upon her, as her father did not live on the same 
plantation with them. He only came home once a week, so 
that not much of the family cares could rest upon him. She 
had to fill the place in the household which her mother had 
occupied, as her sister did not take much interest in the care 
of the children. She was the only one in the family who was 
a Christian. From this she learned much about the strong 
arm of the Lord, who has promised to be with us six hours, 
and in the seventh He will not forsake us. Oh, how we ought 
to praise God for His wonderful saving grace. </p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE DEATH OF HER MISTRESS.</head>
          <p>Our subject's mistress died in the year A. D. 1859. She 
stated in her will that all her relations, each and every one, 
should have a share in her estate. Then her slaves were to be 
set free and a certain sum of money was set apart to bring 
them to the state of Ohio, and also enough money to buy 
eighty acres of land for each of the two families. Our subject's 
father's family was one of the two, and her mother's 
sister's family was the other. The name of the sister was 
Margaret Taylor. Most all the slaves of the mistress was embraced 
in those two families. A short time after her estate 
was settled, some of her relations were enraged because Aunt 
Polly Adams, as they called her, had set her slaves free. So 
some of them began at once an attempt to break the will. Miss 
Polly Adams was never a married lady. She had made two 
wills, and it was the last one that contained the provisions for 
the freedom of her slaves and their removal to Ohio. However 
her relations kept the slaves there for three years while 
they were trying to break the will. One complaint was that 
Miss Polly had willed real estate to her slaves. Their lawyers 
informed them that it was useless for them to complain, as
<pb id="mccmary18" n="18"/>
the will could never be broken. Then the freed slaves were 
told to go to the place assigned to them. They were not long 
in getting to this place, as they were only three miles from the 
Ohio river. They took the steamer at a place called Hannily's 
Landing for Cincinnati. After their arrival in that city they 
met a gentleman who had been notified of three colored people 
who had just arrived from the South and was ready to take 
care of them. The writer can truly say that Mr. Coffin was a 
true friend indeed to colored people. For many years he was 
the leading man of the city, and helped many poor slaves from 
the land of bondage to the land of freedom.</p>
          <p>In the dark days of slavery, when the black laws of the 
United States was in force, which carried a penalty of five 
hundred dollars fine and several years in the penitentiary for 
any person that would assist a slave to escape from bondage to 
freedom, the writer can say that many white men of the northern 
states gave up their property, yes, and some of them their 
lives, in rescuing poor slaves from their bondage. Mr. Levi 
Coffin stood at the head of his followers in this noble work of 
rescuing slaves that came into the city of Cincinnati. This 
man's house was the union depot of all underground railways.</p>
          <p>It may be better to explain what is meant by the underground 
railway.  It means that white men organized themselves 
into a body to help those poor slaves who had energy and perseverance 
enough to run away from bondage and seek a land of 
liberty. They would establish stations a number of miles apart, 
generally at the house of one of the members. They would 
conceal the slaves who chanced to be under their protection 
during the daytime, but as soon as the shades of night began 
to fall the slaves were placed in covered wagons and taken,

concealed as freight, to another one of the stations. This process 
was kept up until they reached the union depot, and then 
they were  transferred into Canada, this being the only place 
where runaway slaves were sure of a safe refuge. Hundreds 
sought their freedom in this manner.</p>
          <p>The writer can say that the colored people were subjected 
to a great deal of abuse and ill treatment at the hands of the 
white people of the North, not because they were less worthy of 
respect than any other people, but simply because their faces 
were black. The story of the terrible suffering of the colored 
people of the South at the close of the war has never yet been 
printed. Many of the rebels would mask themselves and amuse 
themselves by horse-whipping the poor slaves. Yes, and even 
assassinate them, taking the lives of whole families. These 
crimes continued for years, but those cruel days have been 
washed away by the tide of time, never to return again. </p>
          <p>It has been said that our race of people can never stand on 
a level with the whites, but we candidly deny that statement. 
The white race has been more than five thousand years climbing 
the ladder of fame, while the colored race has only had opportunities 
for improvement for about two hundred years. 
But in the last twenty-five years the progress of the Negro race 
has been wonderful. We believe that had proper steps been 
taken and careful observations made of the condition of affairs 
in the South at the close of the war, the Negro race would be 
seventy years in advance of the position it occupies to-day. 
The bloody war resulted in envy, hatred, strife, malice and 
prejudice between the black and the white, which is sin of the 
worst nature. There was no kind of brotherly love shown, but, 
rather, man's inhumanity to man, which has caused countless 
 <pb id="mccmary20" n="20"/>
thousands to mourn. Christ teaches us to love one another, 
and nothing but the blood of Christ can remedy this condition 
and save people from all evil.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE PURCHASE OF LAND FOR THE TAYLOR FAMILY.</head>
          <p>Mr. Coffin took charge of the two families of Taylors. 
That was also the name of the husband of the aunt of our subject, 
although he was no relative to her father. Mr. Coffin 
looked out for a location for the families, and succeeded in renting 
two large houses, in which they began to keep house. In 
the family of which our subject was a member there were no 
boys, the two born into the family having died when quite 
young. Consequently the large girls had to do all the hard 
work. Some of them went to work in private families.</p>
          <p>They remained in the city quite a long time, but at least 
Mr. Coffin went to Mercer county, Ohio, to buy them a farm 
with the money left them by their mistress. This was sufficient 
to buy them one hundred and sixty acres of good land. 
It took him some time to bargain for a farm, but he finally 
succeeded, having purchased one that was well timbered. He 
then returned to the city and reported his success. It was then
<pb id="mccmary21" n="21"/>
some time before they could move, as there were no railroads 
in that country in those days, the only way of transportation 
being the canal. They packed their goods and started on a 
canal boat for their new home. This mode of travel was very 
poor, as compared with the quick transportation of the present 
day, as the boats were drawn by mules or horses, and hence but 
slow progress was made. At length, however, at the end of 
thirteen days they arrived at New Bremen, Mercer county, 
Ohio, their farm being about twelve miles from that place. 
The neighbors in that settlement kindly consented to let them 
have the use of their teams with which to remove their goods to 
their farm.</p>
          <p>On each of the farms there was a log cabin. Each farm contained 
eighty acres, and our subject moved onto the west 
eighty, of which there was only a few acres cleared. She had 
no brothers to assist her father in the heavy work, such as chopping 
down the heavy timber, splitting rails, and clearing off 
the land in general to get it ready for farming. Her father 
knew very little about farming, and as before stated the cares 
of the family rested very lightly upon him. For this reason it
was very hard for them to get along well. Worse than all, 
everybody in the neighborhood were in about the same condition, 
so they could receive no help. Things looked very dark 
and gloomy for them, and especially just after the close of the 
civil war, when prices on all commodities were so high. There 
was but little land cleared in all the neighborhood on which to 
raise anything to sell. The only escape her father had was to 
cut down his best oak timber and saw it into blocks, in which 
shape it was sold for making barrels, kegs and other wood vessels. 
Many farmers did great damage to their farms by cutting 
<pb id="mccmary22" n="22"/>
 their oak timber so soon. Many of them had three or 
four boys and the farms were cleared in a short time. In the 
family of our subject, however, there was no one who understood 
this kind of work, her father having been a distiller by occupation. 
We are sorry to say that while engaged in this sort of 
work the appetite for strong drink fascinated him, and found 
him intoxicated many times and brought home in that condition. 
To his credit be it said that he never abused his family,
as is the case with so many drinking men while under the influence 
of liquor.</p>
          <p>Our subject was compelled to take almost entire charge of 
the family, to be, so to speak, father, mother and sister all at 
the same time. She would help her father, who was of a delicate 
constitution, at much of his hard work. Sometimes they 
would hire a man to help at this. She would even chop wood 
and help load it on wagons. This she had to do in order to 
earn enough money to procure the necessities of life. Many a 
time she would be at her wit's end to know what to do in order 
to keep the family from want, and scarcely knew what to do. 
But she knew there was One who would not forsake her, so she 
called upon the Lord, who has said, “In the days of trouble I 
will deliver thee,” and we can say that our blessed Lord did 
help her in the time of need. </p>

          <head rend="capitalized">FARM LIFE CONTINUES.</head>
          <p>The farm life continued with increased trials and burdens. 
Her father was at length confined to his bed from receiving a 
bad injury to one of his limbs. He was not able to do any work 
for six months or more. Many doctors were consulted, but 
none could give him relief. The neighbors were very kind to 
her, and helped her in many ways during her father's affliction. 
This was a great trial for her, one of the greatest she was ever 
called upon to endure, but she did not forget to cast her 
burdens upon One who has said, “Cast all your burdens upon 
Me, for I care for you.” There were also many precious 
promises in the Bible, such as: “I will never leave thee, nor 
forsake thee,” and “Call upon me in the days of trouble and I 
will deliver thee in due time.”</p>
          <p>One day a young doctor by the name of Thomas was passing 
through the neighborhood. He had the reputation of being 
a very skillful physician, and she went to see him. She told 
him of the condition of her father, and the doctor made her 
some salve and told her how to use it on her father's limb. 
She went home and began to do as the doctor had directed and 
in a short time her father was once more able to breath fresh
<pb id="mccmary24" n="24"/>
air, to work and help care for his family. Then affairs moved 
along very well, but in the same old channel, and with but 
little prospects for improvement in the way of monetary matters. 
Some of her sisters became very much discouraged because 
of the hard times they had in getting along, and three of 
them went back to Cincinnati to work by the week, agreeing to 
send money back to assist in helping support the rest of the 
family. Thus was a great strain lifted from the family, and it 
was a great help, too, as the three girls did as they had agreed.
Yet our subject had hard trials. She was the life of the family, 
and, with all, the only Christian in this large family of girls. 
This caused her to realize that she must let her light shine as 
a Christian in the home before her sisters and father. </p>
          <p>Christianity had but few adherents in the neighborhood 
surrounding her home, either among the old or young. Her 
mind would often turn to her former experiences as a Christian. 
This would cause her to realize that she had lost much of the 
joy of the Lord out of her soul. Often, when she would go out 
among the young people and see many of them who professed 
to be Christians enjoying themselves among the sinners, the 
devil would tempt her, saying: “Why don't you enjoy yourself 
like the other young people; they profess to be Christians 
as well as you.”But she could never do like the rest of them, 
for she knew what great things God had done for her in these 
trials and temptations, and she called upon Him to give her 
grace so that she might not yield to the devil and take part in 
the outbroken sins like some of the old and young about her, 
many of whom professed to be Christians, but who were merely 
using Christianity as a cloak to protect them in the service of 
the devil. The Omnipotent One watched with His tender 
<pb id="mccmary25" n="25"/>
mercies over her, and gave her the utmost strength and grace 
to endure such vital temptations, and to let her light shine so 
that all men might see her good works in the vineyard of our 
Lord.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">DEATH OF HER SISTER, SIDNEY ANN.</head>
          <p>Our Savior said in His blessed word that in this world ye 
shall have trials and tribulations, but in peace. Sidney Ann 
went to a neighboring town to work, where she had been for 
about a month when she caught a severe cold that settled on 
her lungs. This weakened her so that she was unable to work, 
and in consequence went home, where she soon took to her bed. 
She was tenderly waited on and everything was done that 
might relieve her from her sufferings. But nothing did her 
much good and it was thought that she must die. Our subject 
thought that her sister was living a sinful life and was not 
prepared to meet her God. Sidney Ann was told that she 
could not <sic corr="recover">recovor,</sic>and our subject earnestly beseeched the 
Lord to have mercy on her sister and save her from her sins. 
At the same time she told her sister she must pray for herself. 
Our subject gave herself much to prayer. She also called on 
<pb id="mccmary26" n="26"/>
some of the neighbors to come in and help pray for her sister, 
that she might awaken to a sense of her lost condition. She 
still continued to pray by day and by night that her prayers in 
behalf of her dying sister might be answered. The neighbors 
called frequently and much prayer was offered up to the Lord. 
Finally, her sister awoke and aid that she was a lost soul, 
without  the blood of Jesus might be applied to her heart
to wash away her sins and cleanse her from all <sic>unrighteousness.</sic>She then began to pray, cry and scream for mercy. 
Our subject's faith was strengthened to see her sister break 
down and pray for the Lord to forgive her and make her pure 
and holy before she died. Our subject said that the dear Lord, 
in His tender mercies, did come to her sister's heart, and broke 
the bands of unbelief and allowed her poor captive soul to go 
free. At last the cloud of darkness was dispelled from her 
soul, and nothing but light, joy and gladness broke forth in 
superabundance from the soul that once was darkened in sin, 
and now she could sing.</p>
          <lg rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">
            <l n="1">“On Christ the solid rock I stand, </l>
            <l n="2"> All other ground is sinking sand.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Our subject's heart was made to leap with joy and gladness 
when she saw her sister so filled with the presence and 
power of the Lord Jesus. Though she did not live long to tell 
the beautiful story of Christ, yet she lost no opportunity in 
telling every one who came to see her. She lived only four 
months after she was taken ill. In full triumph of living faith 
she went sweeping through the gates of that eternal city whose 
streets are paved with gold, that city where life is everlasting,
and where we see our departed ones. Our subject was now 
<pb id="mccmary27" n="27"/>
greatly encouraged, more than ever before, to live the life of 
the righteous. Oh, what a mistake mankind is making in delaying 
to seek the Lord for the salvation of their souls until 
they are upon the bed of death. Thousands and thousands 
miss heaven by so doing. Even should any be saved at that 
late hour they must go, as did our sister, empty handed into 
the presence of the Master, and without a star in their crowns. 
Oh, dear reader, do not wait, for the blessed word says: 
“To-day is the day of salvation.”</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">CHAPTER  X .</head>
          <head rend="capitalized">SPIRITUAL CONDITION OF PEOPLE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.</head>
          <p> The spiritual condition of the people in the neighborhood 
at that time was very poor. There were three churches, two 
Methodist and one Baptist, all situated very close to each 
other. The members of these churches did not think much 
about serving the Lord. Most of them, both old and young, 
were leaders in play parties that met from house to house, and 
one devil could watch them, as they were not engaged in the 
service of the Lord. The principal amusement at these parties 
was dancing, and many of the older members would take active 
part with the younger people in that kind of sport and fun. 
<pb id="mccmary28" n="28"/>Our subject would sometimes yield to the temptation and go 
and look on. While she was doing this the tempter would 
whisper in her ear: “Why are you looking so sanctimonious? 
These young people are all Christians, and so are the older 
ones. Why do you not take part with them? You are no 
better than they.” She would answer within herself, that is 
so. The writer will say that at times a converted person will 
be tempted to listen to the tempter and desire worldly pleasure. 
The devil will say that it matters not. If you have the 
word of God in your heart that should not keep you from 
having a little worldly pleasure. Other professors of religion 
do the very same things and why not you? There are many
truly converted souls that have not had the proper teaching in 
the early part of their Christian experience. They should be 
taught how to resist the devil and keep from yielding to him, 
and to shun worldly enjoyments. But if these rules are not 
followed out the Lord will depart from them, and, step by 
step, the adversary will lead them on and on, testifying for 
the Lord when they are in utter darkness, and perhaps have 
been for weeks and months, in their wild excitement.</p>
          <p>At the dancing parties some of the younger ones would 
try to persuade our subject to join them in dancing. When the 
music would start it was a very strong temptation to resist 
dancing after music having been of her greatest enjoyments before 
her conversion. In those moments of temptation the Lord 
would give her grace to resist the devil.</p>
          <p>There are thousands and thousands of professors in the 
churches to-day who take part in worldly enjoyments, and 
know nothing of the spirit of the Lord. Many of these were 
once happily converted. The great cause of so much backsliding
<pb id="mccmary29" n="29"/>
 is that we have not ministers and leaders who are living 
up to their professions. They have lost the realization of the 
spirit of Christ, and therefore, they can not lead the young 
souls into fountains of living waters. We all know that it is 
impossible for the blind to lead the blind, as they will both 
fall. So both preacher and members drift along the broad 
path that leads to death eternal night. Oh, what a fearful responsibility 
rests upon a pastor who says he is called to preach 
the gospel to dying men and women. Oh, may the dear Lord 
wake up these dead souls that are sleeping on and will not be 
awakened, because they pay their pastors big salaries to let 
them sleep on in their sins. They think they are saved because 
they are members of the church and pay the preacher his dues. 
But in that great judgment day they will hear the woeful cry, 
“Depart from Me, ye churches, into the lake of everlasting 
burning, prepared for the devil and his angels.”</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">ANOTHER SISTER NIPPED BY THE FROST OF TIME.</head>
          <p> It was scarcely a year after the death of Sidney Ann before 
another sister was taken with the same complaint. A heavy 
cold settled on her lungs and nothing could be done for her, as 
<pb id="mccmary30" n="30"/>
it speedily developed into quick consumption which dreadful 
disease can not be cured. Sarah, like the other sister, had no 
hope in Christ, and now, upon her dying bed, must seek salvation 
for her poor immortal soul, at an hour almost too late. 
Our subject saw that no time was to be lost, and so, as heretofore, 
she prayed that God might save her sister, as it would not 
do for her to pass away without eternal life. The sister, like 
the other one, was hard to believe, but finally she gave up all 
to him who has said: “Son, or daughter, the day thou givest 
Me thine heart I will be fond of thee,” and, with one mighty 
act of living faith in the all-obtaining blood of the Lord Jesus,
the great burden of sin was rolled from her heart and her soul 
was filled with joy and peace. She died shortly after her conversion 
in the full triumph of living faith, but met her Savior 
empty handed. Oh, how good and blessed is the Lord Jesus, 
who allows us to live through all our sins and when the time 
arrives for us to die saves us from our iniquities. This is evidence 
that God has promised to answer the prayers of His dear 
children who pray to Him by day and by night. It is wonderful 
how God allows mankind to live in their sins, until death 
stares them in the face, and then saves them.</p>
          <p>To all those who may read this book, the writer wishes to 
say: Do not do as this young woman did. The devil will no 
doubt try you while you are reading this book, and whisper to 
you that you can be converted on your death bed, but the 
blessed book says: “To-day is the day of salvation.” See at 
once, dear reader, that the word of your God does not come into 
contact with the evil <sic>suggestings</sic> of the devil. The devil suggests 
to thousands that they wait until they are on a sick bed 
before seeking the Lord. He also suggests the same thing to 
<pb id="mccmary31" n="31"/>
many believers, telling them that they need not pray and talk 
so much about living a holy life, as there will be plenty of time
to attend to that after they are taken down sick. Thousands 
of poor souls are thus deceived and take refuge in the devil. 
Often their lives are cut off without warning, and many are 
thus cast into the lake of everlasting fire. Oh, may our blessed 
Lord assist the millions of souls who are waiting for repentance 
upon the death bed to make up their minds at once to serve 
Him. </p>
          <p>Our subject lifted up her heart in praise unto the Lord for 
helping her to bear up under the great trial of burying two of 
her sisters within one year. With all the care of the family 
bearing heavily upon her, the Lord lent her a helping hand, and 
gave her strength to endure the trials. While living  in the 
country our subject became quite familiar with the ways of the 
Northern people. She found great difference between them and 
the slaves in the South. The slaves had no work to manage or 
plan for. There was always some one to do the planning and 
buying and selling for them. In the North she had all this to 
do for herself, in addition to the care of the family. Her 
father cared very little about business, and he would allow some 
of the neighbors to take advantage of him. He was kind-
hearted and would not have trouble with anyone, even if he 
was getting the worst of the bargain. So our subject had to 
spend most of her time in transacting the business of the farm. 
Her father thought every one was honest like himself. He always 
carried the motto, “Honesty is the best policy,” stamped 
in his heart. At one time he was swindled very badly by one
of his neighbors, a man that owned a saw mill, and who was 
buying all the timber he could get, especially oak and walnut, 
<pb id="mccmary32" n="32"/>
which were very valuable and commanded a high price. This 
mill owner had the reputation of being a very dishonest man, 
and would get the better of all who transacted business with 
him if possible, and her father was no exception. He hauled 
timber enough to build a new house, and when he went for the 
lumber prepared from his logs he found that the mill owner had 
exchanged poor lumber for the fine logs he had taken there. 
When our subject saw how her father had been swindled, she 
resolved that it was to the interest of the family for her to take 
more interest in the buying and selling.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">OUR SUBJECT LEAVES HOME TO WORK.</head>
          <p>Finally the family became so greatly in need of clothing 
that it became necessary for our subject to go from home to 
work and earn money. Some of the other sisters had worked 
away from home, but they did not help the family as much as 
they should have done. They had the interests of the family 
very little at heart, and spent their money on themselves. So 
there was no way for her to do but to earn the needed money. 
There was no place in the neighborhood to work, as the settlers 
were all poor like herself. She told her father that she must 
<pb id="mccmary33" n="33"/>
go to some town to earn money to buy them some clothing, 
as their supply was nearly gone. Her father said he did not 
see how he could get along without her. But she told him that 
she must go, as he could get but very little work to do. After 
making all necessary preparations, in company with her sister 
Charlotte and a cousin, she was soon on her way to Lima, 
Ohio, about forty miles from home. They had to work most 
all the way, as they had no money. They had taken only a 
few things with them. It was a long journey for these three 
young women to make without any one to accompany and
guide them. Our subject knew something about the help of 
the Lord, therefore she trusted in Him to protect her from any 
harm or danger. They were very prosperous in their first day's 
journey, and after walking thirty miles, a kind friend took 
them in, gave them plenty to eat and shelter for the night. 
The next morning they were very much refreshed, but did not 
get a very early start, as they had only a little over twelve 
miles to go.</p>
          <p>They arrived in Lima early in the afternoon of the second 
day, and found a stopping place at the home of Mrs. ——,
who was kind enough to keep them two or three days until 
they could find places to work. Within a week her sister 
found a place in a private family, as did her cousin also. As 
for herself, Mrs. —— thought she could earn more in working 
by the day, so, making Mrs. ——'s house her headquarters, 
assisting her when she had no work elsewhere, she did a great 
deal of work for other people. She stayed with Mrs. ——
a long time, but at length she discovered that Mrs. —— did 
not do right. Many things caused her pain, but she bore it as 
long as she thought best. She found out so many tricks this
<pb id="mccmary34" n="34"/>woman was capable of and yet she claimed to be a member of 
the church. An instance of the manner in which she was 
treated. At one time Mrs. —— concealed a silver thimble 
and charged her with stealing it. This seemed to be a very 
severe charge to make against one who was a perfect stranger, 
and it was all she could do to endure it. She was conscious of 
the fact, however, that her God knew she was not a thief. She 
assisted Mrs. —— searching all over the house for the lost 
thimble, but it could not be found: at length she told Mrs.
—— that she would pay for it, but she answered she was not 
worrying about her paying for it, but the trouble was to clear 
herself of the charge of theft. She was at her wit's end, but 
remembering the words of her blessed Master, “Call upon Me 
in the days of thy trouble, and I will deliver thee,” she decided
to bide her time. She paid Mrs. —— for the thimble. Not 
long afterwards she was sweeping and dusting two or three 
rooms in the house, and while placing everything in its proper 
place she found the thimble. She called Mrs. —— and told 
her that she had found the lost thimble, but received the reply 
that she was as the possessor of two thimbles. It so happened 
that a minister was boarding at the house. He overheard 
the conversation, and, stepping into the room, told 
Mrs. —— that he had heard her accuse several other girls in 
regard to that thimble. He then spoke to her of the way she 
was treating our subject by accusing her of stealing. At this 
Mrs. —— cried and went out of the room, leaving our subject 
to finish her work of cleaning the house. She felt in her 
heart that she was cleared of the charge of stealing the thimble,
and that it was through the help of the dear Lord that her deliverance
 had come. It is a very distressing thing to be caught 
<pb id="mccmary35" n="35"/>
in a lie. Afterward, Mrs. ——'s next door neighbor told 
how she had told lies about her, and about the minister also, 
and of the things Mrs. —— had stolen from her boarders and 
other people who came about the house.</p>
          <p> Our subject did not have any confidence in Mrs. —— as 
one claiming to be a Christian. Though acquainted with the 
character of Mrs. —— our subject still remained in her house. 
Soon after the trouble about the thimble a lady wanted our 
subject to do some work for her. Not having the money to 
pay she offered a good second hand carpet in payment. Our 
subject agreed to do the work for the carpet. It was a rag 
carpet and would be of good service on the farm. While our 
subject was working for another lady, Mrs. ——, who was 
acquainted with the lady that had the carpet, told her that she 
would do the work and take the carpet as pay, but the lady 
answered that she had engaged Mary Taylor to do the work.  
Mrs. —— stated that Mary Taylor did not want the carpet. 
The lady did not know what to think about Mrs ——'s 
statement, as there had been no time set when our subject 
should do the work. The lady did not know what to do, so 
she said: “If Mary does not want the carpet you may do the 
work,” and adding, “but I do not know why Mary should 
change her mind in regard to it.” The lady felt that something 
was wrong, but allowed Mrs. —— to do the work, and 
our subject had no knowledge that it had been performed. At 
length, having some spare time she decided to do the work and 
get the carpet. She arrived at the house and was much surprised 
when the lady told her that she had been told that she 
did not want the carpet. Our subject asked the name of the 
party who made the statement and was told that it was Mrs. 
<pb id="mccmary36" n="36"/>
——. She answered that she had never spoken to Mrs.
—— about the carpet. When she asked Mrs. —— about 
the matter she answered that she did not think our subject had 
any use for the carpet. She refused to have any trouble about 
the carpet but now saw how Mrs. —— had told another 
falsehood to cheat her out of the carpet. All her troubles 
proved to be a blessing, however, to her as a follower of the 
Lord Jesus, who said in His blessed word that “All things 
work together for good to those who love and serve Him.” She 
now saw that it was not best to stay longer with Mrs. ——.
She found another home with a near neighbor by the name of 
Mrs. Harris, who was very kind to her and permitted her to 
make the house her home while she worked out by the day. 
She only remained here long enough to fulfill all her engagements, 
when she began to prepare to return home. Her stay 
in Lima had been quite profitable, and in addition to a nice 
little sum of money, she carried with her a number of articles 
of clothing and household goods received in exchange for her 
labor, for all of which she returned thanks to our dear Lord for 
His love and kindness toward her.</p>

          <p>She arrived at her home and found her father and sisters
<pb id="mccmary37" n="37"/>
all very well. As soon as she had rested she began to look after 
the work, as usual, both in the house and on the farm. Everything 
was now moving along very well. The money she had 
earned while away from home was of great use to her father 
and sisters. It may now be seen more than ever the great part 
she took in managing the family affairs. Indeed her share was 
greater than the work performed by her mother, who had only 
a family and a house to look after, while she not only filled her
mother's place in the home, but her father's place on the farm, 
also. At this time she was about twenty-four years of age and 
was strong and usually had good health.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">ANOTHER SISTER NIPPED BY THE FROST OF TIME.</head>
          <p>About a year and a half after the death of her sister Sarah,
another sister, Martha, was taken sick very suddenly with a 
heavy cold, like her other two sisters. They began at once to 
give Martha treatment, and in four or five weeks she began to 
grow better and continued to improve until she was able to go 
about the house. Our subject thought she was so much better 
that it would be safe to leave her in the care of her father and 
other sisters, as she had some work that called her away from
<pb id="mccmary38" n="38"/>
home. She told her father that while she was gone he must 
take good care of Martha, and not allow her to go out of doors. 
After our subject had gone Martha continued to feel better and 
was getting along nicely. While she was away Martha concluded 
she felt well enough to go to a party, and decided to attend 
one given in the neighborhood. Our subject did not want 
Martha to go, fearing that she might take cold, but Martha, 
like all young girls, who are not truly Christians, love to go 
where there is fun and frolic, no matter what anyone might say. 
In going and coming from the party she got her feet wet and 
was again taken down sick. Everything was done to save her, 
but to no avail and she must die, praying on her death bed and 
with no hope for eternal life. Our subject remembered the 
words of the thief on the cross: “Lord, when Thou comest 
into Thy kingdom, remember me.” The Lord said: “This 
day thou shalt be with Me.” She told Martha that she must 
pray and call on the Lord to have mercy, and she sang and 
prayed with her sister, for she knew the Lord would hear and 
answer prayer. She had prevailed with God in prayer for her 
other sisters. She called in a few of the neighbors to sing and 
pray with her for the conversion of her sister. They had a good 
meeting, and when Martha was in earnest prayer the neighbors 
returned home. Our subject continued praying for her sister 
for several days and nights, and one day while she was singing 
one of her favorite hymns Martha was earnestly pleading with 
the Lord to have mercy upon her and forgive her of all her 
sins. Our subject continued singing the hymn and suddenly 
Martha let go of all the things of time and by faith took hold 
of the promise of God, which says: “Thy sins which are many 
are all forgiven thee.” She felt that the great burden of sin 
<pb id="mccmary39" n="39"/>
had rolled away and her soul was filled with light, peace, joy 
and gladness. She said in a loud voice: “O, praise the Lord 
for the joy and peace which now fills my soul.” Her father 
said, “Francis you are getting that girl excited,” but Martha 
said, “O, no, father, I am not excited, the Lord has forgiven 
me of my sins.” Our subject and Martha then had a good time
praising the Lord. Martha only lived a short time afterward, 
but she spent most of the time exhorting and warning others 
not to do as she had done. She died in full faith, and went 
sweeping through the open gate into that eternal city. But she 
went empty handed, as thousands of other people are going 
every day. The writer warns the reader, “Do not wait for tomorrow, ”for the Lord says: “Behold this day is the day of 
salvation.” Our subject was now more than ever encouraged 
to press on in the Christian life, so helpful in the presence of 
sickness and death.</p>

          <p>There was a great revival in the neighborhood, and all the 
churches and the three churches in the vicinity united in
union meetings. Meetings were held first in the A. M. E. 
and then in the Baptist church. The meeting commenced in 
<date value="11-1866">November, 1866</date> and closed in <date value="06-1867">June, 1867.</date> It was the greatest 
<pb id="mccmary40" n="40"/>
revival ever held in that part of the State of Ohio, before or 
since that time. A great number were converted during the 
continuation of the meeting, and many were called to preach 
the gospel. Some people who did not take part in the meeting 
predicted that the corn crop would be small, because the greater 
number of the people were constant in their attendance at 
the meeting. But, to their astonishment, there were better 
crops that year than ever before. The writer adds: “When 
people serve the Lord everything goes well.”</p>

          <p>The writer became acquainted with the Taylor family in the
year 1865. In the fall of that year I came home from the army 
to Cincinnati, then my home, and became acquainted with 
three of the sisters, two of whom were single, the other being 
married. The married sister lived in the same house where I 
was stopping. The family with whom I was boarding occupying 
a portion of the house. The two single sisters came to visit 
with their married sister. The younger of the unmarried 
sisters I only met a few times, but myself and the other two 
soon became great friends. At that time I had no thought of 
getting married. But about six months after the younger of the 
sisters mentioned above had returned to her home in Mercer 
<pb id="mccmary41" n="41"/>county, I wrote her a letter, asking the privilege of writing to 
her as a friend, merely to pass away the time. She gave her 
consent and a correspondence was kept up for about nine 
months. During that time I sent her one of my pictures. I 
did not say anything about marrying, and in a short time we 
stopped writing to each other. I remained in Cincinnati for 
about one year, when my health became impaired by reason of 
attendance on a sick man. The doctor said that I had better 
go west. I waited for three months and not getting any better, 
in the spring of 1867, I went to the southwestern part of Michigan. 
I left Cincinnati on the first day of April and arrived at 
Cassapolis next day. I had to go about eight miles into the 
country to the home of an old army friend, where I was kindly 
welcomed. We were both very glad to meet again. Good 
farm hands were worth from  $ 20 to $ 25 per month, but I was 
not experienced in farm work. After having had a good visit, 
my old friend, Joseph Cross, said that he had bought forty 
acres of land in the woods, and that he had sold one hundred 
cords of wood to a man who owned a woolen mill near the west
end of his land. He said he would give me work of chopping
the wood if I cared to do so. I had done but little chopping, 
but he offered me eighty-seven and a half cents per cord, and I 
accepted his offer. I began the work about the middle of April 
and finished it the last of June. I remained in the neighborhood 
a few days afterwards and then took my departure for 
Chicago. I was not there long before hearing that the captain 
of my company was in the city. I hunted him up, and he was very 
glad to see me. I was there a week before securing any work. 
At length I secured a place to work in a livery stable. I did 
not like that kind of employment and only remained there two 
months, when I secured a place to work in a private family.</p>

          <p> My first letter of friendship to the subject of this sketch 
was dated <date value="1867-08-01">August 1st, 1867.</date> We had never seen each other,
but we continued to write during the entire time I remained in 
Chicago. In 1868 I left Chicago and went to Mendota, Ill., 
where an old army comrade lived, whom I had not seen since 
we were mustered out of the service at Detroit in <date value="1865-10">October, 
1865.</date> I visited with him until March, and when the spring 
work began to open up, my friend Hunter said he would assist 
me in finding some work. Hearing of a lady by the name of 
Mrs. Dr. Tud, who owned a farm about one mile out of the 
city, and that she wished to hire a man to work for nine 
months, Mr. Hunter went to see her with me. I was fortunate 
in securing the position for nine months at twenty dollars a 
month. I commenced work on the <date value="1866-03-15">15th of March</date> and worked 
until <date value="1867-10-15">October 15th,</date> at which time my contract expired. She 
paid me and I then made my home at an aunt of Mr. Hunter's. 
She had no children, was a good Christian woman, and I had a 
nice home with her. Her husband was not a Christian, and 
neither was I, though I had not many bad habits, such as 
drinking strong drinks, swearing, smoking cigars, chewing tobacco, 
and keeping company with vile young people. But after 
all I knew I was a sinner and in order to become a Christian I 
<pb id="mccmary43" n="43"/>
must be converted. The Bible says every one must be born 
again, or they cannot enter the Kingdom of God.</p>
          <p>The woman with whom I was boarding was a great help to 
me. Before I had seen her she had written Christian letters to 
Mr. Hunter and myself, while we were together in the same 
company on the field of battle and sleeping together in the
same tent. I then began to think that I ought to become a 
Christian. There were only thirty or forty colored people, of 
whom part were Methodists and part Baptists. The latter had 
a house of worship, while the Methodists met in a little school 
house. In the early part of <date value="1868-01">January, 1868,</date> the Methodists 
held a revival in their regular<sic corr="place" resp="NS">plaee</sic> of meeting -- the school 
house. They invited the Baptists to come in with them and 
hold union meetings. The meetings were held two weeks, with 
only one conversion. I was the one convert, for I had been 
seeking religion for a long time before their meeting began. I 
shall praise through all eternity for the pardon of my sins. I 
had a terrible struggle to get loose from the devil, because I 
was so full of unbelief, but one mighty look by faith to the 
all-atoning blood of Jesus, and the power of sin was broken 
and my captive soul set free. Oh! what joy and peace and 
gladness filled my soul. I know what it is to have the light of 
God in my soul. Before I was converted I did not know anything 
about the Bible, and I could not read it. I began the 
Christian life without any knowledge of reading God's word. 
My great desire was to have a Bible and learn to read it. I 
went to see Mrs. Tud, and told her what the Lord had done for 
me and how glad I would be to learn to read the Bible. She 
said she was a member of the Bible society, and she would give 
me a Bible. She gave me a large sized one, and I began to 
<pb id="mccmary44" n="44"/>
spell the words and read as well as I could as I advanced in 
Christian life. I became more and more hungry for Bible 
knowledge. I can truly say it was a wonder to me how the 
Lord helped me and opened my understanding to read His 
blessed word.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">COURTSHIP AND MARRIAGE.</head>
          <p>My first letter of courtship to our subject was accepted. 
Our marriage was very strange indeed, and a surprise to both 
of us. There had been but little courting, and that had been 
done by correspondence. There was no positive engagement, 
nor was there any date fixed for our marriage. I do say to the 
readers of this narrative, who believe in the Lord and His guidance 
and who love and serve Him in all things, that the hand 
of the Lord was in this marriage. I wrote my last letter to 
her, stating that I would be at home in the fall, according to 
my promise. I left Mendota in October on the C., B &amp; Q. 
railroad. I arrived in Chicago and remained there twenty-four 
hours, leaving there on the Michigan Central railroad for Detroit. 
From there I went to Toledo and then to Lima, where 
I found the two sisters I had met four years previously while 
<pb id="mccmary45" n="45"/>
they were living in Cincinnati. The next day I wrote a 
a few lines to our subject, stating that I was in Lima and 
would wait to hear from her before leaving. In two weeks I 
received a letter from her saying that she would send a friend 
to meet me at New Bremen, providing I would write and let her 
know what day I would leave Lima. As soon as I received the 
letter I read and answered it at once, telling her on what day 
I would leave. In a day or two I began to prepare to start, 
and on the 16th day of November, late in the afternoon, I arrived 
in New Bremen. The friend was there to meet me. He 
introduced himself as Mr. Clark, and told me he had twelve 
miles to drive. I told him I had a trunk at the hotel. Hitching 
his horse to the wagon he drove after it. It was about four 
o'clock before we started. Mr. Clark had a good team of horses 
and by half past seven we were at his home. Mr. Clark's 
grandson took charge of the team and we went to into the
house, where arrangements had been made for me to stay over 
night. Mr. and Mrs. Clark were our subject's best friends in 
the neighborhood. After a good night's rest and a good breakfast 
and dinner the next day we started for the home of our 
subject, which was a mile distant. When we arrived our subject 
was not at home. She was just across the field at her 
aunt's, but saw us coming and returned at once. Mr. Clark 
introduced me to her, for it was the first time I had seen 
her. I had not even seen her picture, but she had seen one of 
mine. Mr. Clark returned to his home and we spent a pleasant 
afternoon together. Toward the close I asked her a direct 
question -- was she ready to marry me? She said yes. I asked 
her when and she said, “ to-morrow night.” She said that Mr. 
Clark would take me to Celina to get the license. I bade her
<pb id="mccmary46" n="46"/>
good afternoon. As I left the house I met her father and 
introduced myself to him. He said he had heard his children 
talking about me. I asked him about marrying his daughter. 
He said he had no objections, so that everything was all right. 
Early next morning Mr. Clark started for Celina, accompanied 
by myself, to get the license.</p>
          <p>We returned late in the afternoon. The whole affair had 
been kept secret, none but Mr. Clark and his family knowing 
of it until we returned with the license, when several friends 
and neighbors were invited to attend the wedding. At about 
eight o'clock the same evening we were united in marriage. It 
was the greatest surprise that ever happened in that <sic corr="neighborhood" resp="NS">neigborhood.</sic> I wish to add that had I gone to see my wife every day 
for five years before our marriage I could not have succeeded in
getting a better one. Neither would an engagement of six 
months duration added to her good qualities. Were she alive 
I feel sure she would make the <sic corr="same statement" resp="NS">samestatement</sic> regarding me as 
her husband. I can truly say that our married life was a happy 
one, as both of us were Christians - not formal church members, 
as are many of to-day who simply join the church without 
experiencing conversion. This was not so with us. My
wife was converted when she was about fifteen years old and 
my conversion occurred about a year before our marriage. 
Thus, we were prepared to make each other happy, not only in 
this life, but to help each other live the life of the righteous.
It has been said: “True happiness does not consist of the 
things on this world, but in the meek and quiet spirit which 
should dwell in the soul of every true Christian, which is true
happiness.” </p>

          <p>Mr. and Mrs. Clark gave us a very fine wedding supper. 
Mrs. Clark did the cooking, and she was an expert. A large 
number of guests were there, both married people and single. 
All who were invited came, and everything was favorable to a 
pleasant occasion. It was in the latter part of the month of 
November, and the evening was very nice, just cool enough to 
make it pleasant. All came early in order that a social talk 
might be had before supper. Of course the bride was the topic 
of conversation during the evening, although the groom came 
in for his full share. Mrs. Clark sent word that supper was 
ready, and as many as were required to fill the first table quickly 
responded. The bride and groom occupied seats of honor at 
the head of the table. The table was spread with everything 
good to eat, and plenty for all. Soon after supper many returned 
home, wishing the bride and groom all possible success 
in life. After all had returned we remained a short time with 
Mrs. Clark. About eleven o'clock we returned home, and the 
wedding festivities were at an end.</p>
          <p>We were soon to be left alone, as all of my wife's sisters 
had left home and her father was preparing to return to Kentucky. 
We talked and planned for the future, and debated 
whether it would be best to remain on the farm or not. Each 
<pb id="mccmary48" n="48"/>
of the sisters had equal shares in the farm, and the property 
was in bad condition. There was only one horse and it was 
not suitable for the work required, and there was very little 
else to do with. There was no grain for seed and a very little for 
bread. Only twenty-five acres of the farm had been cleared, 
and the only thing on the farm that gave any promise of prosperity 
were two <sic corr="milk" resp="NS">milch</sic> cows. There was no encouragement 
to remain. After considering everything I told my wife 
that it was useless to invest any money in the farm, for 
if we did we might have trouble with the other girls and 
their husbands, and that the best thing to do was to 
leave. She did not want to do this, but I insisted that 
it was the only thing for us to do, and then the matter 
was dropped. Often afterwards the question as to what was 
best to do came up for discussion. At last she said if a farm 
could be bought near Lima she would consent to go to it. I 
then wrote to her cousin at Lima to find out if there were any 
farms near Lima that could be rented, and soon received an 
answer that there was no farms to rent. That settled the 
question of renting a farm. All her neighbors constantly advised 
her not to move from the farm. I did not say any more 
concerning it for some time. Presently her two brother-in-
laws came to visit us. They said they had been told that there 
was a large amount of stuff on the farm, such as cattle, sheep, 
corn, wheat, fodder and hay, but she told them there was 
scarcely anything. They insisted on my wife telling them just 
what there was, and she did so, as follows: Two cows, ten 
bushels of corn, ten bushels of wheat, no oats, twelve shocks of 
fodder and two and one-half tons of hay. After she had made 
her report, the two men discussed it, and one told her it ought to 
<pb id="mccmary49" n="49"/>
be divided, but the other thought not, and the two men came 
very near quarreling over it. They remained with us for two 
days and one night, and then returned to their homes without 
having decided about the division of the farm. A few days 
after they had been gone my wife remarked to me that now it 
would be better for us to leave the farm, and we decided to remove 
to Lima. It was about the middle of January when the 
brother-in-laws came out to see us. In a short time we began 
to prepare to move to Lima. After everything had been packed 
we spent a week in making farewell visits to the neighbors. 
Everybody was sorry to see us go. On the 28th of February 
we started for Lima and arrived at our destination the same 
day.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 n="20" type="chapter">
          <head rend="capitalized">CHAPTER  XX.</head>
          <p>For a short time after our arrival in Lima we stopped with 
one of my wife's sisters, until we could find a suitable house to
rent. I soon found one that was located on the same street on 
which her sister lived. Asking the price of the house the 
owner said: “Five dollars per month.” I paid the money 
and he gave me the keys. We cleaned the house, moved in our 
goods, and in a few days were ready for housekeeping. We began 
at once to attend the A. M. E. church, and took an active 
<pb id="mccmary50" n="50"/>
part in all the services. In a short time the pastor gave an 
opportunity to those wishing to join the church to do so, and 
we united. At that time the church was in a dead and formal 
condition, and remained in that condition for several years. 
We were soon the leaders of the church and it did not increase 
numerically or spiritually until 1875, when the great revival 
reached Ohio.</p>
          <p>The first camp-meeting was held at Landsville, in the
State of Pennsylvania, in the year 1868, for the promotion of 
holiness, and from that meeting the revival of wonderful and 
complete salvation spread through the State of New York, 
Pennsylvania, and on west to Ohio and other Western states. 
The first holiness camp-meeting in Ohio was held at Urbana in 
the year 1874, and that was a wonderful meeting and from it 
the revival spread through many counties in Ohio, especially 
through Hancock, Champaign and Hardin. The first revival 
in Hancock county was held in <date value="1875-09">September, 1875.</date> The leader 
of this meeting was Mr. W. Ellis, and several came out into 
the glorious light of heart purity. In October of the same 
year another meeting was held in Ramsey chapel, six miles 
from Dunkirk, Ohio.  S. R., the leader, was assisted by W. 
M. R. Matthews, of Ada, Ohio. In  that meeting I heard the 
first doctrine of entire sanctification. This great blessing I 
was hungering and thirsting after for six months. I was under 
deep conviction for a pure heart, and I can truly say that I 
was not in a backsliding state, for I was walking in the light 
of justification, as God is in the light, and I was ready to enter 
into that glorious state of heart purity. Just after noon one 
day I had arrived from Lima to attend a quarterly meeting. 
After the business of the quarterly conference was over, Rev. 
<pb id="mccmary51" n="51"/>
Clark said to Brother S. S. Rice that he might proceed with 
the holiness meeting. Brother Rice then opened the meeting 
by singing the hymn:</p>
          <lg type="hymn">
            <l n="1">Oh! now I see the crimson wave,</l>
            <l n="2"> The fountain deep and wide,</l>
            <l n="3">My Lord, mighty to save,</l>
            <l n="4">Points to his crimson side.</l>
            <l n="5">Chorus.</l>
            <l n="6"> The cleansing stream I see, I see,</l>
            <l n="7">It cleanseth me, it cleanseth me,</l>
            <l n="8">O! praise the Lord, it cleanseth me,</l>
            <l n="9">It cleanseth me, it cleanseth me.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Brother Rice talked a few moments on how a believer 
may know whether his sins have been purified or not. Afterward 
he invited any one who wanted a pure heart to the altar. 
I was the first one to go forward, for I felt very much in need 
of a pure heart. Brother Rice was a great teacher. He was 
so simple in his manner of teaching a soul the way of faith. 
He was on the inside of the altar. Kneeling before me he 
asked if I believed the blood of Jesus cleanseth me from all 
sins now by faith. I could not answer him. He waited for a 
time and then asked me the same question again. My faith 
had taken hold of the promises of God, and I said, “I do believe 
that the blood of Jesus cleanseth from all sin.” As soon
as the words were out of my mouth I felt as though an electric
shock had passed over me. It went through every avenue of
my soul, purifying my heart from all sin. There was a voice
in my soul saying: “Peace, peace, peace.” I was blessed
many times. This was the blessing that the apostles received
<pb id="mccmary52" n="52"/>
on the day of Pentecost, when they were all filled with the 
peace that passed all understanding. It was as great a blessing 
to me as was my first conversion, seven years before. On 
Monday morning I returned home,  where I arrived at eight 
o'clock in the morning. As I stepped on the porch my wife 
saw there was a great change in my countenance, and asked: 
“What is the matter?” I replied that I had received a great 
blessing. She  asked, “What blessing?” That which prepares 
us for death, I answered, not knowing what else to say. She 
exclaimed:  “Oh, Mack,” as she always called me, “that is 
the very thing I want.” I then told her that Brother Clark, 
the pastor, was going to have the holiness people come to Lima 
and hold meetings in our church. She asked me when, and I
answered, about the 15th of October.</p>

          <p> Brother Rice, of Ada, and Brother E. E. Burlesson, of 
Cleveland, were leaders of the meeting. A large number of 
holiness people were in  attendance from Cleveland, Berea, and 
other cities in Ohio, and many came from the State of Indiana. 
It was a great surprise to the colored people. The pastor
<pb id="mccmary53" n="53"/>
 announced that there would be a large crowd of people at 
the meeting, and he wanted as many as could to prepare to 
take care of some of the visitors. The people came and were 
surprised that the meeting was to be held in the colored church, 
and the colored people were surprised to know that all the
people who were coming to the meeting were white. But 
nevertheless, when the people came they were taken care of by 
the colored people. They were not such as the colored
people were wont to call <soCalled rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo">“white trash,”</soCalled> but were people of 
rank. Some were encouraged in the meeting. They were not 
all old people, but many young men and women were among 
them.</p>
          <p>S. S. Rice was talking on the subject of holiness with my 
wife at supper one evening. She was under deep conviction, 
but she did not say very much to Mr. Rice. He asked her to 
come to the meeting, and she promised to do so. The meeting 
opened with wondrous power and some few came to the altar 
that night. My wife was the first to come. The  meeting was 
well attended by numbers from all the churches in the city.  
Sanctification was preached in that meeting by those who had  
experimental knowledge of holiness. The meeting lasted ten 
days. It was a grand meeting. About thirty claimed to have 
received help and nineteen professed to have received the blessing.  
At the close of the meeting a holiness band was organized 
in the church and nineteen joined it. My wife was the 
first one to come out in the experience of heart purity. She 
did not get the witness of the spirit at that time, but claimed 
the blessing of a pure heart of faith. </p>
          <p>Holiness bands were organized in several cities and towns 
in Ohio, and in other states. One morning while my wife  
<pb id="mccmary54" n="54"/>
was busy getting breakfast I was reading aloud from the 
<rs rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo" type="periodical">Christian Harvester,</rs> published at Cleveland, some of the 
testimonies given in these holiness meetings. One sister said 
that all the Lord wanted us to do was to fully believe. When 
my wife heard that statement it came to her with great power. 
She stepped out of the kitchen into the pantry, threw up her 
hands and said, “Yes, Lord, I do fully believe.” She was filled 
with the Holy Ghost, and from that day she began to prosper.</p>
          <p>The first band meeting was well attended, nearly all the 
members being present. I was appointed leader of the band. 
Some were seeking at every meeting. The meetings were held
on Tuesday evenings and every Sunday afternoon. It was not 
long before some of the church members began to find fault, 
saying that we were having too many meetings. Some opposed 
the Sunday meetings, claiming to be opposed to keeping the 
young people in meeting Sunday afternoons. Finally the opposition 
became so strong against the afternoon meetings that 
we discontinued them. The opposition kept up until nearly all 
ceased to attend the meetings, and within a year from the time 
of the organization of the band there were only six or eight remaining 
faithful. About that time it looked very dark for the 
continuation of the meetings. The opposition on the part of 
some of the church members was so great that my wife said 
she felt impelled to hold cottage prayer meetings every Friday 
afternoon. I told her that she had better consult with the 
pastor. Two or three days afterward she called on him and 
was told that her plan met with his approval, and he would 
appoint her the leader. The next Sabbath the pastor gave 
notice that there would be a prayer meeting on Friday afternoon, 
and that Sister McCray had been appointed leader. It  
<pb id="mccmary55" n="55"/>
was her first experience at leading a meeting but she was wonderfully 
helped by the Lord in her effort at leading. The 
meetings were thus carried on all summer. Some of the members 
would say to her: “Sister McCray, it is too warm to have 
meeting,” but she invariably answered them by saying that it 
is not too warm to die. We still held the Tuesday night band 
meeting. Sometimes the attendance would be small, but we 
did not get discouraged. We still called upon the Lord to pour 
out His spirit on the church. The Lord wonderfully answered 
prayer. In the month of <date value="1876-12">December, 1876,</date> the revival meeting 
commenced in the church. It lasted three months and was the 
greatest meeting ever held in Lima. Many people from the 
country attended the meeting. Some of the hard hearted sinners 
were converted and the church was in a good spiritual 
condition for a long time, as a result of that meeting. The 
church had been heavily in debt for several years, but in one 
and one-half years after the meeting the church was cleared 
and was free from debt, and with from $ 60 to $ 75 in the 
treasury. Everything moved along nicely. </p>

          <head rend="capitalized">OUR HOME IN DAKOTA.</head>
          <p>In 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1883 there was a great excitement 
about our moving to Dakota. Land agents out west were distributing <sic>circulars</sic> all over the east inviting all old soldiers and
sailors to come west and take government land. Soldiers were 
to have their choice of the land. A nephew of my wife had 
read one of the circulars. He came to our house and talked to 
my wife about it. He asked her if I was a soldier, and she 
said yes. He then said that all soldiers, sailors and old citizens 
could go out west and take up land. He said: “Perhaps your 
husband would go out there and take up some of the land.” When 
I came home she told me all about it, and said I had better go 
and learn something concerning it. She said she would have 
Johnnie come to the house and tell me all about it and to this 
I consented. In a day or two Johnnie came and told me all 
about the matter. After he left I told my wife that I thought 
it would be very nice to get some land for the boys, but nothing 
more was said about it for some time. Presently the subject 
came up again and we discussed it for six months or more 
before we could arrive at a conclusion. It was the opinion of my
wife all the time that I would go. At length I received a bundle 
<pb id="mccmary57" n="57"/>
of <sic>circulars</sic> from a land agent at Desmet, Dakota. I took them 
home and read them carefully. I then asked my wife what she 
thought about it. She answered that she thought it best to go. 
We had no choice as to what place to go, so in a few days I 
wrote a letter to Desmet, addressed to W. E. Whiting, the 
register of deeds of Kingsbury county. This was in <date value="1881-10">October, 
1881.</date> Within three weeks I received a reply from Mr. Whiting, 
giving a full <sic>discription</sic> of that part of Dakota. After reading 
the letter it was fully decided by both that I should go, but 
my wife did not want me to go alone. I tried to find some 
one to go along, but was unsuccessful, so on the <date value="1882-06-12">12th day of June, 
1882,</date> I left Lima and arrived in Desmet on the <date value="1882-06-14">14th of the same 
month.</date> On the <date value="1882-06-19">19th</date> I went out and selected 160 acres and 
sent in my papers to the land office at Watertown. I soon received 
my title to the land and hired a man to break ten acres 
for me, in compliance with the homestead laws. I also built a 
shanty and made it my home all that summer. During the 
first week in October I started back to Ohio. I stopped a few 
days in Chicago and arrived in Lima on the <date value="1882-10-17">17th</date> of the month.</p>
          <p>For the first five months of my stay in Dakota I had no intention 
of moving there, but I was delighted with the country, 
and told my wife that we should sell out and remove there. 
My wife said it was not best to sell our property, but I insisted
that it was not best to leave our property in Lima unsold. 
Nothing more was said for some time, but the subject came up 
again, and after discussion we decided to sell. Our eldest son 
was in Vernon, Mich., and we wrote to him that we were going 
to move to Dakota. He answered us and said that we had 
better not move. We wrote again, saying that we wished to 
see him before we started, and he came at once. My wife said 
<pb id="mccmary58" n="58"/>
that if Ed would only go with us everything would be all right. 
When Ed arrived he saw that we were getting ready to move, 
and asked us if that was our intention. His mother answered 
that it was, and added that it was desired that he go with us. 
After a few days of meditation he consented to go. Then I 
began to hunt some one to buy our property. Soon a man was  
found who offered me $1,200 for it, but something happened  
and made it impossible for him to get the money, and eventually 
I sold the property to another person for $1,000 cash. 
The deed was made out, the  money paid and everything settled. 
This was in <date value="1883-01">January, 1883.</date> I began to buy stock, such as 
horses, hogs, cattle and chickens, and a wagon. We had 
enough to fill a car. Another family by the name of Williams 
was preparing to go with us. We went to the P. F. W. &amp; C. 
Railroad  company to see about getting two cars from the Chicago 
&amp; Northwestern railroad, and they were forwarded to Lima 
at once. On Monday morning, <date value="1883-04-09">April 9, 1883,</date> we commenced 
to load our goods into the cars. We left for Dakota with one  
of the cars and Mr. Williams the other. We left our families 
at home until we reached Desmet. We were nine days on the  
road. At some point in Wisconsin we were delayed three days 
by reason of the roads being blockaded with trains of immigrants 
bound for Dakota from all parts of the United States,  
especially the eastern and northeastern states. We arrived in 
Desmet on the <date value="1883-05-09">ninth day of May,</date> with all our stock in good  
condition. We wrote for our families to come, and moved on 
our lands just as soon as we got temporary stables built for 
our cattle. Our families arrived and we had most of our goods 
on the farms. Mr. Williams' family arrived several days before  
my wife and children, as the latter stopped in Chicago for 
several days to visit relatives. </p>

          <head rend="capitalized">OUR HOME IN DAKOTA.</head>
          <p>Our first son was a barber by trade, so he stopped in Desmet 
and started a barber shop. Our farm was twelve miles 
from the same town, and it was very lonely with only three of 
us in the family. Our little boy was ten years old and had no 
playmates and no school to attend. The neighbors were few 
and scattering. As for my wife and I, we had no church to go  
to, no prayer or Sunday school to attend. We did not know 
any Christian people in the neighborhood. They had no 
thought for the Sabbath and hunted and fished as on any other 
day. They seemed to have left their God in their old home 
back East. But in the name of our God we erected our family 
altar night and morning, and looked to our God to find help 
to tell the story of the cross in our prairie home. Wife 
thought there must be some way to have meetings some place, 
and I told her that when we became acquainted with some of 
the neighbors we would find out if there were any Christians 
among them. The next day when I came to the house for dinner 
wife said that she had had a visitor that morning. I asked 
her if it was a man or woman and she answered that it was a 
man. She said that while she was at work in the garden she 
<pb id="mccmary60" n="60"/>
looked up and saw a man coming and waited to see if he would
stop at our house. He was singing a hymn, and my wife said
to herself that he must be a Christian. He came to the garden 
and said good morning, and asked how we liked the country.
My wife answered, very well, if we could only get acquainted.
He said, that's so. After they had talked for half an hour he
said that his errand was to borrow a hoe, if we had one. She
let him have it and before he left he asked us to come and
visit with them. He said that his name was Currier. My wife
told him we should call to see them in a short time. We called
and found him to be a Christian. His wife at one time had
also been a Christian, but bad backslidden. He had two married 
sons living on adjoining farms. The elder son was not a
Christian, but the wife of the younger son was a Christian
woman. There were about nine children in the three families,
aged from two to sixteen years. We had a good visit with
them. The summer passed very pleasantly but our hearts
were pained to see the wickedness among the people. The fall
work began and the neighbors were very kind to help us. When
the fall work was over there was nothing to do but to feed the
stock, and wife suggested that we go to Mr. Currier's and see if we
could not hold prayer meeting at his house. I agreed with her
suggestion and we made arrangements to go the next day. Mr.
Currier was well pleased with the idea and said he would go
and invite Mr. Morris and family. On Tuesday afternoon the 
first meeting was held, with the members of four families in
attendance. The meeting, the first one in that neighborhood,
was held in <date value="1884-01">January, 1884,</date> and was a blessed one. In the four
families represented in the meeting five persons were Christians, 
three women and two men. At the close of the meeting
<pb id="mccmary61" n="61"/>
we made arrangements to have another at the home of Mr.
Moore on the following Tuesday evening at the same hour. In
this way the meeting was carried on till the latter part of February, 
and all of us were greatly strengthened. Mr. Moore,
who had been a Christian, but had backslidden, was reclaimed
in the meeting, but did not stand true very long, as he fell back
into sin again when the meetings closed about the first of 
March, when spring work commenced. </p>
          <p>The first week in March was too stormy to commence the
sowing of seed for the wheat crop. One morning after my
little boy and myself had finished feeding the stock and milking 
the cows, we were all seated and talking over various affairs,
when Prince said: “Mamma, I wish there was a house somewhere 
in which school might be held.” The directors of the
township had said we might have school if we would furnish a
house to hold it in and find some one that could teach according 
to the law. No school houses had at that time been built
in that part of the country. Neither of us answered him for a 
moment, when wife said that she believed Mr. Hance Lee
would let the people have his house to hold school in. There
were three Norwegians, brothers, who lived next to us, their
farms joining ours on the north and south. The brothers all
lived in one house and the shanties on the other two claims
were vacant. Prince said he would go over and ask Mr. Hance
about using his house as a school, and his mother told him to
go. In a few moments he was back with the information that
the house could be had to hold school in. The next morning
the two brothers passed our house. I asked Mr. Hance about
the house and he said they might use it if there was any money
in it. Wife thought it would be well to go to speak to Mr.
<pb id="mccmary62" n="62"/>
Currier about the house and I went. He was very glad at the
prospects and said he would go and talk with the directors
about it. Those officials said it was all right, but there was no
money for rent, so it would be impossible to get a teacher.
The next thing to do was to find some one qualified to teach.
There was no single woman in the neighborhood, and only one
married woman that could teach. She was the mother of two
children, one aged four and the other two years. She was one
of Mr. Currier's daughters-in-law. They hardly knew how to
arrange it, but at last she told Mrs. Currier that if she would
take care of her children she would pay her for it. To this arrangement 
Mrs. Currier assented. Mr. Currier took Mary
down to the superintendent where she passed the examination
and received a legal certificate, to the joy and gladness of all
concerned. This was the first public school in that part of the
country. It commenced <date value="1884-03-01">March 1st, 1884,</date> and closed <date value="1884-07-01">the first
of July of the same year.</date></p>

          <head rend="capitalized">SUNDAY SCHOOL.</head>
          <p> In April we conceived the plan of having a Sunday school
some place in the neighborhood, and wife suggested that some
<pb id="mccmary63" n="63"/>
one might be found to open up their house for the school. We
talked the matter over with Mr. Currier's family. Then the
word was given out to all of the neighbors and all were in
favor of the Sunday school. Then the question arose, who
will open their house for it. At that time there was but one
house in the neighborhood large enough, and that was ours.
Mr. Currier suggested to some of the neighbors that Mr. McCray's 
house was the best place in which to hold the school, as
it was the largest. Then a discussion arose in regard to the
matter and some said they would not go if the Sunday school
was held in the house of a colored person. Others said that
made no difference and many pleasant things were said. The
Bible says that we must bear all things for Christ's sake and
not to find fault. Sinners and formal church members have
crucified Christ, as he has died for us. We had learned to
suffer all things for his name's sake. The subject of organizing 
a Sunday school came to a standstill in the neighborhood.
Opposition of this kind is what hindered the progress of the
black race in America for nearly two hundred years. They
were, and are now, hindered in every way because their faces
are black. The people in that neighborhood thought to hold
Sunday school in the house of a colored person was giving too
much honor to the race. It was the first Sunday school in that
part of the country. Many not only failed to come themselves,
but did all in their power to keep others away. But the people 
did not know that the Lord had something to do with having 
a Sunday school in that part of the country. We did not
want Sunday school held in our house, our only object was to
carry forward the work of the Lord, as He showed it to us.</p>
          <p> By this time the news had reached all through the neighborhood,
<pb id="mccmary64" n="64"/>
 and some people living southeast of us came to see
about it. Mr. Currier happened to be at our house at the same
time, and arrangements were made to organize the school at
our home. The next Sunday, according to arrangements made
then, the school was duly organized. The question again arose,
whose house shall we have the school in? Mrs. Booth said
many had objections to coming to Mr. McCray's to Sunday
school, but as for her family there was none whatever. Mr.
Cluett said the same thing. I said that I did not think it wise
to have the school at our house, but for the present it would be
better to hold it at Mr. Booth's, as their rooms are just as
large as ours. A vote was taken and carried to have it at Mr.
Booth's. The first session held in their home, five miles
south of our neighborhood, on the <date value="1884-05-13">13th of May, 1884.</date> The
school was carried on successfully during the entire summer.
The most of the attendance was from the neighborhood. That
was the Lord's way, not ours, and we gladly accepted it. “The
way of the Lord is not our way.” By having the Sunday school
at Mr. Booth's we were greatly blessed also in having preaching 
every two weeks by a preacher from Desmet. The school
closed on the <date value="1884-10-15">15th of October,</date> as the cold weather set in the
<date value="1884-11-10" certainty="uncertain">10th</date> or <date value="1884-11-15" certainty="uncertain">15th of November.</date></p>

          <head rend="capitalized">BUILDING PUBLIC HOUSES AND PLACES OF WORSHIP.</head>
          <p> When school stopped the people were greatly agitated for
six months. It was decided that each township should submit
propositions to the voters to build as many school houses as
were needed, at a cost of $700 each. The usual time for spring
election was on the second Monday in March, and the nominating 
conventions were held one month earlier. Notice was
given that the conventions would be on the <date value="1885-02-10">tenth day of February,</date> for the purpose of nominating the different officers. I
went to the convention and found most all the voters in the
township present. There was great discussion in regard to the
school house proposition. Some of the voters were not in favor
of building school houses at all. Others thought each district
should build its own house at a cost of $300 each, and others
were not in favor of holding religious meetings in the school
houses. One man said that for himself he did not believe in
religion, but he would not want his family to live in a neighborhood 
where there were no religious meetings held. The excitement 
run very high and the convention was called to a close
by the chairman. They proceeded in the nomination of officers. 
The balloting commenced, all the officers were placed in
nomination, and the convention was over. Between the convention 
and the election, a space of one month; those who opposed
<pb id="mccmary66" n="66"/>
 the building of the school houses did all in their power
to influence voters against the proposition. The election day
was on the <date value="1885-03-06">sixth of March,</date> and every voter was requested to be
at the polls to vote. The forenoon was very blustery, but I
went, and after I had voted remained about an hour to find out
about the votes cast in the morning. Several others remained
also. One man said that from the best information he could
gain all the votes cast were against the school house proposition, 
and I believed such to be the case. I returned home
down-hearted and discouraged, and as soon as I got into the
house my wife asked, “Well, Mack, how is the election?” I
replied that I was discouraged, and believed we would be defeated 
on the school house proposition. All the Christian
people were in favor of the building of school houses.
My wife said: “I have been praying all morning for the
proposition to carry, and I know the Lord will answer
my prayer.” I told her that most all the men who had
voted in the morning had cast their ballots against it,
but she answered that there would be enough votes
cast in the afternoon to carry the proposition. We did not
say any more about it. The next morning Mr. Currier came
along and in answer to our question said that the school house
proposition had carried by a small majority. My wife said:
“I told you that.” The school question was now settled, and
the county officials soon gave notice to the township officials
that there would be seven school houses built in the township
at once, and they were to be finished by the <date value="1885-11-01">first of November,</date>
so as to be ready for the winter term of school. The school
houses were planned, let to <sic corr="contractors" resp="NS">contrators</sic> at a cost at $700 each,
and were finished according to the contract.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE SUNDAY SCHOOL QUESTION.</head>
          <p>The question of Sunday schools came up in our neighborhood 
again. My wife said that Mr. Lee would allow the use of
his house for Sunday school purposes. The winter term of
school would be out the last of March and then the school
house would be vacant. I went to see Mr. Lee about the house
and he said he had no objections to people using his house in
which to hold Sunday school. Nothing more was said about
the matter until about the <date value="1885-05-01" certainty="uncertain">first of May,</date> when my wife suggested 
that we see Mr. Currier about the Sunday school. I was
nearly through putting in my spring crops. The next week I
went to Mr. Currier and told him about Mr. Lee's house. He
thought there would not be much trouble in organizing the
Sunday school, as several more families had moved into the
neighborhood since the spring of 1884. After we had talked
the matter over we decided to have all the people meet at Mr.
Lee's house on the second Sunday in <date value="1885-05">May.</date> Mr. Currier agreed
to tell as many as he could see and we did the same, and also
sent word to others. Within a week the entire neighborhood
had been notified, and on the day appointed for the meeting
there were from twelve to fifteen families present. A motion
<pb id="mccmary68" n="68"/>
was made that Mr. Currier preside over the meeting. Mr.
Alcock was elected superintendent, Mr. Grant Barton secretary, 
and Mr. Currier treasurer. Three teachers were also
selected. The school progressed from Sabbath to Sabbath,
with more new scholars at each session. They kept coming 
until the little house was too small. Something had
to be done to make room. All agreed that the house was too
small, and that it was too hot to stand outside. This was about
the <date value="1885-07" certainty="uncertain">first of July.</date> After the Sunday school had closed we went
home, and then my wife said that perhaps we could get a tent,
or some muslin to make one out of. We went to see Mr. and
Mrs. Currier to get their advice in the matter. They were going 
to Desmet the next day, and I said that probably my wife
could go along with them. They said they would be glad to
have her go. I went home and told my wife of the arrangement, 
and she said she would go. When they came along the
next day my wife was ready. They inquired about a tent, but
could find none. My wife said to Mrs. Currier that they would
go to Mr. Morris' store and see about getting some muslin.
As they entered the store Mr. Morris spoke to my wife, as he
was acquainted with us. They asked to see some cloth suitable
for making a tent, and he said the best thing he had was some
unbleached muslin, one and a half yards wide, which he thought
would be just the thing for tenting. The ladies said they
would take two bolts. My wife said to Mr. Morris that they
had no money to pay for it with, and he answered, “I can
charge it, Mrs. McCray.” To this she said all right. Their
next trip was to get four or five pieces of lumber twelve to
fourteen feet long, which they procured from a lumber yard
they passed when on the way home. By Sunday the tent was
<pb id="mccmary69" n="69"/>
ready to put up, and then there was plenty of room for all.
The school proved to be a great blessing to the neighborhood.
Many gave up their Sunday work in order to be present at the
school. Most of those who attended were Methodists, and
some one said that as so many were attending the Sunday
school it would be nice to get a preacher to come out and preach
to the people every two weeks. The proposition was talked
over by several, and one man said he was going to Desmet the
next week and he would see if he could find a minister that
would come out and preach every second Sunday. At the close
of Sunday school the superintendent announced that there
would be preaching immediately after the Sunday school and
invited all who could to stay. Nearly all remained. The
minister was there three times. After he had finished his discourse 
he asked all those who were Christians to let the fact be
known, and going through the audience he found that most all
those present belonged to some church. He announced that
he had found out that most all the people were Methodists, and
that if the people had no objections he would form a class, and
then they could have a class or prayer meeting every Sunday
after the close of Sunday school. After the Sunday school
closed the people accepted the offer to have prayer and class
meeting. The minister was a Methodist, and appointed leaders. 
The Sunday school, class and prayer meetings were continued 
all summer, but only a few attended and so the meeting 
and Sunday school closed <date value="1885-10-15">October 15, 1885.</date></p>

          <p>The school houses were now built <sic>and and</sic> we could hold

as distinctly as if a man had spoken them to her, and she said:
“I know it is the Lord that has called me to work, and I must
do it.”I tried to convince her that it was her own thoughts,
but she said no, that it was the voice of the Lord speaking to
her. I opposed her at first, but she did not say very much.
She was a wise woman in the things of the Lord, and knew the
call of the Lord better than I did, as she had received the call
before leaving Lima. The enemy, who has something with which
to oppose every one who is called of the Lord to work for the salvation 
of souls, tested her on every side. Her greatest trial
was that she had no education, and the enemy struck her
several hard blows by telling her that it would be impossible
for her to call sinners to repentance when she could neither
read nor write. The test was a hard one to overcome, but the
Lord was a present help in the time of need, and she called on
Him for aid. One day she was praying to the Lord about not
having an education, when words came <sic corr="to her" resp="NS">toher</sic> saying, “You lead
the people as I lead you.” She answered, “Yes, Lord, I will,”
and arose from her knees with the victory in her soul. It is
better to follow the Lord wherever He may lead you. The
<pb id="mccmary71" n="71"/>
Lord soon showed me that I did wrong in opposing her in the
work. The school houses were all numbered and named from
the farms on which they were located. I asked her one day in
which building she would hold her first meeting, and she
answered in Mr. Currier's school house, which was numbered
six. It was situated just one mile from our home. I also
asked her how soon she would begin, and she replied: “Just
as soon as we can give notice to the people.” She also asked
me to go to Mr. Currier's and tell them to send the word to all
the neighbors north of us. We could spread the news in the
other direction.</p>
          <p>The first meeting was held on the evening of <date value="1886-01-05">January 5th,
1886. </date>Not very many were present at the first meeting. It
was the first time that my wife had come before the people as a
preacher. The meeting was opened by singing the hymn:</p>
          <lg type="hymn">
            <l n="1">There is a fountain filled with blood,</l>
            <l n="2">Drawn from Emanuel's veins,</l>
            <l n="3">And sinners plunged beneath the flood,</l>
            <l n="4">Lose all their guilty stains.</l>
          </lg>
          <p> I had to lead the singing but the people did not help very
much at first. It was arranged after prayer that Mr. Currier
was to read a lesson. After this the speaker took for her text
the third verse of the eighteenth chapter of Matthew, which
reads as follows: “Verily I say unto you, unless ye be converted 
and become as little children ye cannot enter the<sic> Kingdow </sic>of Heaven.” She was wonderfully helped by the Lord to
preach the truth to the people. At the close of the meeting
she asked if there were any who desired to seek the Lord and
one or two answered yes. Several prayers were then offered
<pb id="mccmary72" n="72"/>
and the meeting was dismissed. She announced that there
would be meeting every night. It continued every night with
an increased attendance. On the third two or three came to
the altar and at the end of the week five had been converted.
By the middle of the second week the school house was nearly
filled, and the third week it was crowded. Many who did not
understand how a woman who was not educated could preach
the gospel came merely to witness the excitement. Mr. Alcock,
who was the best scholar in the neighborhood, said it was a
wonder to him; that he had never before seen a person who
could preach without being educated. <sic corr="one" resp="NS">One one</sic> old man, a
Southerner, said he did not have much love for the colored
people, but he became greatly agitated over the meeting and
said he would not attend because the niggers were at the head
of it. About two weeks before the meeting began he rebuked
Mr. Currier for helping on with it, and also for keeping company 
with us. He said he did not propose to keep company 
with niggers. He had at one time been a class leader in a
Methodist church. Wife and I heard of it but kept our counsels 
in regard to the matter. About the middle of the third
week two of the boys of the old Southerner came to the altar
and that brought him to the meeting. That night there was
not standing room in the house. After wife had finished
preaching she called for seekers to come forward to the altar,
and the same ones came forward. The third one had promised
the night before to come also, but for fear of his father, refrained 
from so doing. The audience was filled with seekers. 
Wife went back through the audience talking to the people.
Presently she saw the old Southerner, Lloyd by name, and said
to him: “Mr. Lloyd, please go forward and help the laborers
<pb id="mccmary73" n="73"/>
with their work.” He refused to go and when wife pressed
him for his reasons for not going he said he would rather not
give them.</p>
          <p>The meeting continued for three weeks, closing on Sunday
night at the end of the third week. About fifteen souls were
converted during the meeting, nearly all of them married people.
Among the converts were two or three young boys. At the
close of the service it was announced that there would be meetings 
the following Sunday morning and evening. On the Monday 
morning after the close of the revival meeting wife said to
me: “Mack, I want to go to Mr. Lloyd's this morning.” I
asked her reasons, and she said in regard to the trouble he had
had with our eldest son in regard to a land deal. Mr. Lloyd
had purchased 160 acres from our son, and claimed that he had
been cheated out of $75, and thought that we should return it
to him. Wife said that while she was praying the Lord impressed 
it upon her heart that we should go to Mr. Lloyd and
arrange the matter. I agreed to go. She then wanted me to
drive past Mr. Currier's, as she wished him to go with us. I
drove to Mr. Currier's house, but did not get out of the wagon.
Wife told him that she would like to have him go over to Mr.
Lloyd's with us, as we wished him to be present during the settlement 
of some business matters.</p>
          <p>He said he would go. He went to the house for his hat and
overcoat and in a moment was ready. We drove to Mr. Lloyd's
house. He met us at the door and invited us in. He assisted
us in putting the horse in the barn, and after we had returned
to the house and were all seated, my wife told him that we had
come over to find out what his objections were for not coming
to the altar a few evenings since to pray with the other seekers.
<pb id="mccmary74" n="74"/>
She told him if there was any fault on her part that she would
try to make it right. In answer Mr. Lloyd said that so far as
going forward to pray for seekers he was not in the proper condition. 
He then said: “Your son cheated me out of seventy-
five dollars and I think you ought to pay it.” I reminded him
that at the time the trade was made he knew my son was of
age and in business for himself, and that when he bought the
land he said nothing to us about it. My wife said that she did
not think it right for us to pay the money when we had nothing 
to do with making the deal. Mr. Lloyd answered that parents 
should help their children to make their wrongs right if
possible. I then said we would pay him if we were only able,
and he said he would be satisfied with fifty dollars. My wife
said that we had no money, but that our son had gone east and
as soon as we heard from him we would write and ask him to
help us raise the money, and it would be paid as soon as we
could secure enough money. Mr. Currier asked if that was
satisfactory, and Mr. Lloyd answered that it was. My wife
then said that we would have a word of prayer before going
home. We all kneeled down and my wife offered a special
prayer for Mr. Lloyd and his family. After we had arisen from
our knees we began to make preparations to go home, but Mr.
Lloyd said we must have dinner before we started, as it was
then about noon. His wife was a cripple, but she soon had
dinner ready, and we partook of the bounties of Mr. Lloyd,
who had said only two weeks before that he did not intend to
associate with niggers.</p>
          <p>After dinner we returned home, when my wife remarked
that she was well blessed in her visit to Mr. Lloyd's. I said
that I was very glad we went. She answered that she was very
			<pb id="mccmary75" n="75"/>
thankful to know that the Lord always makes men do the very
things they do not wish to. After that Mr. Lloyd had no objections 
to associating with colored people, and when the meetings 
were held in the school house a good audience was always
in attendance, and Mr. Lloyd and most of his family were there
at all the sessions. Soon arrangements were made to have
regular services in the school house every Sunday and prayer
meeting on Thursday evening.</p>

          <p>The place of holding the meetings was afterwards changed
to the Bartrum school house, which was three miles north of
our farm. There was a large class of Methodists in that
neighborhood. The meetings and Sunday school were well attended 
all through the summer and fall of <date value="1886">1886.</date> After Christmas 
it was decided to hold a revival service. The meetings
were held for one week, and then it was thought best to procure 
a preacher. At the close of the meeting several ladies
were standing together talking, when one turned to my wife
and said: “Mrs. McCray, what do you think about having a
preacher?” My wife said that if acceptable, she would lead
the meetings. They all looked at each other in surprise and
one said: “Mrs. McCray, you help us all right, but we think
<pb id="mccmary76" n="76"/>
it best to have a preacher.” My wife answered that she would
do the preaching for them, and they said nothing more. These
women were the leaders in the church, and one of them, Mrs.
Prath, was the wife of the leader of the class to which my wife
belonged. On their way home they stopped at Mr. Barthune's
house, which we all had to pass on the way home. Here they
held counsel as to what had better be done about a preacher.
My wife came up for discussion, and one said, “Mrs. McCray
is a good Christian woman, but she is colored and I do not
think it best for us to accept her offer to lead the meeting.”
Another suggested that as Mr. Prath was class leader it would
be best for him to take charge of the meeting until a preacher
could be secured. This course was decided upon and Mr. Prath
prepared to take charge of the meeting to be held the next Monday 
evening.</p>
          <p>The evening arrived and the house was crowded. After
singing and prayer Mr. Prath stepped into the pulpit and announced 
that as a minister could not be secured to lead the
meeting, the duty fell upon him. He promised to do the best
he could and asked all Christians to pray for him. His sermon, 
which was nothing more than such an essay as a school
boy would compose, written on paper. After talking about five
minutes, he began to read his essay. When about half through
he became mixed up, which caused some of the young people in
the audience to laugh. This confused him so that he at once
called upon some one to pray. The sermon was a complete
failure. His condition was like that of many who go forth to
call sinners to repentance. They are nothing more than dead,
formal church members, who know nothing of the saving
power of God. Sometimes the Lord stops them in their blindness,
<pb id="mccmary77" n="77"/>
 for we read in His holy word that if the blind lead the
blind they shall both fall into the ditch. The meeting continued 
for several nights, but Mr. Prath did not attempt to go
into the pulpit to speak again. The meeting closed with the
last of the week. The people wanted to choose their own
leader, and therefore, no one was lifted out of their dark and
sinful state.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">LOST IN A SNOW STORM.</head>
          <p> About the middle of <date value="1886-02">February, 1886,</date> after our son Prince
had gone to school, I had finished my chores and gone into the
house. I asked my wife if she would like to go over to Mr.
John Hackett's, as it was such a nice morning. She said that
she did not care to go then, but I answered that if we did not
go I did not know when we would have a chance again. After
thinking for a time she said that she did not care to go. I told
her that I was going, but did not like to go alone, and with this
went out to the barn. In a few moments I returned to the
house and found that she had decided to go along. I told her
to get ready while I hitched the horses and in a few moments
we were on our way. Mr. Hackett lived just one mile southeast
<pb id="mccmary78" n="78"/>
of our farm, and our horses had soon covered the distance.
As we drove up Mr. Hackett came to the door and invited us
in. My wife went into the house while Mr. Hackett assisted
me in unhitching the horses and putting them in the barn.
Going to the house we had a very pleasant visit for an hour
and a half, when I remarked that it was time for us to go home.
Mrs. Hackett insisted that we have dinner before we returned
and began at once to prepare the meal, and in a few moments
we were all seated around the table. Just as we were finishing
dinner, Mr. Hackett's brother, who lived only about twenty
rods away, entered the house. As he opened the door we could
see that it was storming. Mr. Hackett asked his brother if it
was much of a storm and he answered that it was, and rapidly
growing worse. He also said that it had been storming about
an hour. We had not noticed it as the windows were iced over
from the steam of the cooking. I went out to see how the
storm was and found it very bad and growing worse. We immediately 
made preparations to go home. I soon had the
horses hitched to the sleigh and driving up to the house my
wife took a seat beside me. There was plenty of straw in the
bottom of the sleigh and we had three or four blankets. Mr.
Hackett asked if I thought we would have any trouble in getting 
home. I told him that I did not anticipate any trouble,
as the tracks made by the sleigh when we came over were yet
visible. We bade them <sic>goodbye,</sic>and started the horses off
just as fast as they could go.</p>
          <p>It was one o'clock in the afternoon when we started, and
before we had gone far we discovered that we were in a terrible
storm. Soon we lost sight of the sleigh tracks. For a time
we kept on as we supposed straight ahead, but at last I stopped
<pb id="mccmary79" n="79"/>
the horses, and said to my wife that we were lost. She thought
not. The heavy storm and black clouds made it so dark that
we could scarcely see each other sitting as close as we were.
My wife then suggested that the horses be started and allowed
to take their own way. After we had thus wandered around
for some time I said that I did not think we were far from
home, but she thought we were three or four miles away.
Again the horses were allowed to take their own course, but
after they had walked for some time I stopped them and getting
out of the sleigh walked a few steps ahead of the horses and
found a place where the snow had been blown away and the
ground left bare. It was where some one had cut hay, and I
thought I could recognize it. I climbed into the sleigh and
started the horses. They were soon plunging through a terrible
big snow drift which they finally pulled through and were
again on the level plain. Then I stopped them again, and said
the Lord would have to deliver us from this storm. Wife said
she was praying for deliverance. I started the horses again.
Soon the clouds began to break and I could see some distance
ahead of the horses. Thinking I saw some weeds I started the
horses toward them. The horses plunged into a snow drift
again and soon were in the road where the wind had cleared
away the snow. As soon as the horses were in the road they
turned and went south, and had only gone a short distance
when I saw the top of a house. I said I believed it was our
house, and wife told me to drive up and we could get shelter,
even if it was not our own home. Arriving at the house we found
that my predictions were correct. Oh! what a wonderful time
of rejoicing over our deliverance from the storm. One of wife's
hands was frozen very badly. We did not see our little boy
<pb id="mccmary80" n="80"/>
Prince for three days. The third day he came home unharmed,
so we gave God the glory for his wonderful help in the time of
trouble.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE ORGANIZATION OF A FREE METHODIST CLASS.</head>
          <p>My wife became convinced that she was led by the Lord
to organize her work into a body. I asked her what she would
call it and she said she did not know until she had seen Mr.
Currier. He said he would not join any body except the Free
Methodists. We did not know anything about this denomination, 
but Mr. Currier had been converted at a Free Methodist
camp-meeting about three years before he came to Dakota. He
had formerly been a member of the Advents for over thirty
years, but after his conversion at the camp-meeting he did not
fellowship with them any more, though he did not join any
other organized body. His wife, who had also been converted
about a year later at a Free Methodist camp-meeting, wanted
to join that church but did not do so because Mr. Currier would
not join. Mr. Currier said that he considered the Free Methodists 
the best, as they did not admit members into church
fellowship until they were converted. They also taught holiness,
<pb id="mccmary81" n="81"/>
 and that the members should live pure and holy in the
present world. Wife said that was just the kind of a class she
wished to see organized and asked us to take a paper around
and ascertain the number that were willing to join such an organization. 
We found six, but as Mr. Currier did not decide to
join we let the matter rest for a time. Several days later Mr.
Currier was a caller at our home, and the subject of the class
came up again. After considerable solicitation on the part of
my wife he decided to put his name down as one of the members. 
This made seven on the roll, three men and four women.
Mr. Currier then said he would send to McCook county for a
Free <sic corr="Methodist" resp="NS">Methedist</sic> minister to come and organize the class. He
also wrote to Elder J. B. Freeland, chairman of the Iowa and
South Dakota conference of the Free Methodist church. Within 
two weeks he received an answer from Mr. Freeland, stating
that he would visit us on the <date value="1886-04-01">first of April.</date> He came and was
a guest at our home. He asked if it was the intention to organize 
a Free Methodist class, and my wife answered that she
had been led to organize the work into a body. He then said
that he did not know whether we could stand the rules of the
Free Methodist church or not, as they were very straight. Wife
asked him if they were any straighter than the Bible. He said
no, but that all churches did not hold their members to Bible
truths, as theirs did.</p>
          <p>Saturday night Mr. Freeland preached in the school house.
Sunday morning at ten o'clock he preached again. A large
crowd was present to hear him. He spoke with the power of
the Holy Ghost. And our souls were fed the bread of life.
After the sermon was ended a short speaking meeting was held,
after which he called those who wished to join the class forward.
<pb id="mccmary82" n="82"/>
He then asked if we had the witness that our sins were forgiven,
and all answered yes. His next question was, “Have you received 
the blessing of a pure heart since you were converted?”
Some answered that they had and others that they had not.
He then asked if they were seeking it, and all answered yes.
He said that all members of the class must give up tobacco,
ruffles, laces, ribbons, tucks, flowers, feathers, neckties, silks,
plug hats, and all kinds of secret societies, strong drinks, gold
and costly apparel.</p>
          <p>Wife and I had not received any teaching upon plain dress
so our clothes were very fashionable and worldly for the use of
holy people. Wife had to take several of her dresses to pieces
and to remove the trimming from others, but by so doing she
gained one or two dresses. Our hearts were prepared to receive 
the whole truth, and also to walk in the light that may
shine in our pathway. The Bible does not say anything about
fine clothes but it does say that we should not adorn our bodies
with gold or costly apparel. The writer knows from a blessed
experience that every one that hears the Holy Ghost teaching
on fashionable and worldly dress cannot become converted
until they are willing to give up their fine and fashionable
dress. The class was organized with Mr. John as leader. Wife
received license to preach <date value="1886-04-15">April 15th, 1886.</date></p>

          <head rend="capitalized">MEETING AT THE HALVERSON SCHOOL HOUSE</head>
          <p>Wife decided to hold meetings at the Halverson school
house, and on Sunday had the Sunday school superintendent announce 
that a meeting would be held there on the following Monday 
evening. On the opening night a good crowd was in attendance. 
The greater number of people in that neighborhood were
Norwegians and Swedes. The meeting opened with singing,
after which Mr. Currier read a short lesson from Luke's gospel. 
Wife took her text from the lesson read and had much
liberty and freedom in talking to the people. It was a good
meeting. At the close she announced that there would be
meeting every night and all were invited to attend, and also to
tell their neighbors. The attendance increased every night.
Soon wife asked that a mourner's bench might be prepared,
but Mr. Currier hesitated somewhat and asked her if she
thought there would be need of one. She said she thought
there would.</p>
          <p>The first night there was a little excitement in the back
part of the room. It was occasioned by a Norwegian who was
under deep conviction, but who did not know how to express
himself. So he broke out into loud laughter. After my wife
<pb id="mccmary84" n="84"/>was through preaching she went back to talk to him, but could
not make him understand. However, he kept on laughing.
The meeting continued all that week. On Saturday and Sunday 
nights there was not seeking room in the house. Sunday
night after my wife was through preaching she gave everyone
an opportunity to speak. A great many took part, and a large
number were under deep conviction, but did not come forward
to the altar. One woman and the Norwegian who laughed so
loud were converted. My wife announced that she was undecided 
as to whether the meeting should be held longer or not,
but announced that one would be held the next evening, when
it would be announced whether they would continue or not.
After the audience was dismissed two or three young men were
talking concerning the happenings of the evening, when one
spoke to an elderly man, named Durkey, standing near, and
said: “Mr. Durkey, they hit you pretty hard in the speaking
meeting to-night.” Mr. Durkey inquired as to what was said
and they told him various persons had spoken in regard to the
old men being converted. Such was the case, but there were
several old men in the meeting and the remarks had been made
in a general way and with reference to one in particular. However, 
it angered Mr. Durkey and he said he would stop the
meeting those niggers were running. The next morning he
saddled his horse and rode around to all the voters living in
that school district to get them to sign a protest against holding 
the meeting in the school house. He said we were burning
the oil that had been procured for use by the school, and
through his persuasion most of the voters in the district signed
the protest prepared by him. He then went to the director
and wanted the key, but the director told him he was in the
<pb id="mccmary85" n="85"/>wrong and would not let him have the key. Mr. Durkey insisted, 
however, that he would lock up the school house after
school was out. The director warned him that he should not
do so, but he went at once to the school house and arrived
there just as school was out and the children were fixing the
fire ready for the evening meeting. Taking the key from the
children he ordered them out of the building, put the chairs,
table and benches out on the platform, then locked the door
and put the key in his pocket.</p>
          <p>That evening my wife said that she wished to go to the
school house early, so we started about half-past five o'clock.
She stopped at Mr. Halverson's, while I went over to the
school house to get everything in readiness for the meeting.
Noticing the furniture outside the door and several children
standing near I asked what it meant. They answered that Mr.
Durkey had put them there but they did not know why he did
so, except that he did not want meetings held there any more.
I asked if Mr. Durkey had gone home, and they said he had
gone to Mr. Halverson's. Going to Mr. Halverson's I found
Mr. Durkey and asked him why he had locked the school house
door. He said that he did not intend for us to hold any more
meetings there and expose him before all the people. I asked
how we had exposed him, and he said by telling him he was an
old man and ought to be converted. After expostulating with
him for some time and finding he was firm in his decision that
there should be no meeting I told him he would at some time
be sorry for his action. We at once began to make preparations 
to return home. On our way we met several loads of
people coming and informed them that there would be no
meeting and told the reason why. All were very sorry. Mr.
<pb id="mccmary86" n="86"/>
Halverson said a few days afterward that a large crowd came,
some from eight or nine miles distant, and all condemned the
action of Mr. Durkey very much. He would not have locked
the school house door had he remembered the good book says:
“Whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in
me, it were better that a mill stone be hanged about his neck.”
The interruption of the meeting was the talk of the entire
neighborhood for several weeks.</p>
          <p>About three weeks later, about six o'clock one evening, a
stranger passed our house. He was a very rough looking man
and was poorly dressed. He did not stop at our house but
went to the next neighbor's and begged bread, until he came to
Mr. Durkey's house, which was the fourth one from ours.
There they gave him his supper and he went on his way rejoicing. 
After supper Mr. Durkey finished his work and after
reading for a time retired to his bed. He had safely locked his
barn and left everything in good shape. Between twelve and
one o'clock he was awakened by a strange noise, and going to
to the door saw that his barn was all in flames. When he and
his men reached the barn it was so far gone that nothing was
saved except one horse, and it was burned so badly that afterward 
it had to be shot. The family decided that the stranger
had fired the barn but he was never heard of again. Next
morning people came from many miles around to see the ruins.
Mr. Durkey confessed that he had done wrong in stopping the
meeting and all the people agreed with him. Afterward his
wife separated from him, his son left home, and he was left all
alone in his trouble. He believed that this had come upon him
because he had stopped the meeting. His whole family was
broken up and he lost everything he had. His farm was sold
<pb id="mccmary87" n="87"/>
and he came very near being killed with a horse so he had a
bitter experience in trying to interfere with the work of the
Lord.</p>

          <p> In <date value="1885">1885</date> and <date value="1886">1886</date> we lost part of our crops by <sic>drouth</sic> and
early frost. In <date value="1887">1887</date> we put in a larger crop than we had ever

cut our oats and five acres of wheat. The balance of the wheat
was not ready to cut and would not be for four or five days.
In the meantime a friend who had no binder asked us to come
over and cut his wheat and in return he would help harvest
ours when it was ready. We talked the matter over and concluded 
that I could go over and cut for him for two or three
days at least, and as our crop was very large his help in return
would serve us well. I went and was at his place three days
and nights. On the third day there came a heavy hail storm.
Our crop was directly in its path and was nearly all destroyed.
The following morning when I went home my wife met me and
said that she had been all over the farm and that there was but
<pb id="mccmary88" n="88"/>
little of the crops left. I told her that I did not know what
we should do as this was the third crop to be destroyed. I
went over the fields and it was a sorrowful sight to see such a
fine crop of wheat almost entirely whipped out by the storm.
I cut and cared for what was standing and from the wheat, oats
and all got about three hundred bushels. Our corn was nearly
all destroyed and our garden crops were almost pounded into
the ground by the hail.</p>
          <p>We submitted to it without a murmur or complaint. We
figured our debts and found they amounted to seven hundred
dollars, most all of which fell due that fall. What to do we
did not know, as we had no grain for seed and but very little
for bread, and could not borrow any more money. We did all
our fall plowing for the spring crops, but said little about our
troubles. One day in the latter part of <date value="1887-10">October</date> I was on my
way to Bancroft, a little town on the railroad about one and a
half miles from our farm, for the purpose of having my plow
sharpened, when an impression came to me that I must move
to Huron, where our oldest son was barbering. Huron was
thirty miles south of our farm, and the county seat of Beadle
county. It is located on the James river and at that time had
a population of about 3,100. After returning home I told wife
what had come to me and that the best thing we could do
would be to go to Huron. She asked if it was the intention to
sell the farm, and I told her that I had thought nothing
about that. She said she did not see how we could leave the
farm without selling it. I told her we would consider the
matter and do what we thought best for us. I talked with
several of the neighbors and all said we had better not leave
the farm. One day while in the county seat I asked a friend
<pb id="mccmary89" n="89"/>
of ours about the matter and he said we had better borrow seed
and keep our farm. I told him we could borrow no grain as
we had no money with which to procure other grain to pay
it back. When I returned home I told wife I thought it best
to sell everything on the farm except our house and furniture.
She wished time to think the matter over. In a few days Mr.
Currier came to our house and among other things told my
wife that she would regret the day we left the farm. In a day
or two afterwards she told me what Mr. Currier had said, but
I told her I could see no way out of our difficulty, except to
sell off our goods. She then said that I could do just as I
thought best, but that she wanted to retain one horse and a
cow. We then decided to leave the farm and move to Huron.
On the <date value="1888-02-15">15th of February, 1888,</date> I had the bills printed for a
public sale, to be held on the <date value="1888-03-07">7th of March.</date> The day of the
sale was a fair one and a large crowd was in attendance. The
sale commenced at ten o'clock in the morning and by three
o'clock in the afternoon everything had been sold. After our
debts had been paid we had nothing left but our household
goods. In ten days after the sale all business matters had been
arranged and on the <date value="1888-03-17">17th of March, 1888,</date> we arrived in Huron
and stopped with our married son for a few days before going
to housekeeping.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">OUR HOME IN HURON.</head>
          <p> There were six churches in the city, but Christianity was
nothing but a form. As we were members of the Free Methodist 
church we did not confine ourselves to any one of the
churches in the city but attended all. In the city we found
one or two colored families and eight or nine single persons.
My wife determined at length to ask Mrs. McDonald if we
might not have prayer meeting at her house, and she said she
would be very glad to have us to do so. She sent word to all
the colored people and the meeting was held during the first
week in <date value="1888-04">April.</date> Afterwards we held several prayer meetings at
the same place. Mrs. McDonald's husband was an old man,
about sixty-five or seventy years of age, and very wicked. He
was converted in one of our meetings. Others were under deep
conviction, but did not yield. Mrs. McDonald professed to be
a Christian, but she did not know anything about practical
Godliness  She was much worse than the younger people in
worldly form. Her husband died a year and a half after his
conversion.</p>
          <p>We held the prayer meeting only a short time, as they
were soon tired of attending regularly. We then attended the
<pb id="mccmary91" n="91"/>
class meeting at the Methodist church, which was held every
Sunday morning. Only a few of the older members attended
the class, and there was no life nor power in it, only dead form.
I attended the Sunday school, until a string band was brought
in to make music. Then it became a place for entertainment
of pride, and a show. This only serves to blind the minds of
the young, so that they do not know the true object of the Sunday 
school. It is very sad indeed to witness how far the present 
generation is drifting away from the simple method of
teaching to the children the way of eternal life. There is very
little hope for improvement in teaching when the teachers
themselves know very little or nothing about the way of eternal
life, either by experience or mental knowledge. They can not
impart that of which they have no knowledge themselves.
The Sunday school of this present time has become so worldly
that the children think of it only as a place to go to be amused
and show their fine clothes.</p>
          <p>The first revival meeting we attended in the Methodist
church was conducted by a young Evangelist whose home was
in Canada. H. H. Dresser was pastor of the church. The
young Evangelist was limited in educational attainments, but
after his conversion he had been called to preach. He led the
meetings two or three evenings, when the official members of
the church became very much displeased with him. The
officials were the well to do persons in the church, and it did
not please them to be told that they must be converted. They
complained to the pastor, saying that the Evangelist did not
come up to their ideas, and that it was for the best interests of
the church to close the meeting. This did not meet with the
approval of the pastor, who desired to give the young man
<pb id="mccmary92" n="92"/>
further trial, but the officers insisted that the meetings close.
The pastor knew that the persons who objected to the meetings
were the ones who contributed most liberally to the support of
the church, and, regretfully, he closed the meeting. The
Evangelist was given his pay, and allowed to go to other fields
where his work was more acceptable, and no souls were saved
that winter.</p>
          <p>In the fall of <date value="1889">1889</date> the conference sent Rev. H. H. Dresser
back to the church for the third successive year. Soon after
the holidays had passed the pastor called the official board of
the church together to make arrangements to hold revival
meetings. It was arranged that the meetings should be held
by the pastor himself, with the aid of the presiding elder and
ministers from other churches. The first meeting was held the
middle of <date value="1890-01">January</date> and there were meetings for three or four
weeks. Several ministers and the presiding elder came, but
could do no good, as the members were nearly all dead spiritually. 
The ministers themselves had little of the power of God
upon them, and therefore could not wake many of the members 
from their careless condition. The meetings closed. One
old man who had been a backslider for thirty or forty years,
was reclaimed. He joined the church without having been converted. 
So the best two years of Rev. Dresser's pastorate was
a failure, so far as the salvation of souls is concerned. What
was the cause of his failure? The answer is that, like most of
the preachers of the present day, he was preaching without the
power of the Holy Ghost and with a desire to please the rich
church members. It is very sad, indeed, to see Christian
churches drifting into this state, but, nevertheless, it is true,
and every true man and woman must admit it to be a fact.
<pb id="mccmary93" n="93"/>
The word of God says, “In the last days they shall wax worse
and worse deceiving and being deceived.” But our dear Lord
has always had a few in all ages that would not defile themselves 
with sin, thanks be unto our Lord, who giveth us the
victory over <sic corr="the world" resp="NS">theworld</sic>, the flesh and the devil, through our
Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.</p>
          <p> In the fall of <date value="1890">1890</date> conference sent a new minister to the
church. His name was F. G. Newhouse. He was heartily received 
by all the members, and proved himself a better preacher
than the former pastor. In the early part of <date value="1890-11">November</date> he
called the official board together to counsel in regard to holding 
a revival meeting. The officers told him it would be impossible 
to have a meeting at that time, as the whole city was
in a gambling scheme to have the state capital located there.
At the election held soon afterward the city lost the capital,
and with it two hundred thousand dollars that had been put
into the gambling scheme. As most all the rich church members 
were interested financially in the scheme they were very
sore and in no condition to go into a revival meeting, and the
pastor was very sorry that it was impossible for him to carry
on a meeting in which poor sinners might find their Savior.
John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, said it is not best to
make the rich man a necessity, but churches should be built
large and plain. Now, however, churches are constructed on
the most expensive plans. This necessitates a large revenue
and concessions are made to the rich in order to induce them
to join, and thus secure their monetary support. The result is
that soon everything is in their hands, and the church and
pastor are controlled to suit their selfish interests. There is no
time to work for the salvation of souls until the new church is
<pb id="mccmary94" n="94"/>
paid for, and then it becomes a place for parade and show.
The older members, who once enjoyed the life and power of
God in their souls, now are compelled to sit and look on.
This pride and show has become so popular that many of the
older members believe that this new order of things is all right.
What a sad condition the mass of the church members have
fallen into. There is no hope for many of them.</p>
          <p>In <date value="1891">1891</date> the rich members of the church became reconciled
to the loss of the capital, and in <date value="1891-01">January</date> consented to allow
the pastor to have a revival service. The services of Mrs.
Dennis, an evangelist of Goshen, Ind., was secured for three
weeks. She came and the meeting began at once. She was a
good preacher and the church was crowded every night. She
preached very strongly on the subject of conversion, and deeply
impressed many of the church members. Several asked what
it meant to be converted. One evening she preached on the
subject of conversion, and before her talk was ended many of
the members found that they had never been converted. She
also held several meetings for the special purpose of preaching
on the subject of holiness. In these meetings very few received 
any benefit, as few understood anything about conversion. 
The meeting closed, and the pastor stated that one
hundred and twenty-five had professed conversion. Nearly all
of them united with the church. Oh! how sad to see these
poor souls so deceived, knowing nothing about being born
again. The blood of the people will be required at the hands
of the watchman who does not warn them faithfully.</p>

          <p>Huron failed in her efforts to be created the capital of the
State of South Dakota, and this caused a large exodus of its
citizens to other places. Had Huron secured the capital there
would have been a great boom, but failing in this, great disappointment 
was caused. As we had lost everything, we concluded 
to move elsewhere, but could not decide as to our future 
location. My wife had two sisters living and did not wish
to move further away from them. I was undecided as to where
we should go, but both of us were determined to leave Huron.
Several days later I wrote to a friend in West Superior, a real
estate man who had gone there from Huron. He knew the
line of work I followed and wrote that West Superior was an
advantageous point for me. We talked the matter over several
times, and at last I proposed that my wife and Prince should
go to their old home in Ohio, while I would go to West Superior 
and have a home ready for them in the fall, at which
time they should join me. While my wife thought the arrangement 
a very good one, yet she did not assent to it, but
said she would consider it. A few days later, while I was
walking along the streets of Huron, the thought came rushing
<pb id="mccmary96" n="96"/>
into my mind as loud and clear as though some one had spoken
to me, that Lima was the best place for me to go to. I did not
tell my thoughts to my wife for several days, but it kept
recurring to my mind all the time. At length I told wife about
it. Her first inquiry was as to where the money would come
from to enable us to make the trip. I answered that the Lord
would open the way for me to earn the money. This was in
<date value="1891-02">February.</date> Wife said very little to me about it, as she did not
want to make Lima her home again. She prayed over the matter 
for several days, and at length became reconciled to the
fact that it was the will of the Lord that we should move back
to Lima. Afterward she told me that the Lord made it very
plain to her, revealing just what we were to do. While in
prayer she was told that our mission was to go back to Lima
and establish there the real work of Bible holiness, as a second
work of grace received in the heart of every one after their conversion. 
This had not been taught in Lima for six or seven
years. When we moved west in <date value="1883">1883</date> we left two bands of
holiness people, one in the Trinity M. E. church and the other
in the A. M. E. church. The former was held at the home of
Mrs. Hart, but after her death it ceased to meet, and the latter
also had disbanded. The subject of holiness, so far as organized 
bands were concerned, had ceased to be taught in Lima.</p>
          <p>We at once began the preparations for moving, selling a
great share of our household goods. By the second week in
<date value="1891-04">April</date> we were ready to make the start, and on the fifteenth
day of that month we were on our way back to Ohio. We
stopped and visited with an old friend for about two weeks and
arrived in Lima the latter part of the month.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">LIMA AGAIN OUR HOME.</head>
          <p>We arrived in Lima via the C. &amp; E. railroad on the <date value="1891-04-29">29th
of April, 1891.</date> During our eight years of absence we found
that many changes had taken place. The oil industry had increased 
the population, and instead of the village we had left
we found a city. We were made to feel very sad that Christianity 
had fallen into such a low state. We attended the A.
M. E. church, with which we had formerly been connected, the
first Sunday after our arrival, and were very much surprised to
see the small congregation at the morning service. After
preaching, class meeting was held, but we soon saw that the
strong power that had reigned supreme formerly had been
blotted out. We attended this church all summer, excepting
during three weeks when we were visiting in Kentucky, Louisville 
and Goshen, the former being the place where my wife
was born and raised.</p>
          <p>After an absence of thirty years she had an opportunity of
seeing once more the log house in which she was born. We
walked about the plantation and saw many places where she
played in her childhood days. We went down to the old graveyard 
where her only brother and two of her sisters were buried,
<pb id="mccmary98" n="98"/>
and also visited the grave of her former mistress. The old
plantation had not been worked for many years and had grown
up into bushes and weeds. We found a number of the old
fruit trees, still bearing, and gathered a few peaches and pears
to take home with us. We met some of the old residents, who
were living the same as in days of old. Some who had been
children with her, and many of her relatives were yet living in
the neighborhood.</p>
          <p>Our visit to Kentucky was a very pleasant one indeed.
The boat in which we made the trip from Cincinnati to Louisville 
was one of the largest that traversed the Ohio river. The
ride was a delightful one. We had the privilege of eating two
meals on the boat, supper and breakfast. The state room in
which we spent the night was nicely furnished. The thirty
years that had elapsed since my wife came on a boat to Cincinnati 
had wrought a great change. Then colored people
were not allowed in the cabin, but were compelled to sleep
among the horses and cattle. Only as servants to white passengers 
were they allowed to enter the cabin. That spirit has
not yet all passed away but is more noticeable in some places
than others. After visiting for three weeks we started for home
over the same route we had taken in coming. We left Louisville 
at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, but owing to a heavy peach
crop and numberless stops to take the fruit on board, we were
five hours late in arriving at Cincinnati. From there we took
the C. H. &amp; D. railroad for Lima, where we arrived at <time value="0830" type="am">8:30
a. m.</time></p>
          <p>We had been stopping with Mrs. A. Byrd, my wife's
sister, but in a few days we moved into a new house on South
Baxter street, and in a short time were housekeeping again.
<pb id="mccmary99" n="99"/>
My wife then suggested that it would be well to hold a few cottage 
prayer meetings. I heartily approved of her plan, as so
few attended the regular prayer meetings at the church. The
first meeting was held at our house, and only a few were there.
The next meeting was held at her sisters and no one came.
Then one was held on Spring street, with the same result. On
our return home from this meeting my wife asked me what I
thought of it. I answered that the people did not care for
praying, nor did they care to attend a meeting appointed for
prayer. We finally gave up cottage prayer meetings, but
regularly attended those held at the church. These were
gradually losing all interest. The pastor would open the doors
of the church for members every Sunday, but we thought it
best not to join. At length I decided to have a talk with the
pastor on the subject of holiness, which was our theme with
all men, for without holiness of heart no man shall see the
Lord. One Sunday afternoon I spent a few hours with the
pastor discussing different subjects in the Bible. He did not
know anything about holiness, as experience meant knowledge.
He believed that a person would grow better and better, and
just before death the Lord would make them holy. The word
of God says: “I am not the God of the dead, but of the living.” According to this, then, all the blessings that God has
promised to men are in the present time. They do not mean
to-morrow, or the next day, nor just before we die, but to-day.
The word says: “Behold this day is the day of salvation.”
If any man hears the voice of God calling him to repentance
the heart should not be hardened, as it may be the last call.
Finally, I said to the pastor that I would not join the church
just then, but would wait on the Lord. He thought that the
best thing to do, and nothing more was said. We continued
attending the church until the fall of <date value="1891">1891.</date></p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE FIRST HOLINESS MEETING IN LIMA,
OHIO.</head>
          <p>One day in <date value="1891-11">November,</date>while we were talking about the
spiritual condition of the city, wife proposed that a letter be
written to Brother Thomas K. Doty, of Cleveland, inviting
him to come or send <sic>some one</sic> to hold a series of meetings outside 
of any church. Mr. Doty was editor of the <rs type="periodical">Christian
Harvester,</rs> published at Cleveland, and a personal friend of
ours. The invitation was sent and in reply he told us to write
to Rev. Hiram Archers, of Big Pines, Ohio. We did so and he
sent us Testimony Stewart, of Bellefontaine, her son Elmer,
Mrs. Dunmire, of Bucyrus, and W. E. Williams, of Versailles,
O. Mrs. Stewart was leader of the meetings. The rest came
as assistants. Our first meeting was held <date value="1892-11-15">November 15, 1892,</date>
in the teacher's examination room in the court house. As this
was too noisy a place we only met there a few times. A room
in the old street car barn which had been arranged for mission
work was then occupied. The members of the mission only
allowed us to meet there one night. The next place of meeting 
was in an old vacant house on West Spring street, which
was very much torn up. The owner agreed to rent it to us for     
<pb id="mccmary101" n="101"/>
five dollars a month, and we accepted the offer. We had no
money to pay the first month's rent, neither had we enough
to furnish it with heat and light. We did not know what to do.
We knew that the Lord had led us thus far, and we also knew
that it was the will of the Lord that the meetings should continue 
until His whole truth was established in this city.</p>
          <p>As all four of the workers were stopping at my house, I
went to my work the following morning with a heavy burden
on my heart concerning the work. About <time value="0800" type="descriptive">eight o'clock</time> Mr.
Williams, one of the workers, came to me and asked if I was
well known in the city. I answered that I was. He then suggested 
that it would be a good idea to take a subscription paper
around among the business men and ask them to assist in
carrying on the work of the Lord. I told him that I did not
care to write up such a paper, so he agreed to do it, with the
understanding that myself and wife should sign it. When I
returned home in the evening he had the paper ready, and the
next day, Friday, I started out with it. I was undecided as to
whom I should approach first, but finally decided that the man
for whom I was working was the proper person. I handed him
the paper. He kindly read it over, approved of it, and handed
me a dollar to start with. By the evening of the following day
we had money enough to supply all our needs, and on Saturday 
evening had our first meeting in our church. We continued 
until the latter part of <date value="1893-01">January, 1893,</date> and at the close
seven of us organized ourselves into a holiness band. We held
regular services on Sunday, and prayer meeting on Wednesday
evening. We were instructed to send to J. S. Robinson, of
Union City, Ind., and ask him to take charge of the work. It
was stated that he would be a great help to us, as he was
<pb id="mccmary102" n="102"/>
preaching in the independent holiness line, and had been for
many years. As we were just starting out in that line we were
very much in need of a helper. In answer to our request he
said he would come and hold a ten day's meeting for us. The
date of his arrival was fixed for <date value="1893-03-10">March 10th.</date> At the close of
these meetings there was some talk of buying a lot and building
a church. We inquired into the matter and were told that if
we were organized into a body, according to the laws of the
state, we would be better prepared to buy real estate. We then
held a special meeting to organize ourselves into a church.
After some discussion as to a name, it was decided to call it
the First Holiness church of Lima, Ohio. This action was
taken on the <date value="1892-04-11">11th day of April, 1892.</date> The church was known
by this name until the evening of the <date value="1895-04-09">9th of April, 1895,</date> when
it was thought best to change the name, and a meeting was
called to take action. On motion the name, <rs rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo" type="church">First Holiness
Church of Lima</rs> was dropped and in its place was substituted
by proper action <rs rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo" type="church">The Mission Church of Christ.</rs> For some
the place of meeting had been in an old frame house on West
High street, but after the adoption of the new name we rented
Stamet's hall for our regular place of worship.</p>
          <p>In the name of the Lord we went forth in this city to do
the very best we could in advancing the practical truths of the
religion of the Bible. It must be confessed that our efforts
have been weak indeed, but knowing no better we could do no
better. Many things have hindered us from accomplishing all
that we desired to do. Without education, very few in numbers 
and poor in worldly goods, and without influence among
the masses of the church going people, they were not attracted
to our meetings, and thus our opportunity for doing good has
<pb id="mccmary103" n="103"/>been limited. In <sic>olden</sic> times the people had leaders who
taught in the temples, instructing their hearers in the various
forms and ceremonies. But when Jesus came into the temple
and found them buying and selling he turned over their money
tables and drove them out, on account of which they were ready
to stone Him and all His disciples. When we look back upon
what we have accomplished in our little work, which seems
very little in the sight of men, we are reminded that the Lord
has said: “To him that is faithful until death I will give a
crown of life.”We are conscious of the fact that we are working 
for the salvation of immortal souls in the manner that the
Lord would have us.</p>

          <p>About noon on the <date value="1894-06-15">15th of June, 1894,</date> the subject of this
sketch was taken very sick. When I arrived home for dinner
she said to me that her work was done, and that she was going
to die. She asked that the children be sent for. Our elder
son and his family were living in Wisconsin and our younger
son was at Wilberforce College. I told her that she was alarmed
at her condition and that she was not so sick as she thought.
<pb id="mccmary104" n="104"/>
But no argument of mine changed her opinion. I ate my
dinner and returned to my work, feeling very sad. As time
passed by she continued to grow worse, although she was able
to do her work and attend the meetings all summer. About
the middle of <date value="1894-09">September</date> she had grown so weak that she was
unable to do the heavier household duties, and a month later
was unable to do any work whatever. She was, however, able
to be up every day.</p>
          <p>On the <date value="1894-11-24">24th of November</date> I received a letter from C. S.
Hanley, editor of the <rs rend="PRE ldquo POST rdquo" type="serial">Fire Brand,</rs> a religious paper published 
at Shenandoah, Page county, Iowa. We were close
friends to him and his wife and had assisted them in conducting 
a training home and school for missionaries, and also in the
publication of the paper by donating money and such other
help as we were able to give. He wrote that they were about
to start to New York with a band of missionaries, who were
on their way to Africa. I succeeded in having them stop at
Dayton, Ohio, and hold meetings. We went to that city to be
present at the meetings, arriving on Wednesday, <date value="1894-11-20">November 20.</date>
The meeting was to begin the following Saturday. We met
Brother Hanley and his wife and the missionaries. The meetings 
were very enjoyable. There were eight missionaries, all
young men, the youngest being a boy of sixteen years. They
had given up father, mother, sister, brother and friends and all
comforts of home, that they might go to heathen lands to save
poor souls. Two of them had been born in India. They were
sent to this country by their father, after the death of their
mother, in order that they might be trained for missionaries.
They had been in the training school in Shenandoah for two
or three years and were now on their way home to India to

<sic corr="spend" resp="NS">pend</sic> their lives in missionary work. Surely the harvest fields
is great and the laborers few. Oh! may the Lord of the harvest 
send forth more laborers into fields already ripened for
the harvest.</p>
          <p>We spent two days and one night in Dayton and then returned 
home. My wife did not get any better, though she was
not confined to her bed until the day before she died. The
night before her death she was very sick and in the morning her
condition was alarming. I was at her bedside all the morning. 
About <time value="1000" type="descriptive">ten o'clock</time> she said to me: “Mack, are you not
going to take me up.” I answered, “No.” She then added:
“It is so very dark to-day.” About <time value="1100" type="24hour">11 o'clock</time> she said to
those about her: “I thank you all for your kindness. I am
so sleepy and will now go to sleep.” We left the room and I
said to Mrs. Fenwick, the nurse, that I would go and do some
work that was awaiting me. Giving directions where to find
me and instructions to send for me at once if any change for
the worse took place, I left the house. I had been gone only
fifteen or twenty minutes when she aroused and said: “Where's
Mack? He has not gone to work, has he?” She asked Mrs.
Fenwick and some other ladies who were present to assist her
into a chair. She was in the chair only a few moments when
she called for a drink of water. She said: “Oh? how sweet it
is to trust in Jesus.” The minister came in and said a few
words to her and then sang a hymn. She joined in the singing
and her voice was as strong as ever. The minister left the
room, but his wife remained. About <time value="1300" type="24hour">one o'clock</time> the sufferer
bowed her head. The minister's wife went to her side, lifted
her head, and found that the spirit had taken its flight.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Fenwick at once sent for me, but I arrived too late.
<pb id="mccmary106" n="106"/>
She had passed away from this world to the heavenly kingdom
prepared for her from the foundation of the world. I can truly
say that during her entire life almost, she had taken hold on
eternal life and had fought the good fight of faith. And
henceforth there is laid up for her a crown of life by Him who
has said: “Be thou faithful unto death and I will give thee
a crown of life.” She is gone forever to join the blood-washed
throng who have passed up through great tribulation, and
whose robes have been washed and made white as snow in the
blood of the Lamb.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized">THE TRAINING OF CHILDREN.</head>
          <p>This chapter has been written after much reflection and
prayer, yet the writer has never offered anything to the public
with such a deep sense of his inability to accomplish the work
according to his wishes. Never has he been more inclined to
accuse himself of presumption, in attempting a task beyond
his strength. In submitting this chapter to mothers a few
words of explanation might be given as to the object in writing 
it. The desire has been to give a little counsel to mothers
in various situations, such as a confidential friend might impart, 
with full knowledge of all the circumstances and bold
enough to speak the truth. Mothers should know many things
that are not touched on in sermons or in a general way, but
which affect the conduct of multitudes. The solemn warnings
given in the scriptures are not adhered to as they should be,
either by parents or children. The word of God says: “Train
up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will
not depart from it.” In these days of hurry and rush few
parents take the time to properly train their children. They
fail, in that they do not start in time to instruct the children
in the things they should know, and which would be of everlasting 
benefit to them through time and eternity.</p>
          <pb id="mccmary108" n="108"/>
          <p><sic>Some one</sic> asked how old a daughter should be before her
mother begins to instruct her. The answer is given: Twenty
years before the child is born. In explanation of this answer
it is only necessary to state that a mother should be well instructed 
in order that she may impart the same to her daughter. 
She should spend much time in instructing her children,
so much so that she should never allow them to keep any
secrets from her. The mother should be able in all actions of
her children to show them the right and wrong. There are
many things the girls should know before they go out into society. 
If the mothers do not tell them at the proper time,
they will learn it from some one who is probably not careful to
instruct them in the right and wrong. The writer wishes to
impress upon mothers the necessity of telling their daughters
everything that they should know. Should they do this they
will never be compelled to look back with sorrow and grief because 
they failed to give such instruction as would keep them
in the path of purity and righteousness.</p>
          <p>Boys should be taught to live as pure a life as the girls.
Much disgrace, as well as crime and sin is committed among all
classes of people, both rich and poor, high and low. Possibly
only a portion of these will come to shame in the eyes of men,
but all must some time stand before the judge of all the earth
to give an account of their deeds, whether they be good or evil.
We live in such a fast age that very few mothers take time to
tell their children concerning eternal things, which would save
them many times from sin and disgrace. The great responsibility 
rests upon the mothers, and they need a great deal of
wisdom in order that they may give their children the best advice. 
In order to give such advice there must be praying
<pb id="mccmary109" n="109"/>
mothers. Then should her children depart from the way in
which she has led them the blame rests not upon her, since she
has done her whole duty. The Bible states that they will not
depart from the way.</p>
          <p>The writer humbly hopes that every mother who may
chance to read these few lines will take great pains in trying
to follow the advice given. Although the writer is only one in
the common walks of life, yet he has great sympathy with
mothers who are training children for this life and that to
come. Some mothers spend most of their time preparing their
children for this world. That is all right so far as it goes, but
the preparations for the world to come should come first. If
that is neglected all is lost. The word says: “What shall it
profit a man if he gain the whole world and lose his own soul.”
Great trouble and sorrow come to many mothers because they
do not begin in time to restrain their children from having
their own way. Every child, as soon as it can talk, should be
taught to mind. Children should always understand that
when the mother says anything she means it. Some mothers
will allow themselves to be forced to consent to disobedience on
the part of the child by protracted crying and screaming. This
is all wrong. Should a mother permit such actions a few times,
ever afterward the child will know exactly how to proceed in
gaining its wishes. When too late, the mother will see her
mistake.</p>
          <p>Beware, mothers! A hint to the wise is sufficient. In
these last days there are but few praying mothers. They do
everything else but pray. There are but few children that
have heard their mother pray for them. Some go through a
form of prayer, but do not know of the mighty power of God
<pb id="mccmary110" n="110"/>
that saves a soul from all sin. The Bible says all are born in
sin, and it is safe to add that most all children are brought up
in sin and die in sin. Their blood will cry out against the
parents in the soon-coming judgment. O! mothers, be wise
and seek the Lord with your whole heart, that you may be converted, 
so as to pray for your children. There is not much
preaching done these days, under the power of the Holy Ghost,
that will arouse men and women out of their sleep in sin, so
that they may see their lost condition and that their children
are lost with them. Children in these days know the Bible
salvation, if their parents belong to the church, and many of
them think that they must join the church too. So, therefore
they all drift along <sic>unawakened</sic> to the terrible wrath of God,
which will come upon all that are not converted and saved from
their sins.</p>
          <p>Now, let the parents do their duty toward the children.
Then they will not need to look back in regret and see wherein
they have failed in giving proper training. And let the children 
do their duty toward their parents in all things, that their
days may be long upon the earth.</p>

          <head rend="capitalized"> A FEW THOUGHTS ON MARRIAGE.</head>
          <p>It is in the mind of the writer to write a few words on the
subject of marriage, setting forth the cause for so many unhappy 
marriages. In the first place, in this day young people
do not take long enough to consider this holy union before
entering into it. When a young man begins to think of getting 
married he does not stop to think of anything except to
get a wife, and most all girls act in a similar manner. The
Bible says: “He that findeth himself a wife findeth a good
thing and obtains the favor of God.” Prov. 18: 22; 31: 10,
11, 12. Read also <rs>Ephesians</rs> 5: 25-28. There are so many
things that should be carefully considered before entering into
the marriage relation. The first thing the prospective wife
should do is to consider that the marriage union is a holy one,
and, second, that it should continue until death shall part
them. If these points were carefully considered before marriage, 
in connection with a few others, there would be few, if
any, divorces. Third, the temper and habits of each should be
carefully studied. If a man is very quick tempered and
marries a woman of similar nature they will never live happily
together, especially if the man takes a drink of whisky occasionally. 
If the woman finds out before their marriage that
the man drinks she had better break the engagement. If she
<pb id="mccmary112" n="112"/>
does not, she might just as well put a rattlesnake into her
bosom and say that it would not bite her as to think of living
happily with a man that will drink.</p>
          <p> Some women will say: “Oh, I will make him promise
me that he will quit drinking before I will marry him.” He
tells her that he will never drink any more, and she believes it
will be all right to marry him. Then they prepare for the
wedding. The present looks very bright indeed and the future
seems full of roses. Many that see the newly married couple
think they can never have any trouble. Everything goes along
all right for a time, but trouble will come sooner or later to
that home, as it does to every home. One sorrow passes, only
to give place to another and another until the man and wife
scarcely know what to do. The husband, who has promised
that he would never drink any more, forgets his promise and
takes to drinking, under the impression that it will assist him
in bearing the sorrows of himself and his family. One drink
calls for another and soon he begins to neglect his family.
The wife, seeing that he has broken his promise, is at her wit's
end, scarcely knowing what to do. Some of her friends will
advise her not to live with him. She applies for a divorce, and
the court will grant it, according to law.</p>
          <p>I would advise a woman, if she knows a man drinks before
she marries him, not to marry him. The Bible says that the
woman which hath a husband is bound by the law to him so
long as he sinneth, but if he be dead she is loosed from him.
Read <rs>Romans</rs> 7: 2, 3. In the present age men have become so
blind in sin and lust that they do not regard the law of God,
but push onward in a mad rush to have their sinful appetites
and fashions satisfied. Virtue and purity are almost unknown.
<pb id="mccmary113" n="113"/>
Men and women think it all right to have three or four living
husbands and wives, because the popular ministers of to-day
do not cry out against the awful sin of adultery, and the people 
go on in all kinds of sin and crime without fear of God's
judgment, which He will in due time pour out upon the ungodly
men and women.</p>
          <p>Most young boys and girls before they are old enough to
go out in company, talk among themselves about their beaus
or sweethearts. Many mothers engage in this kind of talk
with their children, and in this way the subject of marriage is
so common among the boys and girls before they are of age.
Many girls are married at the age of fourteen or fifteen and
boys at seventeen or eighteen years. Many at the age of
twenty-five or thirty have had two or three husbands or wives.
They do not think of the great duty and care marriage should
place upon them. The most they think of is to have a good
happy time, but instead of a happy time they have trouble,
sorrow and dissatisfaction. The result is everything except
what they expected.</p>
          <p>Some marry for one thing and some for another. The writer
asked a certain young lady why she wished to marry a certain
young man. She answered that I may have a home, and
added: “I think he will be good to me.” The writer said:
“Suppose he has no home to take you to, what will you do
then?” She could give no answer, although she was past
twenty-five years of age. She had engaged herself to him
without any consideration for the future. No doubt most
young people marry that way, especially among the common
people. The rich are more careful in their marriages, but will
have their troubles also, though they <sic corr="may" resp="NS">man</sic> be able to hide them
<pb id="mccmary114" n="114"/>
from the public. A young lady will marry a young man because 
he is pretty and dresses well; another because the young
man has a good position; another because his father or mother
has an abundance of money. Or a young man may desire to
marry a young lady for similar reasons. Marriages with such
motives as these cannot fail to be unhappy. The Bible says he
who builds his house on a sandy foundation shall lose all when
the storms and troubles of life come.</p>
          <p>To such marriages troubles are sure to come. Sometimes
everything is lost in wild speculations, sometimes through dishonesty, 
or by sickness and death. Sometimes a man will
murder his wife or a woman her husband. Sometimes husbands 
will run off with other men's wives, or wives with other
women's husbands. When such trials as these come into the
family, who then is able to bear all the distress. No family is
able to withstand such trials unless supported by the grace of
God. This is not much thought of by the young people of
to-day. All they think of is to have a good and happy time.
Oh! what a sad mistake all are making who expect to have a
happy time in this life without the grace of God in their soul.</p>
          <p>Oh! that the young and old would stop and think before
they go farther. All the things in this world cannot make one
truly happy, for true happiness does not consist in the things
of this world. Men may have plenty of money, and possess
banks, farms, railroads, horses, fine homes, carriages, cattle,
and, in fact, everything the world calls good, and yet they cannot 
build their hopes of happiness on any of these, for they
will all perish. Thousands and thousands of families have all
these and everything that the heart could wish for, and yet
there is no true happiness in these homes without the religion
<pb id="mccmary115" n="115"/>
of the Lord Jesus Christ. There is something in the soul of
man that all the things of this world cannot satisfy without
true religion.</p>
          <p>Oh! how strange and sad it is that the human heart seeks
happiness in every way before turning to true happiness, which
is the love of God in the soul. The Bible says: “Seek first
the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness and all things else
shall be added unto you.” It does seem that all the endeavors
of mankind are lost in a mad rush to seek the pleasures of this
world and have a good time. The Bible says: “This world
and all its pleasures shall pass away, but he that doeth the
will of God abides forever and forever.” Oh! old men, old
women, young men, young women, boys, girls, will you be wise
and choose eternal life rather than to enjoy the sinful pleasures 
of this life for a short season?</p>
