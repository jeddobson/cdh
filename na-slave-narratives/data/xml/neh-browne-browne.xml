            <p>THE OLD KENTUCKY FARM—MY PARENTAGE AND EARLY
TRAINING—DEATH OF THE MASTER—THE SALE-DAY—NEW MASTER 
AND NEW HOME.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I WAS born in one of the southern counties of Kentucky.
My earliest recollections are of a large, old-fashioned farm-house,
built of hewn rock, in which my old master, Mr. Nelson, and
his family, consisting of a widowed sister, two daughters and
two sons, resided. I have but an indistinct remembrance of
my old master. At times, a shadow of an idea, like the reflection
of a kind dream, comes over my mind, and, then, I conjure
him up as a large, venerable-looking man, with scanty, gray locks
floating carelessly over an amplitude of forehead; a wide,
hard-featured face, with yet a kindly glow of honest sentiment;
broad, strong teeth, much discolored by the continued use of
tobacco.</p>
          <p>I well remember that, as a token of his good-will, he always
presented us (the slave-children) with a slice of buttered bread,
when we had finished our daily task. I have also a faint
<hi rend="italics">reminiscence</hi> of his old hickory cane being shaken over my head
two or three times, and the promise (which remained, until his
death, unfulfilled) of a good “<hi rend="italics">thrashing</hi>” at some future period.</p>
          <p>My mother was a very bright mulatto woman, and my father,
<pb id="browne10" n="10"/>
I suppose, was a white man, though I know nothing of him;
for, with the most unpaternal feeling, he deserted me. A
consequence of this amalgamation was my very fair and beautiful
complexion. My skin was no perceptible shade darker than
that of my young mistresses. My eyes were large and dark, while
a profusion of nut-brown hair, straight and soft as the whitest
lady's in the land, fell in showery redundance over my neck and
shoulders. I was often mistaken for a white child; and in my
rambles through the woods, many caresses have I received from
wayside travellers; and the exclamation, “What a beautiful
child!” was quite common. Owing to this personal beauty I
was a great pet with my master's sister, Mrs. Woodbridge, who,
I believe I have stated, was a widow, and childless; so upon
me she lavished all the fondness of a warm and loving heart.</p>
          <p>My mother, Keziah the cook, commonly called Aunt Kaisy,
was possessed of an indomitable ambition, and had, by the
hardest means, endeavored to acquire the rudiments of an education;
but all that she had succeeded in obtaining was a
knowledge of the alphabet, and orthography in two syllables.
Being very imitative, she eschewed the ordinary negroes' pronunciation,
and adopted the mode of speech used by the higher classes
of whites. She was very much delighted when Mrs. Woodbridge
or Miss Betsy (as we called her) began to instruct me in the
elements of the English language. I inherited my mother's
thirst for knowledge; and, by intense study, did all I could to
spare Miss Betsy the usual drudgery of a teacher. The aptitude
that I displayed, may be inferred from the fact that, in three
months from the day she began teaching me the alphabet, I was
reading, with some degree of fluency, in the “First Reader.”
I have often heard her relate this as quite a literary and educational
marvel.</p>
          <p>There were so many slaves upon the farm, particularly young
ones, that I was regarded as a supernumerary; consequently
spared from nearly all the work. I sat in Miss Betsy's room:
with book in hand, little heeding anything else; and, if ever I
manifested the least indolence, my mother, with her wild ambition
<pb id="browne11" n="11"/>
was sure to rally me, and even offer the tempting bribe of
cakes and apples.</p>
          <p>I have frequently heard my old master say, “Betsy, you
will spoil that girl, teaching her so much.” “She is too pretty
for a slave,” was her invariable reply.</p>
          <p>Thus smoothly passed the early part of my life, until an event
occurred which was the cause of a change in my whole fate.
My old master became suddenly and dangerously ill. My lessons
were suspended, for Miss Betsy's services were required in
the sick chamber. I used to slyly steal to the open door of his
room, and peep in, with wonder, at the sombre group collected
there. I recollect seeing my young masters and mistresses
weeping round a curtained bed. Then there came a time when
loud screams and frightful lamentations issued thence. There
were shrieks that struck upon my ear with a strange thrill;
shrieks that seemed to rend souls and break heart-strings. My
young mistresses, fair, slender girls, fell prostrate upon the floor;
and my masters, noble, manly men, bent over the bowed forms
of their sisters, whispering words which I did not hear, but
which, my mature experience tells me, must have been of love
and comfort.</p>
          <p>There came, then, a long, narrow, black box, thickly embossed
with shining brass tacks, in which my old master was carefully
laid, with his pale, brawny hands crossed upon his wide chest.
I remember that, one by one, the slaves were called in to take
a last look of him who had been, to them, a kind master. They
all came out with their cotton handkerchiefs pressed to their
eyes. I went in, with five other colored children, to take my
look. That wan, ghastly face, those sunken eyes and pinched
features, with the white winding sheet, and the dismal coffin,
impressed me with a new and wild terror; and, for weeks after,
this “vision of death” haunted my mind fearfully.</p>
          <p>But I soon after resumed my studies under Miss Betsy's
tuition. Having little work to do, and seldom seeing my young
mistresses, I grew up in the same house, scarcely knowing them.
I was technically termed in the family, “the child,” as I was
<pb id="browne12" n="12"/>
not black; and, being a slave, my masters and mistresses would
not admit that I was white. So I reached the age of ten, still
called “a child,” and actually one in all life's experiences, though
pretty well advanced in education. I had a very good knowledge
of the rudiments, had bestowed some attention upon Grammar,
and eagerly read every book that fell in my way. Love
of study taught me seclusive habits; I read long and late; and
the desire of a finished education became the passion of my life.
Alas! these days were but a poor preparation for the life that
was to come after!</p>
          <p>Miss Betsy, though a warm-hearted woman, was a violent
advocate of slavery. I have since been puzzled how to reconcile
this with her otherwise Christian character; and, though
she professed to love me dearly, and had bestowed so much
attention upon the cultivation of my mind, and expressed it as
her opinion that I was too pretty and white to be a slave, yet,
if any one had spoken of giving me freedom, she would have
condemned it as domestic heresy. If I had belonged to her, I
doubt not but my life would have been a happy one. But, alas!
a different lot was assigned me!</p>
          <p>About two years and six months after my old master's death,
a division was made of the property. This involved a sale of
everything, even the household furniture. There were, I believe,
heavy debts hanging over the estate. These must be met,
and the residue divided among the heirs.</p>
          <p>When it was made known in the kitchen that a sale was to
be made, the slaves were panic-stricken. Loud cries and lamentations
arose, and my young mistresses came often to the kitchen
to comfort us.</p>
          <p>One of these young ladies, Miss Margaret, a tall, nobly formed
girl, with big blue eyes and brown hair, frequently came and
sat with us, trying, in the most persuasive tones, to reconcile
the old ones to their destiny. Often did I see the large tears
roll down her fair cheeks, and her red lip quiver. These indications
of sympathy, coming from such a lovely being, cheered
many an hour of after-captivity.</p>
          <pb id="browne13" n="13"/>
          <p>But the“sale-day” came at last; I have a confused idea of
it. The ladies left the day before. Miss Betsy took an
affectionate leave of me; ah, I did not then know that it was a
final one.</p>
          <p>The servants were all sold, as I heard one man say, at very
high rates, though not under the auctioneer's hammer. To that
my young masters were opposed.</p>
          <p>A tall, hard-looking man came up to me, very roughly seized
my arm, bade me open my mouth; examined my teeth; felt of
my limbs; made me run a few yards; ordered me to jump;
and, being well satisfied with my activity, said to Master Edward,
“I will take her.” Little comprehending the full meaning
of that brief sentence, I rejoined the group of children from
which I had been summoned. After awhile, my mother came
up to me, holding a wallet in her hand. The tear-drops stood
on her cheeks, and her whole frame was distorted with pain.
She walked toward me a few steps, then stopped, and suddenly
shaking her head, exclaimed, “No, no, I can't do it, I can't do
it.” I was amazed at her grief, but an indefinable fear kept me
from rushing to her.</p>
          <p>“Here, Kitty,” she said to an old negro woman, who stood
near, “you break it to her. I can't do it. No, it will drive me
mad. Oh, heaven! that I was ever born to see this day.”
Then rocking her body back and forward in a transport of agony,
she gave full vent to her feelings in a long, loud, piteous wail.
Oh, God! that cry of grief, that knell of a breaking heart, rang
in my ears for many long and painful days. At length Aunt
Kitty approached me, and, laying her hand on my shoulder,
kindly said:</p>
          <p>“Alas, poor chile, you mus' place your trus' in the good God
above, you mus' look to Him for help; you are gwine to leave
your mother now. You are to have a new home, a new master,
and I hope new friends. May the Lord be with you.” So saying,
she broke suddenly away from me; but I saw that her
wrinkled face was wet with tears.</p>
          <p>With perhaps an idle, listless air, I received this astounding
<pb id="browne14" n="14"/>
news; but a whirlwind was gathering in my breast. What
could she mean by new friends and a new home? Surely I
was to take my mother with me! No mortal power would dare
to sever <hi rend="italics">us</hi>. Why, I remember that when master sold the gray
mare, the colt went also. Who could, who would, who dared,
separate the parent from her offspring? Alas! I had yet to
learn that the white man dared do all that his avarice might
suggest; and there was no human tribunal where the outcast
African could pray for “right!” Ah, when I now think of my
poor mother's form, as it swayed like a willow in the tempest
of grief; when I remember her bitter cries, and see her arms
thrown franticly toward me, and hear her earnest—oh, how
earnest—prayer for death or madness, then I wonder where were
Heaven's thunderbolts; but retributive Justice <hi rend="italics">will</hi> come sooner
or later, and He who remembers mercy <hi rend="italics">now</hi> will not forget
justice <hi rend="italics">then</hi>.</p>
          <p>“Come along, gal, come along, gather up your duds, and
come with me,” said a harsh voice; and, looking up from my
bewildered reverie, I beheld the man who had so carefully
examined me. I was too much startled to fully understand the
words, and stood vacantly gazing at him. This strange manner
he construed into disrespect; and, raising his riding-whip,
he brought it down with considerable force upon my back. It
was the first lash I had ever given to me in anger. I smarted
beneath the stripe, and a cry of pain broke from my lips.
Mother sprang to me, and clasping my quivering form in her
arms, cried out to my young master, “Oh, Master Eddy, have
mercy on me, on my child. I have served you faithfully, I
nursed you, I grew up with your poor mother, who now sleeps
in the cold ground, I beg you now to save <hi rend="italics">my child</hi>,” and she
sank down at his feet, whilst her tears fell fast.</p>
          <p>Then my poor old grandfather, who was called the patriarch
slave, being the eldest one of the race in the whole neighborhood,
joined us. His gray head, wrinkled face, and bent form,
told of many a year of hard servitude.</p>
          <p>“What is it, Massa Ed, what is it Kaisy be takin' on so
<pb id="browne15" n="15"/>
'bout? You haint driv the <hi rend="italics">chile</hi> off? No—no! Young massa
only playin' trick now; come Kais' don't be makin' fool of yoursef
young massa not gwine to separate you and the chile.”</p>
          <p>These words seemed to reanimate my mother, and she looked
up at Master Edward with a grateful expression of face, whilst
she clasped her arms tightly around his knees, exclaiming, “Oh,
bless you, young master, bless you forever, and forgive poor
Kaisy for distrusting you, but Pompey told me the child was
sold away from me, and that gemman struck her;” and here
again she sobbed, and caught hold of me convulsively, as if she
feared I might be taken.</p>
          <p>I looked at my young master's face, and the ghastly whiteness
which overspread it, the tearful glister of his eye, and the
strange tremor of his figure, struck me with fright. <hi rend="italics">I knew my
doom.</hi> Young as I was, my first dread was for my mother; I
forgot my own perilous situation, and mourned alone for her.
I would have given worlds could insensibility have been granted
her.</p>
          <p>“I've got no time to be foolin' longer with these niggers,
come 'long, gal. Ann, I believe, you tole me was her name,”
he said, as he turned to Master Edward. Another wild shriek
from my mother, a deep sigh from grandpap, and I looked at
master Ed, who was striking his forehead vehemently, and the
tears were trickling down his cheeks.</p>
          <p>“Here, Mr. Peterkin, here!” exclaimed Master Edward, “here
is your bill of sale; I will refund your money; release me from
my contract.”</p>
          <p>Peterkin cast on him one contemptuous look, and with a
low, chuckling laugh, replied, “No; you must stand to your
bargain. I want that gal; she is likely, and it will do me good
to thrash the devil out of her;” turning to me he added, “quit
your snuffling and snubbing, or I'll give you something to cry
'bout;” and, roughly catching me by the arm, he hurried me
off, despite the entreaty of Master Ed, the cries of mother, and
the feeble supplication of my grandfather, I dared to cast one
look behind, and beheld my mother wallowing in the dust,
<pb id="browne16" n="16"/>
whilst her frantic cries of “save my child, save my child!” rang
with fearful agony in my ears. Master Ed covered his face
with his hands, and old grandfather reverently raised his to
Heaven, as if beseeching mercy. The sight of this anguish-stricken
group filled me with a new sense of horror, and forgetful
of the presence of Peterkin, I burst into tears: but I was
quickly recalled by a fierce and stinging blow from his stout
riding-whip.</p>
          <p>“See here, nigger (this man, raised among negroes, used
their dialect), if you dar' to give another whimper, I'll beat the
very life out 'en yer.” This terrific threat seemed to scare
away every thought of precaution; and, by a sudden and agile
bound, I broke loose from him and darted off to the sad group,
from which I had been so ruthlessly torn, and, sinking down
before Master Ed, I cried out in a wild, despairing tone, “Save
me, good master, save me—kill me, or hide me from that awful
man, he'll kill me;” and, seizing hold of the skirt of his coat,
I covered my face with it to shut out the sight of Peterkin,
whose -red eye-balls were glaring with fury upon me. Oath
after oath escaped his lips. Mother saw him rapidly approaching
to recapture me, and, with the noble, maternal instinct of
self-sacrifice, sprang forward only to receive the heavy blow of
his uplifted whip. She reeled, tottered and sank stunned upon
the ground.</p>
          <p>“Thar, take that, you yaller hussy, and cuss yer nigger hide
for daring to raise this rumpus here,” he said, as he rapidly
strode past her.</p>
          <p>Gently, Mr. Peterkin,“ exclaimed Master Edward, “let me
speak to her; a little encouragement is better than force.”</p>
          <p>“This is my encouragement for them,” and he shook his
whip.</p>
          <p>Unheeding him, Master Edward turned to me, saying, “Ann,
come now, be a good girl, go with this gentleman, and be an
obedient girl; he will give you a kind, nice home; sometimes
he will let you come to see your mother. Here is some money
for you to buy a pretty head-handkerchief; now go with him.”
<pb id="browne17" n="17"/>
These kind words and encouraging tones, brought a fresh gush
of tears to my eyes. Taking the half-dollar which he offered
me, and reverently kissing the skirt of his coat, I rejoined
Peterkin; one look at his cold, harsh face, chilled my resolution;
yet I had resolved to go without another word of complaint.
I could not suppress a groan when I passed the spot
where my mother lay still insensible from the effects of the blow<sic corr="."/></p>
          <p>One by one the servants, old and young, gave me a hearty
shake of the hand as I passed the place where they were standing
in a row for the inspection of buyers.</p>
          <p>I had nerved myself, and now that the parting from mother
was over, I felt that the bitterness of death was past, and I
could meet anything. Nothing now could be a trial, yet I was
touched when the servants offered me little mementoes and
keepsakes. One gave a yard of ribbon, another a half-paper
of pins, a third presented a painted cotton head-tie; others
gave me ginger-cakes, candies, or small coins. Out of their
little they gave abundantly, and, small as were the bestowments,
I well knew that they had made sacrifices to give even so much.
I was too deeply affected to make any other acknowledgment
than a nod of the head; for a choking thickness was gathering
in my throat, and a blinding mist obscured my sight. I did
not see my young mistresses, for they had left the house,
declaring they could not bear to witness a spectacle so revolting
to their feelings.</p>
          <p>Upon reaching the gate I observed a red-painted wagon,
with an awning of domestic cotton. Standing near it, and holding
the horses, was an old, worn, scarred, weather-beaten negro
man, who instantly took off his hat as Mr. Peterkin approached.</p>
          <p>“Well, Nace, you see I've bought this wench to-day,” and
he shook his whip over my head.</p>
          <p>“Ya! ya! Massa, but she ha' got one goot home wid yer.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, has she, Nace; but don't yer think the slut has been
cryin' 'bout it!”</p>
          <p>“Lor' bless us, Massa, but a little of the beech-tree will fetch
<pb id="browne18" n="18"/>
that sort of truck out of her,” and old Nace showed his broken
teeth, as he gave a forced laugh.</p>
          <p>“I guess I can take the fool out en her, by the time I gives
her two or three swings at the whippin'-post.”</p>
          <p>Nace shook his head knowingly, and gave a low guttural
laugh, by way of approval of his master's capabilities.</p>
          <p>“Jump in the wagon, gal,” said my new master, “jump in
quick; I likes to see niggers active, none of your pokes 'bout
me; but this will put sperit in 'em”, and there was another
defiant flourish of the whip.</p>
          <p>I got in with as much haste and activity as I could possibly
command. This appeared to please Mr. Peterkin, and he gave
evidence of it by saying,—</p>
          <p>“Well, that does pretty well; a few stripes a day, and you'll
be a valerble slave;” and, getting in the vehicle himself, he
ordered Nace to drive on “<hi rend="italics">pretty peart,</hi>” as night would soon
overtake us.</p>
          <p>Just as we were starting I perceived Josh, one of my
playmates, running after us with a small bundle, shouting, —</p>
          <p>“Here, Ann, you've lef' yer bundle of close.”</p>
          <p>“Stop, Nace,” said Mr. Peterkin, “let's git the gal's duds, or
I'll be put to the 'spence of gittin' new ones for her.”</p>
          <p>Little Josh came bounding up, and, with an affectionate manner,
handed me the little wallet that contained my entire wardrobe.
I leaned forward, and, in a muffled tone, but with my
whole heart hanging on my lip, asked Josh “how is mother?”
but a cut of Nace's whip, and a quick “gee-up,” put me beyond
the hearing of the reply. I strained my eyes after Josh, to
interpret the motion of his lips.</p>
          <p>In a state of hopeless agony I sat through the remainder of
the journey. The coarse jokes and malignant threats of Mr.
Peterkin were answered with laughing and dutiful assent by the
veteran Nace. I tried to deceive my persecutors by feigning
sleep, but, ah, a strong finger held my lids open, and slumber
fled away to gladden lighter hearts and bless brighter eyes.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>A VIEW OF THE NEW HOME.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE young moon had risen in mild and meek serenity to bless
the earth. With a strange and fluctuating light, the pale rays
played over the leaves and branches of the forest trees, and
flickered fantastically upon the ground! Only a few stars were
discernible in the highest dome of heaven! The lowing of
wandering cows, or the chirp of a night-bird, had power to beguile
memory back to a thousand vanished joys. I mused and
wept; still the wagon jogged along. Mr. Peterkin sat half-sleeping
beside old Nace, whose occasional “gee-up” to the
lagging horses, was the only human sound that broke the soft
serenity! Every moment seemed to me an age, for I dreaded
the awakening of my cruel master. Ah, little did I dream that
that horrid day's experience was but a brief foretaste of what
I had yet to suffer; and well it was for me that a kind and
merciful Providence veiled that dismal future from my gaze.
About midnight I had fallen into a quiet sleep, gilded by the
sweetest dream, a dream of the old farm-house, of mother,
grandfather, and my companions.</p>
          <p>From this vision I was aroused by the gruff voice of Peterkin,
bidding me get out of the wagon. That voice was to me
more frightful and fearful than the blast of the last trump.
Springing suddenly up, I threw off the shackles of sleep; and
consciousness, with all its direful burden, returned fully to me.
Looking round, by the full light of the moon, I beheld a large
country house, half hidden among trees. A white paling enclosed
the ground, and the scent of dewy roses and other garden
flowers filled the atmosphere.</p>
          <p>“Now, Nace, put up the team, and git yourself to bed,” said
<pb id="browne20" n="20"/>
Peterkin. Turning to me he added, “give this gal a blanket,
and let her sleep on the floor in Polly's cabin; keep a good
watch on her, that she don't try to run off.”</p>
          <p>“Needn't fear dat, Massa, for de bull-dog tear her to pieces
if she 'tempt dat. By gar, I'd like to see her be for tryin' it;”
and the old negro gave a fiendish laugh, as though he thought it
would be rare sport.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin entered the handsome house, of which he was
the rich and respected owner, whilst I, conducted by Nace,
repaired to a dismal cabin. After repeated knocks at the door of
this most wretched hovel, an old crone of a negress muttered
between her clenched teeth, “Who's dar?”</p>
          <p>“It's me, Polly; what you be 'bout dar, dat you don't let me
in?”</p>
          <p>“What for you be bangin' at my cabin? I's got no bisness
wid you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but I's got bisness wid you; stir yer ole stumps now.”</p>
          <p>“I shan't be for troublin' mysef and lettin' you in my cabin
at dis hour ob de night-time; and if you doesn't be off, I'll
make Massa gib you a sound drubbin' in de mornin'.”</p>
          <p>“Ha, ha! now I'm gots you sure; for massa sends me here
himsef.”</p>
          <p>This was enough for Polly; she broke off all further colloquy,
and opened the door instantly.</p>
          <p>The pale moonlight rested as lovingly upon that dreary,
unchinked, rude, and wretched hovel, as ever it played over the
gilded roof and frescoed dome of ancient palaces; but ah, what
squalor did it not reveal! There, resting upon pallets of straw,
like pigs in a litter, were groups of children, and upon a rickety
cot the old woman reposed her aged limbs. How strange,
lonely, and forbidding appeared that tenement, as the old woman
stood in the doorway, her short and scanty kirtles but poorly
concealing her meagre limbs. A dark, scowling countenance
looked out from under a small cap of faded muslin; little bleared
eyes glared upon me, like the red light of a heated furnace.
Instinctively I shrank back from her, but Nace was tired, and not
<pb id="browne21" n="21"/>
wishing to be longer kept from his bed, pushed me within the
door, saying—</p>
          <p>“Thar, Polly, Massa say dat gal mus' sleep in dar.”</p>
          <p>“Come 'long in, gal,” said the woman. and closing the door,
she pointed to a patch of straw, “sleep dar.”</p>
          <p>The moonbeams stole in through the crevices and cracks of
the cabin, and cast a mystic gleam upon the surrounding objects.
Without further word or comment, Polly betook herself to her
cot, and was soon snoring away as though there were no such
thing as care or slavery in the world. But to me sleep was a
stranger. There I lay through the remaining hours of the
night, wearily thinking of mother and home. “Sold,” I murmured.
“What is it to be sold? Why was <hi rend="italics">I</hi> sold? Why
separated from my mother and friends? Why couldn't mother
come with me, or I stay with her? I never saw Mr. Peterkin
before. Who gave him the right to force me from my good
home and kind friends?” These questions would arise in my
mind, and, alas! I had no answers for them. Young and ignorant
as I was, I had yet some glimmering idea of justice. Later
in life, these same questions have often come to me, as sad
commentaries upon the righteousness of human laws; and, when
sitting in splendid churches listening to ornate and <hi rend="italics">worldly</hi>
harangues from <hi rend="italics">holy men</hi>, these same thoughts have tingled
upon my tongue. And I have been surprised to see how
strangely these men mistake the definition of servitude. Why,
from the exposition of the worthy divines, one would suppose
that servitude was a fair synonym for slavery! Admitting
that we are the descendants of the unfortunate Ham, and
endure our bondage as the penalty affixed to his crime, there
can be no argument or fact adduced, whereby to justify slavery
as a moral right. Serving and being a slave are very different.
And why may not Ham's descendants claim a reprieve by virtue
of the passion and death of Christ? Are we excluded from the
grace of that atonement? No; there is no argument, no reason,
to justify slavery, save that of human cupidity. But there will
come a day, when each and every one who has violated that
<pb id="browne22" n="22"/>
divine rule, “Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you,” will stand with a fearful accountability before the Supreme
Judge. Then will there be loud cries and lamentations,
and a wish for the mountains to hide them from the eye of
Judicial Majesty.</p>
          <p>The next morning I rose with the dawn, and sitting upright
upon my pallet, surveyed the room and its tenants. There, in
comfortless confusion, upon heaps of straw, slumbered five
children, dirty and ragged. On the broken cot, with a remnant of
a coverlet thrown over her, lay Aunt Polly. A few broken
stools and one pine box, with a shelf containing a few tins,
constituted the entire furniture.</p>
          <p>“And this wretched pen is to be my home; these dirty-looking
children my associates.” Oh, how dismal were my thoughts;
but little time had I for reflection. The shrill sound of a hunting-horn
was the summons for the servants to arise, and woe
unto him or her who was found missing or tardy when the
muster-roll was called. Aunt Polly and the five children sprang
up, and soon dressed themselves. They then appeared in the
yard, where a stout, athletic man, with full beard and a dull eye,
stood with whip in hand. He called over the names of all, and
portioned out their daily task. With a smile more of terror than
pleasure, they severally received their orders. I stood at the
extremity of the range. After disposing of them in order, the
overseer (for such he was) looked at me fiercely, and said:</p>
          <p>“Come here, gal.”</p>
          <p>With a timid step, I obeyed.</p>
          <p>“What are you fit for? Not much of anything, ha?” and
catching hold of my ear he pulled me round in front of him,
saying,</p>
          <p>“Well, you are likely-looking; how much work can you
do?”</p>
          <p>I stammered out something as to my willingness to do anything
that was required of me. He examined my hands, and
concluding from their dimensions that I was best suited for
house-work, he bade me remain in the kitchen until after
<pb id="browne23" n="23"/>
breakfast. When I entered the room designated, <foreign lang="fre">par politesse</foreign>,
as the kitchen, I was surprised to find such a desolate and
destitute-looking place. The apartment, which was very small,
seemed to be a sort of Pandora's Box, into which everything of
household or domestic use had been crowded. The walls were
hung round with saddles, bridles, horse-blankets, &amp;c. Upon a
swinging shelf in the centre of the room were ranged all the
seeds, nails, ropes, dried elms, and the rest of the thousand and
one little notions of domestic economy. A rude, wooden shelf
contained a dark, dusty row of unclean tins; broken stools and old
kegs were substituted for chairs; upon these were stationed
four or five ebony children; one of them, a girl about nine years
old, with a dingy face, to which soap and water seemed foreign,
and with shaggy, moppy hair, twisted in short, stringy plaits, sat
upon a broken keg, with a squalid baby in her lap, which she
jostled upon her knee, whilst she sang in a sharp key, 
“hushy-by-baby.” Three other wretched children, in 
tow-linen dresses, whose brevity of skirts made a sad appeal 
to the modesty of spectators, were perched round this girl, 
whom they called Amy. They were furiously begging Aunt 
Polly (the cook) to give them a piece of hoe-cake.</p>
          <p>“Be off wid you, or I'll tell Massa, or de overseer,” answered
the beldame, as their solicitations became more clamorous.
This threat had power to silence the most earnest demands of
the stomach, for the fiend of hunger was far less dreaded than
the lash of Mr. Jones, the overseer. My entrance, and the
sight of a strange face, was a diversion for them. They crowded
closer to Amy, and eyed me with a half doubtful, and altogether
ludicrous air.</p>
          <p>“Who's her?” “whar she come from?” “when her gwyn away?” and such like expressions, escaped them in stifled
tones.</p>
          <p>“Come in, set down,” said Aunt Polly to me, and, turning to
the group of children, she levelled a poker at them.</p>
          <p>“Keep still dar, or I'll break your pates 'wid dis poker.”</p>
          <p>Instantly they cowered down beside Amy, still peeping over
<pb id="browne24" n="24"/>
her shoulder, to get a better view of me. With a very uneasy
feeling I seated myself upon the broken stool, to which Aunt
Polly pointed. One of the boldest of the children came up to
me, and, slyly touching my dress, said, “tag,” then darted off
to her hiding-place, with quite the air of a victress. Amy
made queer grimaces at me. Every now and then placing her
thumb to her nose, and gyrating her finger towards me, she
would drawl out, “you ka-n-t kum it.” All this was perfect
jargon to me; for at home, though we had been but imperfectly
protected by clothing from the vicissitudes of seasons, and
though our fare was simple, coarse, and frugal, had we been
kindly treated, and our manners trained into something like the
softness of humanity. There, as regularly as the Sunday
dawned, were we summoned to the house to hear the Bible
read, and join (though at a respectful distance) with the family
in prayer. But this I subsequently learned was an unusual
practice in the neighborhood, and was attributed to the fact,
that my master's wife had been born in the State of Massachusetts,
where the people were crazy and fanatical enough to believe
that “niggers” had souls, and were by God held to be
responsible beings.</p>
          <p>The loud blast of the horn was the signal for the “hands”
to suspend their labor and come to breakfast. Two negro men
and three women rushed in at the door, ravenous for their
rations. I looked about for the table, but, seeing none, concluded
it had yet to be arranged; for at home we always took our
meals on a table. I was much surprised to see each one here
take a slice of fat bacon and a pone of bread in his or her hand,
and eat it standing.</p>
          <p>“Well,” said one man, “I'd like to git a bit more bread.”</p>
          <p>“You's had your sher,” replied Aunt Polly. “Mister Jones
ses one slice o' meat and a pone o' bread is to be the 'lowance.”</p>
          <p>“I knows it, but if thar's any scraps left from the house table,
you wimmin folks always gits it.”</p>
          <p>“Who's got de bes' right? Sure, and arn't de one who cooks
it got de bes' right to it?” asked Polly, with a triumphant voice.</p>
          <pb id="browne25" n="25"/>
          <p>“Ha, ha!” cried Nace, “here comes de breakfust leavin's,
now who's smartest shall have 'em;” whereupon Nace, his
comrade, and the three women, seized a waiter of fragments of
biscuit, broiled ham, coffee, &amp;c., the remains of the breakfast
prepared for the white family.</p>
          <p>“By gar,” cried Nace, “I've got de coffee-pot, and I'll drink
dis;” so, without further ceremony, he applied the spout to his
mouth, and, sans cream or sugar, he quaffed off the grounds.
Jake possessed himself of the ham, whilst the two women held
a considerable contest over a biscuit. Blow and lie passed frequently
between them. Aunt Polly brandished her skimmer-spoon,
as though it were Neptune's trident of authority; still
she could not allay the confusion which these excited cormorants
raised. The children yelled out and clamored for a bit; the
sight and scent of ham and biscuits so tantalized their palates,
that they forgot even the terror of the whip. I stood all agape,
looking on with amazement.</p>
          <p>The two belligerent women stood with eyes blazing like
comets, their arms twisted around each other in a very decided
and furious <foreign lang="fre">rencontre</foreign>. One of them, losing her balance, fell
upon the floor, and, dragging the other after her, they rolled
and wallowed in a cloud of dust, whilst the disputed biscuit, in
the heat of the affray, had been dropped on the hearth, where,
unperceived by the combatants, Nace had possessed himself of
it, and was happily masticating it.</p>
          <p>Melinda, the girl from whom the waiter had been snatched,
doubtless much disappointed by the loss of the debris, returned
to the house and made a report of the fracas.</p>
          <p>Instantly and unexpectedly, Jones, flaming with rage, stood
in the midst of the riotous group. Seizing hold of the women,
he knocked them on their heads with his clenched fists.</p>
          <p>“Hold, black wretches, come, I will give you a leetle fun;
off now to the post.”</p>
          <p>Then such appeals for mercy, promises of amendment, entreaties,
excuses, &amp;c., as the two women made, would have
touched a heart of stone; but Jones had power to resist even
<pb id="browne26" n="26"/>
the prayers of an angel. To him the cries of human suffering
and the agony of distress were music. My heart bled when I
saw the two victims led away, and I put my hands to my ears
to shut out the screams of distress which rang with a strange
terror on the morning air. Poor, oppressed African! thorny
and rugged is your path of life! Many a secret sigh and bleeding
tear attest your cruel martyrdom! Surely He, who careth alike
for the high and the low, looks not unmoved upon you, wearing
and groaning beneath the pressing burden and galling yoke of a
most inhuman bondage. For you there is no broad rock of Hope
or Peace to cast its shadow of rest in this “weary land.” You
must sow in tears and reap in sorrow. But He, who led the children
of Israel from the house of bondage and the fetters of captivity,
will, in His own inscrutable way, lead you from the condition
of despair, even by the pillar of fire and the cloud. Great
changes are occurring daily, old constitutions are tottering, old
systems, fraught with the cruelty of darker ages, are shaking
to their centres. Master minds are everywhere actively engaged.
Keen eyes and vigilant hearts are open to the wrongs
of the poor, the lowly and the outcast. An avenging angel sits
concealed 'mid the drapery of the wasting cloud, ready to pour
the vials of God's wrath upon a haughty and oppressive race.
In the threatened famine, see we nothing but an accidental
failure of the crops? In the exhausted coffers and empty public
treasury, is there nothing taught but the lesson of national extravagance?
In the virulence of disease, the increasing prevalence
of fatal epidemics, what do we read? Send for the seers,
the wise men of the nation, and bid them translate the “mysterious
writing on the wall.” Ah, well may ye shake, Kings
of Mammon, shake upon your tottering throne of human bones!
Give o'er your sports, suspend your orgies, dash down the jewelled
cup of unhallowed joy, sparkling as it is to the very brim.
You must pay, like him of old, the fearful price of sin. God
hath not heard, unmoved, the anguished cries of a down-trodden
and enslaved nation! And it needs no Daniel to tell, that
God hath numbered your Kingdom and it is finished.”</p>
          <pb id="browne27" n="27"/>
          <p>As may be supposed, I had little appetite for my breakfast,
but I managed to deceive others into the belief that I had made
a hearty meal. But those screams from half-famished wretches
had a fatal and terrifying fascination; never once could I
forget it.</p>
          <p>A look of fright was on the face of all. “They be gettin'
awful beatin' at the post,” muttered Nace, whilst a sardonic
smile flitted over his hard features. Was it not sad to behold
the depths of degradation into which this creature had fallen?
He could smile at the anguish of a fellow-creature. Originally,
his nature may have been kind and gentle; but a continuous
system of brutality had so deadened his sensibilities, that he
had no humanity left. <hi rend="italics">For this</hi>, the white man is accountable.</p>
          <p>After the breakfast was over, I received a summons to the
house. Following Melinda, I passed the door-sill, and stood in
the presence of the assembled household. A very strange
group I thought them. Two girls were seated beside the uncleared
breakfast table, “trying their fortune” (as the phrase
goes) with a cup of coffee-grounds and a spoon. The elder of
the two was a tall, thin girl, with sharp features, small gray
eyes, and red-hair done up in frizettes; the other was a prim,
dark-skinned girl, with a set of nondescript features, and hair
of no particular hue, or “just any color;” but with the same
harsh expression of face that characterized the elder. As she
received the magic cup from her sister, she exclaimed, “La,
Jane, it will only be two years until you are married,” and made
a significant grimace at her father (Mr. Peterkin), who sat
near the window indulging in the luxury of a cob-pipe. The
taller girl turned toward me, and asked,</p>
          <p>“Father, is that the new girl you bought at old Nelson's
sale?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, that's the gal. Does she suit you?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but dear me! how very light she is—almost white!
I know she will be impudent.”</p>
          <p>“She has come to the wrong place for the practice of that
article,” suggested the other.</p>
          <pb id="browne28" n="28"/>
          <p>“Yes, gal, you has got to mind them ar' <hi rend="italics">wimmen</hi>,” said Mr.
Peterkin to me, as he pointed toward his daughters.</p>
          <p>“Father, I do wish you would quit that vulgarism; say <hi rend="italics">girl,</hi>
not gal, and <hi rend="italics">ladies</hi>, not women.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I was never <hi rend="italics">edicated</hi>, like you.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Educated</hi> is the word.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, confound your dictionaries! Ever since that school-marm
come out from Yankee-land, these neighborhood gals talk
so big, nobody can understand 'em.”</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE YANKEE SCHOOL-MISTRESS—HER PHILOSOPHY—THE 
AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE family with whom I now found a home, consisted of
Mr. Peterkin and his two daughters, Jane and Matilda, and a
son, John, much younger than the ladies.</p>
          <p>The death of Mrs. Peterkin had occurred about three years
before I went to live with them. The girls had been very well
educated by a Miss Bradly, from Massachusetts, a spinster of
“no particular age.” From her, the Misses Peterkin learned to
set a great value upon correct and elegant language. She was
the model and instructress of the country round; for, under her
jurisdiction, nearly all the farmers' daughters had been initiated
into the mysteries of learning. Scattered about, over the
house, I used to frequently find odd leaves of school-books,
elementary portions of natural sciences, old readers, story-books,
novels, &amp;c. These I eagerly devoured; but I had to be very
secret about it, studying by dying embers, reading by moon-light,
sun-rise, &amp;c. Had I been discovered, a severe punishment
would have followed. Miss Jane used to say, “a literary negro
was disgusting, not to be tolerated.” Though she quarrelled
with the vulgar talk and bad pronunciation of her father, he was
made of too rough material to receive a polish; and, though
Miss Bradly had improved the minds of the girls, her efforts to
soften their hearts had met with no success. They were the
same harsh, cold and selfish girls that she had found them. It
was Jane's boast that she had whipped more negroes than any
other girl of her age. Matilda, though less severe, had still a
touch of the tigress.</p>
          <p>This family lived in something like “style.” They were
<pb id="browne30" n="30"/>
famed for their wealth and social position throughout the
neighborhood. The house was a low cottage structure, with large
and airy apartments; an arching piazza ran the whole length
of the building, and around its trellised balustrade the clematis
vine twined in rich luxuriance. A primrose-walk led up to the
door, and the yard blossomed like a garden, with the fairest
flowers. It was a very Paradise of homes; pity, ah pity 'twas,
that human fiends marred its beauty. There the sweet flowers
bloomed, the young birds warbled, pure springs gushed forth with
limpid joy—there truly, “All, save the spirit of man, was
divine.” The traveller often paused to admire the tasteful
arrangements of the grounds, the neat and artistic plan of the
house, and the thorough “air” of everything around. It seemed
to bespeak refined minds, and delicate, noble natures; but oh,
the flowers were no symbols of the graces of their hearts, for the
dwellers of this highly-adorned spot were people of coarse natures,
rough and cruel as barbarians. The nightly stars and the
gentle moon, the deep glory of the noontide, or the blowing of
twilight breezes over this chosen home, had no power to ennoble
or elevate their souls. Acts of diabolical cruelty and wickedness
were there perpetrated without the least pang of remorse or regret.
Whilst the white portion of the family were revelling in
luxury, the slaves were denied the most ordinary necessaries.
The cook, who prepared the nicest dainties, the most tempting
viands, had to console herself with a scanty diet, coarse enough
to shock even a beggar. What wonder, then, if the craving of
the stomach should allow her no escape from downright theft!
Who is there that could resist? Where is the honesty that could
not, under such circumstances, find an argument to justify larceny?</p>
          <p>Every evening Miss Bradly came to spend an hour or so with
them. The route from the school to her boarding-house wound
by Mr. Peterkin's residence, and the temptation to talk to the
young ladies, who were emphatically the belles of the neighborhood,
was too great for resistance. This lady was of that class
of females which we meet in every quarter of the globe,—of
<pb id="browne31" n="31"/>
perfectly kind intentions, yet without the independence necessary
for their open and free expression. Bred in the North, and
having from her infancy imbibed the spirit of its free institutions,
in her secret soul she loathed the abomination of slavery, every
pulse of her heart cried out against it, yet with a strange compliance
she lived in its midst, never once offering an objection
or an argument against it. It suited <hi rend="italics">her policy</hi> to laugh with
the pro-slavery man at the fanaticism of the Northern Abolitionist.
With a Judas-like hypocrisy, she sold her conscience for
silver; and for a mess of pottage, bartered the noble right of
free expression. 'Twas she, base renegade from a glorious cause,
who laughed loudest and repeated wholesale libels and foul aspersions
upon the able defenders of abolition—noble and generous
men, lofty philanthropists, who are willing, for the sake of
principle, to wear upon their brows the mark of social and political
ostracism! But a day is coming, a bright millennial day,
when the names of these inspired prophets shall be inscribed
proudly upon the litany of freedom; when their noble efforts
for social reform shall be told in wondering pride around the
winter's fire. Then shall their fame shine with a glory which
no Roman tradition can eclipse. Freed from calumny, the
names of Parker, Seward and Sumner, will be ranked, as they
deserve to be, with Washington, Franklin and Henry. All
glory to the American Abolitionists. Though they must now
possess their souls in patience, and bear the brand of social opprobrium,
yet will posterity accord them the meed of everlasting
honor. They, “who sow in dishonor shall be raised in glory.”
Already the watchman upon the tower has discerned the signal.
A light beameth in the East, which no man can quench. A fire
has broken forth, which needs only a breath to fan it into a
flame. The eternal law of sovereign right will vindicate itself.
In the hour of feasting and revelry the dreadful bolt of retribution
fell upon Gomorrah.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>CONVERSATION WITH MISS BRADLY—A LIGHT BREAKS THROUGH THE DARKNESS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I HAD been living with Mr. Peterkin about three years, during
which time I had frequently seen Miss Bradly. One evening
when she called (as was her custom after the adjournment of
school), she found, upon inquiry, that the young ladies had gone
out, and would not probably be back for several hours. She
looked a little disconcerted, and seemed doubtful whether she
would go home or remain. I had often observed her attentively
watching me, yet I could not interpret the look; sometimes I
thought it was of deep, earnest pity. Then it appeared only an
anxious curiosity; and as commiseration was a thing which I
seldom met with, I tried to guard my heart against anything
like hope or trust; but on this afternoon I was particularly
struck by her strange and irresolute manner. She turned several
times as if to leave, then suddenly stopped, and, looking
very earnestly at me, asked, “Did you say the girls would not
return for several hours?”</p>
          <p>Upon receiving an answer in the affirmative, she hesitated a
moment, and then inquired for Mr. Peterkin. He was also from
home, and would probably be absent for a day or two. “Is
there no white person about the place?” she asked, with some
trepidation.</p>
          <p>“No one is here but the slaves,” I replied, perhaps in a sorrowful
tone, for the word “slave” always grated upon my ear,
yet I frequently used it, in obedience to a severe and imperative
conventionality.</p>
          <p>“Well then, Ann, come and sit down near me; I want to
talk with you awhile.”</p>
          <pb id="browne33" n="33"/>
          <p>This surprised me a great deal. I scarcely knew what to do.
The very idea of sitting down to a conversation with a white
lady seemed to me the wildest improbability. A vacant stare
was the only answer I could make. Certainly, I did not dream
of her being in earnest.</p>
          <p>“Come on, Ann,” she said, coaxingly; but, seeing that my
amazement increased, she added, in a more persuasive tone,
“Don't be afraid, I am a friend to the colored race.”</p>
          <p>This seemed to me the strangest fiction. A white lady, and
yet a friend to the colored race! Oh, impossible! such condescension
was unheard of! What! she a refined woman,
with a snowy complexion, to stoop from her proud elevation to
befriend the lowly Ethiopian! Why, she could not, she dare
not! Almost stupified with amazement, I stood, with my eyes
intently fixed upon her.</p>
          <p>“Come, child,” she said, in a kind tone, and placing her hand
upon my shoulder, she endeavored to seat me beside her, “look
up,—be not ashamed, for I am truly your friend. Your downcast
look and melancholy manner have often struck me with
sorrow.”</p>
          <p>To this I could make no reply. Utterance was denied me.
My tongue clove to the roof of my month; a thick, filmy veil
gathered before my sight; and there I stood like one turned to
stone. But upon being frequently reassured by her gentle
manner and kind words, I at length controlled my emotions,
and, seating myself at her feet, awaited her communication.</p>
          <p>“Ann, you are not happy here?”</p>
          <p>I said nothing, but she understood my look.</p>
          <p>“Were you happy at home?”</p>
          <p>“I was;” and the words were scarcely audible.</p>
          <p>“Did they treat you kindly there?”</p>
          <p>“Indeed they did; and there I had a mother, and was not
lonely.”</p>
          <p>“They did not beat you?”</p>
          <p>“No, no, they did not,” and large tears gushed from my
burning eyes;—for I remembered with anguish, how many a
<pb id="browne34" n="34"/>
smarting blow had been given to me by Mr. Jones, how many
a cuff by Mr. Peterkin, and ten thousand knocks, pinches, and
tortures, by the young ladies.</p>
          <p>“Don't weep, child,” said Miss Bradley, in as soothing tone,
and she laid her arm caressingly around my neck. This kindness
was too much for my fortitude, and bursting through all
restraints I gave vent to my feelings in a violent shower of
tears. She very wisely allowed me some time for the gratification
of this luxury. I at length composed myself, and begged
her pardon for this seeming disrespect.</p>
          <p>“But ah, my dear lady, you have spoken so kindly to me
that I forgot myself.”</p>
          <p>“No apology, my child, I tell you again that I am your
friend, and with me you can be perfectly free. Look upon me
as a sister; but now that your excited feelings have become
allayed, let me ask you why your master sold you?”</p>
          <p>I explained to her that it was necessary to the equal division
of the estate that some of the slaves should be sold, and that I
was among the number.</p>
          <p>“A bad institution is this one of slavery. What fearful
entailments of anguish! Manage it as the most humane will, or
can, still it has horrible results. Witness your separation from
your mother. Did these thoughts never occur to?”</p>
          <p>I looked surprised, but dared not tell her that often had
vague doubts of the justice of slavery crossed my mind. Ah,
too much I feared the lash, and I answered only by a mournful
look of assent.</p>
          <p>“Ann, did you never hear of the Abolition Society?”</p>
          <p>I shook my head. She paused, as if doubtful of the propriety
of making a disclosure; but at length the better principle
triumphed, and she said, “There is in the Northern States an
organization which devotes its energies and very life to the
cause of the slave. They wish to abolish the shameful system,
and make you and all your persecuted race as free and happy
as the whites.”</p>
          <p>“Does there really exist such a society; or is it only a wild
<pb id="browne35" n="35"/>
fable that you tell me, for the purpose of allaying my present
agony?”</p>
          <p>“No, child; I do not deceive you. This noble and beneficent
society really lives; but it does not, I regret to say, flourish as
it should.”</p>
          <p>“And why?” I asked, whilst a new wonder was fastening on
my mind.</p>
          <p>“Because,” she answered, “the larger portion of the whites
are mean and avaricious enough to desire, for the sake of pecuniary
aggrandizement, the enslavement of a race, whom the
force of education and hereditary prejudice have taught them to
regard as their own property.”</p>
          <p>I did but dimly conceive her meaning. A slow light was
breaking through my cloudy brain, kindling and inflaming hopes
that now shine like beacons over the far waste of memory.
Should I, could I, ever be <hi rend="italics">free</hi>? Oh, bright and glorious dream!
how it did sparkle in my soul, and cheer me through the lonely
hours of bondage! This hope, this shadow of a hope, shone like
a mirage far away upon the horizon of a clouded future.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly looked thoughtfully at me, as if watching the
effect of her words; but she could not see that the seed which
she had planted, perhaps carelessly, was destined to fructify
and flourish through the coming seasons. I longed to pour out
my heart to her; for she had, by this ready “sesame,” unlocked
its deepest chambers. I dared not unfold even to her the wild
dreams and strange hopes which I was indulging.</p>
          <p>I spied Melinda coming up, and signified to Miss Bradly
that it would be unsafe to prolong the conversation, and quickly
she departed; not, however, without reassuring me of the interest
which she felt in my fate.</p>
          <p>“What was Miss Emily Bradly talking wid you 'bout?” demanded
Melinda, in a surly tone.</p>
          <p>“Nothing that concerns you,” I answered.</p>
          <p>“Well, but you'll see that it consarns yerself, when I goes
and tells Masser on you.”</p>
          <p>“What can you tell him on me?”</p>
          <pb id="browne36" n="36"/>
          <p>“Oh, I knows, I hearn you talking wid dat ar' woman;” and
she gave a significant leer of her eye, and lolled her tongue out
of her mouth, à la mad dog.</p>
          <p>I was much disturbed lest she had heard the conversation,
and should make a report of it, which would redound to the disadvantage
of my new friend. I went about my usual duties
with a slow and heavy heart; still, sometimes, like a star shining
through clouds, was that little bright hope of liberty.</p>

            <p>A FASHIONABLE TEA-TABLE—TABLE-TALK—AUNT POLLY'S
EXPERIENCE—THE OVERSEER'S AUTHORITY—THE
WHIPPING-POST—TRANSFIGURING POWER OF DIVINE FAITH.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THAT evening when the family returned, I was glad to find the
young ladies in such an excellent humor. It was seldom Miss
Jane, whose peculiar property I was, ever gave me a kind word;
and I was surprised on this occasion to hear her say, in a some-what
gentle tone:</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann, come here, I want you to look very nice to-night,
and wait on the table in style, for I am expecting company;”
and, with a sort of half good-natured smile, she tossed an old
faded neck-ribbon to me, saying,</p>
          <p>“There is a present for you.” I bowed low, and made a
respectful acknowledgement of thanks, which she received in an
unusually complacent manner.</p>
          <p>Immediately I began to make arrangements for supper, and
to get myself in readiness, which was no small matter, as my
scanty wardrobe furnished no scope for the exercise of taste.
In looking over my trunk, I found a white cotton apron, which
could boast of many mice-bites and moth-workings; but with a
needle and thread I soon managed to make it appear decent,
and, combing my hair as neatly as possible, and tying the ribbon
which Miss Jane had given me around it, I gave the finishing
touch to my toilette, and then set about arranging the table.
I assorted the tea-board, spoons, cups, saucers, &amp;c., placed a
nice damask napkin at each seat, and turned down the round
little plates of white French china. The silver forks and
ivory-handled knives were laid round the table in precise order.
This done, I surveyed my work with an air of pride. Smiling
<pb id="browne38" n="38"/>
complacently to myself, I proceeded to Miss Jane's room, to
request her to come and look at it, and express her opinion.</p>
          <p>On reaching her apartment, I found her dressed with great
care, in a pink silk, with a rich lace berthé, and pearl ornaments.
Her red hair was oiled until its fiery hue had darkened
into a becoming auburn, and the metallic polish of the French
powder had effectually concealed the huge freckles which
spotted her checks.</p>
          <p>Dropping a low courtesy, I requested her to come with me to
the dining-room. and inspect my work. With a smile, she followed,
and upon examination, seemed well pleased.</p>
          <p>“Now, Ann, if you do well in officiating, it will be well for
you; but if you fail, if you make one mistake, you had better
never been born, for,” and she grasped me strongly by the
shoulder, “I will flay you alive; you shall ache and smart in
every limb and nerve.”</p>
          <p>Terror-stricken at this threat, I made the most earnest
promises to exert my very best energies. Yet her angry manner
and threatening words so unnerved me, that I was not able
to go on with the work in the same spirit in which I had begun,
for we all know what a paralysis fear is to exertion.</p>
          <p>I stepped out on the balcony for some purpose, and there,
standing at the end of the gallery, but partially concealed by
the clematis blossoms, stood Miss Jane, and a tall gentleman
was leaning over the railing talking very earnestly to her. In
that uncertain light I could see the flash of her eye and the
crimson glow of her check. She was twirling and tearing to
pieces, petal by petal, a beautiful rose which she held in her
hand. Here, I thought here is happiness; this woman loves
and is beloved. She has tasted of that one drop which sweetens
the whole cup of existence. Oh, what a thing it is to be <hi rend="italics">free</hi>—
free and independent, with power and privilege to go whithersoever
you choose, with no cowardly fear, no dread of espionage,
with the right to hold your head proudly aloft, and return
glance for glance, not shrink and cower before the white man's
look, as we poor slaves <hi rend="italics">must</hi> do. But not many moments could
<pb id="browne39" n="39"/>
I thus spend in thought, and well, perhaps, it was for me that
duty broke short all such unavailing regrets.</p>
          <p>Hastening back to the dining-room, I gave another inquiring
look at the table, fearful that some article had been omitted.
Satisfying myself on this point, I moved on to the kitchen,
where Aunt Polly was busy frying a chicken.</p>
          <p>“Here, child,” she exclaimed, “look in thar at them biscuits.
See is they done. Oh, that's prime, browning beautiful-like,”
she said, as I drew from the stove a pan of nice biscuits, “and
this ar' chicken is mighty nice. Oh, but it will make the young
gemman smack his lips,” and wiping the perspiration from her
sooty brow, she drew a long breath, and seated herself upon a
broken stool.</p>
          <p>“Wal, this ar' nigger is tired. I's bin cooking now this
twelve years, and never has I had 'mission' to let my old man
come to see me, or I to go see him.”</p>
          <p>The children, with eyes wide open, gathered round Aunt
Polly to hear a recital of her wrongs. “Laws-a-marcy, sights
I's seen in my times, and often it 'pears like I's lost my senses.
I tells you, yous only got to look at this ar' back to know what
I's went through.” Hereupon she exposed her back and arms,
which were frightfully scarred.</p>
          <p>“This ar' scar,” and she pointed to a very deep one on her
left shoulder, “Masser gib me kase I cried when he sold my
oldest son; poor Jim, he was sent down the river, and I've
never hearn from him since.” She wiped a stray tear from her
old eyes.</p>
          <p>“Oh me! 'tis long time since my eyes hab watered, and now
these tears do feel so quare. Poor Jim is down the river, Johnny
is dead, and Lucy is sold somewhar, so I have neither chick
nor child. What's I got to live fur?”</p>
          <p>This brought fresh to my mind recollections of my own
mother's grief, when she was forced to give me up, and I could
not restrain my tears.</p>
          <p>“What fur you crying, child?” she asked. “It puts me in
mind ov my poor little Luce, she used to cry this way whenever
<pb id="browne40" n="40"/>
anything happened to me. Oh, many is the time she screamed
if master struck me.”</p>
          <p>“Poor Aunt Polly,” I said, as I walked up to her side, “I do
pity you. I will be kind to you; I'll be your daughter.”</p>
          <p>She looked up with a wild stare, and with a deep earnestness
seized hold of my out-stretched hand; then dropping it suddenly,
she murmured,</p>
          <p>“No, no, you ain't my darter, you comes to me with saft
words, but you is jest like Lindy and all the rest of 'em; you'll go
to the house and tell tales to the white folks on me. No, I'll not
trust any of you.”</p>
          <p>Springing suddenly into the room, with his eyes flaming came
Jones, and, cracking his whip right and left, he struck each of
the listening group. I retreated hastily to an extreme corner
of the kitchen, where, unobserved by him, I could watch the
affray.</p>
          <p>“You devilish old wretch, Polly, what are you gabbling and
snubbling here about? Up with your old hide, and git yer
supper ready. Don't you know thar is company in the house?”
and here he gave another sharp cut of the whip, which descended
upon that poor old scarred back with a cruel force, and
tore open old cicatriced wounds. The victim did not scream,
'nor shrink, nor murmur; but her features resumed their wonted
hard, encrusted expression, and, rising up from her seat, she
went on with her usual work.</p>
          <p>“Now, cut like the wind,” he added, as he flourished his whip
in the direction of the young blacks, who had been the interested
auditors of Aunt Polly's hair-breadth escapes, and quick as
lightning they were off to their respective quarters, whilst I
proceeded to assist Aunt Polly in dishing up the supper.</p>
          <p>“This chicken,” said I, in a tone of encouragement, “is beautifully cooked. How brown it is, and oh, what a delightful
savory odor.”</p>
          <p>“I'll be bound the white folks will find fault wid it. Nobody
ever did please Miss Jane. Her is got some of the most perkuler
notions 'bout cookin'. I knows she'll be kommin' out
<pb id="browne41" n="41"/>
here, makin' a fuss 'long wid me 'bout dis same supper,” and
the old woman shook her head knowingly.</p>
          <p>I made no reply, for I feared the re-appearance of Mr. Jones,
and too often and too painfully had I felt the sting of his lash,
to be guilty of any wanton provocation of its severity.</p>
          <p>Silently, but with bitter thoughts curdling my life-blood, did
I arrange the steaming cookies upon the luxurious board, and
then, with a deferential air, sought the parlor, and bade them
walk out to tea.</p>
          <p>I found Miss Jane seated near a fine rosewood piano, and standing
beside her was a gentleman, the same whom I had observed
with her upon the verandah. Miss Matilda was at the window,
looking out upon the western heaven. I spoke in a soft tone,
asking them, “Please walk out to tea.” The young gentleman
rose, and offered his arm to Miss Jane, which was graciously
accepted, and Miss Matilda followed. I swung the dining-room
door open with great pomp and ceremony, for I knew that anything
showy or grand, either in the furniture of a house or the
deportment of a servant, would be acceptable to Miss Jane.
Fashion, or style, was the god of her worship, and she often declared
that her principal objection to the negro, was his great
want of style in thought and action. She was not deep enough
to see, that, fathoms down below the surface, in all the crudity of
ignorance, lay a stratum of this same style, so much worshipped
by herself. Does not the African, in his love of gaud, show, and
tinsel, his odd and grotesque decorations of his person, exhibit a
love of style? But she was not philosopher enough to see that
this was a symptom of the same taste, though ungarnished and
semi-barbarous.</p>
          <p>The supper passed off very handsomely, so far as my part
was concerned. I carried the cups round on a silver salver to
each one; served them with chicken, plied them with cakes,
confections, &amp;c., and interspersed my performance with innumerable
courtesies, bows and scrapes.</p>
          <p>“Ah,” said Miss Jane to the gentleman, “ah, Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic>,
you have visited us at the wrong season; you should be here
<pb id="browne42" n="42"/>
later in the autumn, or earlier in the summer,” and she gave one
of her most benign smiles.</p>
          <p>“Any season is pleasant here,” replied Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic>, as he
held the wing of a chicken between his thumb and fore-finger.
Miss Jane simpered and looked down; and Miss Matilda arched
her brows and gave a significant side-long glance, toward her
sister.</p>
          <p>“Here, you cussed yallow gal,” cried Mr. Peterkin, in a rage,
“take this split spoon away and fetch me a fork what I ken
use. These darned things is only made for grand folks,” and
he held the silver fork to me. Instantly I replaced it with a
steel one.</p>
          <p>“Now this looks something like. We only uses them ar'
other ones when we has company, so I suppose, Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic>,
the girl sot the table in this grand way bekase you is here.”</p>
          <p>No thunder-cloud was ever darker than Miss Jane's brow.
It gathered, and deepened, and darkened like a thick-coming
tempest, whilst lightning blazed from her eye.</p>
          <p>“Father,” and she spoke through her clenched teeth, “what
makes you affect this horrid vulgarity? and how can you be so
very <hi rend="italics">idiosyncratic</hi>” (this was a favorite word with her), as to
say you never use them? Ever since I can remember, silver
forks have been used in our family; but,” and she smiled as she
said it, “Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic>, father thinks it is truly a Kentucky
fashion, and in keeping with the spirit of the early settlers, to
rail out against fashion and style.”</p>
          <p>To this explanation Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic> bowed blandly. “Ah,
yes, I do admire your father's honest independence.”</p>
          <p>“I'll jist tell you how it is, young man, my gals has bin
better edicated than their pappy, and they pertends to be mighty
'shamed of me, bekase I has got no larnin'; but I wants to ax
'em one question, whar did the money kum from that give 'em
thar larning?” and with a triumphant force he brought his hard
fist down on the table, knocking off with his elbow a fine cut-glass
tumbler, which was shivered to atoms.</p>
          <p>“Thar now,” he exclaimed, “another piece of yer cussed
<pb id="browne43" n="43"/>
frippery is breaked to bits. What did you put it here fur? I
wants that big tin-cup that I drinks out of when nobody's
here.”</p>
          <p>“Father, father,” said Miss Matilda, who until now had kept
an austere silence, “why will you persist in this outrageous
talk? Why will you mortify and torture us in this cruel way?”
and she burst into a flood of angry tears.</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't blubber about it, Tildy, I didn't mean to hurt
your feelin's.”</p>
          <p>Pretty soon after this, the peace of the table being broken up,
the ladies and Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic> adjourned to the parlor, whilst
Melinda, or Lindy, as she was called, and I set about clearing
off the table, washing up the dishes, and gathering and counting
over the forks and spoons.</p>
          <p>Now, though the young ladies made great pretensions to
elegance and splendor of living, yet were they vastly economical
when there was no company present. The silver was all
carefully laid away, and locked up in the lower drawer of an
old-fashioned bureau, and the family appropriated a commoner
article to their every-day use; but let a solitary guest appear,
and forthwith the napkins and silver would be displayed, and
treated by the ladies as though it was quite a usual thing.</p>
          <p>“Now, Ann,” said 'Lindy “you wash the dishes, and I'll count
the spoons and forks.”</p>
          <p>To this I readily assented, for I was anxious to get clear of
such a responsible office as counting and assorting the silver
ware.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin, or master, as we called him, sat near by, smoking
his cob-pipe in none the best humor; for the recent encounter
at the supper-table was by no means calculated to improve his
temper.</p>
          <p>“See here, gals,” he cried in a tone of thunder, “if thar be
one silver spoon or fork missin', yer hides shall pay for the loss.”</p>
          <p>“Laws, master, I'll be 'tickler enough,” replied Lindy, as she
smiled, more in terror than pleasure.</p>
          <p>“Wal,” he said, half aloud, “whar is the use of my darters
<pb id="browne44" n="44"/>
taking on in the way they does? Jist look at the sight o' money
that has bin laid out in that ar' tom-foolery.”</p>
          <p>This was a sort of soliloquy spoken in a tone audible enough
to be distinct to us.</p>
          <p>He drew his cob-pipe from his mouth, and a huge volume of
smoke curled round his head, and filled the room with the aroma
of tobacco.</p>
          <p>“Now,” he continued, “they does not treat me wid any
politeness. They thinks they knows a power more than I does;
but if they don't cut their cards square, I'll cut them short of a
nigger or two, and make John all the richer by it.”</p>
          <p>Lindy cut her eye knowingly at this, and gave me rather a
strong nudge with her elbow.</p>
          <p>“Keep still thar, gals, and don't rattle them cups and sassers
so powerful hard.”</p>
          <p>By this time Lindy had finished the assortment of the silver,
and had carefully stowed it away in a willow-basket, ready to
be delivered to Miss Jane, and thence consigned to the drawer,
where it would remain in <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">statu quo</foreign></hi> until the timely advent of
another guest.</p>
          <p>“Now,” she said, “I am ready to wipe the dishes, while you
wash.”</p>
          <p>Thereupon I handed her a saucer, which, in her carelessness,
she let slip from her hand, and it fell upon the floor, and there,
with great consternation, I beheld it lying, shattered to fragments.
Mr. Peterkin sprang to his feet, glad of an excuse to vent his
temper upon some one.</p>
          <p>“Which of you cussed wretches did this?”</p>
          <p>“'Twas Ann, master! She let it fall afore I got my hand on it.</p>
          <p>Ere I had time to vindicate myself from the charge, his iron
arm felled me to the floor, and his hoof-like foot was placed upon
my shrinking chest.</p>
          <p>“You d—n yallow hussy, does you think I buys such expensive
chany-ware for you to break up in this ar' way? No, you
'bominable wench, I'll have revenge out of your saffer'n hide.
Here, Lindy, fetch me that cowhide.”</p>
          <pb id="browne45" n="45"/>
          <p>“Mercy, master, mercy,” I cried, when he had removed his
foot from my breast, and my breath seemed to come again. “Oh,
listen to me; it was not I who broke the saucer, it was only an
accident; but oh, in God's name, have mercy on me and Lindy.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I'll tache you what marcy is. Here, quick, some of
you darkies, bring me a rope and light. I'm goin' to take this
gal to the whippin'-post.”</p>
          <p>This overcame me, for, though I had often been cruelly beaten,
yet had I escaped the odium of the “post;” and now for what I
had not done, and for a thing which, at the worst, was but an
accident, to bear the disgrace and the pain of a public whipping,
seemed to me beyond endurance. I fell on my knees before
him:</p>
          <p>“Oh, master, please pardon me; spare me this time. I have
got a half-dollar that Master Edward gave me when you bought
me, I will give you that to pay for the saucer, but please do not
beat me.”</p>
          <p>With a wild, fiendish grin, he caught me by the hair and
swung me round until I half-fainted with pain.</p>
          <p>“No, you wretch, I'll git my satisfaction out of yer body yit,
and I'll be bound, afore this night's work is done, yer yallow
hide will be well marked.”</p>
          <p>A deadly, cold sensation crept over me, and a feeling as of
crawling adders seemed possessing my nerves. With all my
soul pleading in my eyes I looked at Mr. Peterkin; but one
glance of his fiendish face made my soul quail with even a newer
horror. I turned my gaze from him to Jones, but the red glare
of a demon lighted up his frantic eye, and the words of a profane
bravo were on his lips. From him I turned to poor, hardened,
obdurate old Nace, but he seemed to be linked and leagued with
my torturers.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lindy,” I cried, as she came up with a bunch of cord
in her hand, “be kind, tell the truth, maybe master will forgive
you. You are an older servant, better known and valued in the
family. Oh, let your heart triumph. Speak the truth, and free
me from the torture that awaits me. Oh, think of me, away off
<pb id="browne46" n="46"/>
here, separated from my Mother, with no friend. Oh, pity me,
and do acknowledge that you broke it.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you is crazy, you knows dat I never touched de
sacer,” and she laughed heartily.</p>
          <p>“Come along wid you all. Now far fun,” cried Nace.</p>
          <p>“Hold your old jaw,” said Jones, and he raised his whip.
Nace cowered like a criminal, and made some polite speech to
“Massa Jones,” and Mr. Peterkin possessed himself of the rope
which Lindy had brought.</p>
          <p>“Now hold yer hands here,” he said to me.</p>
          <p>For one moment I hesitated. I could not summon courage to
offer my hands. It was the only resistance that I had ever
dared to make. A severe blow from the overseer's riding-whip
reminded me that I was still a slave, and dared have no will
save that of my master. This blow, which struck the back of
my head, laid me half-lifeless upon the floor. Whilst in this
condition old Nace, at the command of his master, bound the
rope tightly around my crossed arms and dragged me to the
place of torment.</p>
          <p>The motion or exertion of being pulled along over the ground,
restored me to full consciousness. With a haggard eye I looked
up to the still blue heaven, where the holy stars yet held their
silent vigil; and the serene moon moved on in her starry track,
never once heeding the dire cruelty, over which her pale beam
shed its friendly light. “Oh,” thought I, “is there no mercy
throned on high? Are there no spirits in earth, air, or sky, to
lend me their gracious influence? Does God look down with
kindness upon injustice like this? Or, does He, too, curse me in
my sorrow, and in His wrath turn away His glorious face from
my supplication, and say ‘a servant of servants shalt thou be?’ ”
These wild, rebellious thoughts only crossed my mind; they
did not linger there. No, like the breath-stain upon the polished
surface of the mirror, they only soiled for a moment the shining
faith which in my soul reflected the perfect goodness of that God
who never forgets the humblest of His children, and who makes
no distinction of color or of race. The consoling promise, “He
<pb id="browne47" n="47"/>
chasteneth whom He loveth,” flashed through my brain with its
blessed assurance, and reconciled me to a heroic endurance.
Far away I strained my gaze to the starry heaven, and I could
almost fancy the sky breaking asunder and disclosing the wondrous
splendors which were beheld by the rapt Apostle on the
isle of Patmos! Oh, transfiguring power of faith! Thou hast
a wand more potent than that of fancy, and a vision brighter
than the dreams of enchantment! What was it that reconciled
me to the horrible tortures which were awaiting me? Surely,
'twas faith alone that sustained me. The present scene faded
away from my vision, and, in fancy, I stood in the lonely garden
of Gethsemane. I saw the darkness and gloom that overshadowed
the earth, when, deserted by His disciples, our blessed
Lord prayed alone. I heard the sighs and groans that burst
from his tortured breast. I saw the bloody sweat, as prostrate
on the earth he lay in the tribulation of mortal agony. I saw
the inhuman captors, headed by one of His chosen twelve, come
to seize his sacred person. I saw his face uplifted to the mournful
heavens, as He prayed to His Father to remove the cup of
sorrow. I saw Him bound and led away to death, without a
friend to solace Him. Through the various stages of His awful
passion, even to the Mount of Crucifixion, to the bloody and
sacred Calvary, I followed my Master. I saw Him nailed to
the cross, spit upon, vilified and abused, with the thorny crown
pressed upon His brow. I heard the rabble shout; then I saw
the solemn mystery of Nature, that did attestation to the awful
fact that a fiendish work had been done and the prophecy fulfilled.
The vail of the great temple was rent, the sun overcast,
and the moon turned to blood; and in my ecstasy of passion, I
could have shouted, Great is Jesus of Nazareth!! Then I
beheld Him triumphing over the powers of darkness and death,
when, robed in the white garments of the grave, He broke
through the rocky sepulchre, and stood before the affrighted
guards. His work was done, the propitiation had been made,
and he went to His Father. This same Jesus, whom the civilized
world now worship as their Lord, was once lowly, outcast,
<pb id="browne48" n="48"/>
and despised; born of the most hated people of the world,
belonging to a race despised alike by Jew and Gentile; laid in
the manger of a stable at Bethlehem, with no earthly possessions,
having not whereon to lay His weary head; buffetted, spit
upon; condemned by the high priests and the doctors of law;
branded as an impostor, and put to an ignominious death, with
every demonstration of public contempt; crucified between two
thieves; this Jesus is worshipped now by those who wear purple
and fine linen. The class which once scorned Him, now offer
at His shrine frankincense and myrrh; but, in their adoration
of the despised Nazarene, they never remember that He has
declared, not once, but many times, that the poor and the lowly
are His people. “Forasmuch as you did it unto one of these
you did it unto me.” Then let the African trust and hope on—
let him still weep and pray in Gethsemane, for a cloud hangs
round about him, and when he prays for the removal of this
cup of bondage, let him remember to ask, as his blessed Master
did, “Thy will, oh Father, and not our own, be done;” still
trust in Him who calmed the raging tempest; trust in Jesus of
Nazareth! Look beyond the cross, to Christ.</p>
          <p>These thoughts had power to cheer; and, fortified by faith
and religion, the trial seemed to me easy to bear. One prayer
murmured, and my soul said to my body, “pass under the
rod;” and the cup which my Father has given me to drink
must be drained, even to the dregs.</p>
          <p>In this state of mind, with a moveless eye I looked upon the
whipping-post, which loomed up before me like an ogre.</p>
          <p>This was a quadri-lateral post, about eight feet in height,
having iron clasps on two opposing sides, in which the wrists
and ankles were tightly secured.</p>
          <p>“Now, Lindy,” cried Jones, “jerk off that gal's rigging, I am
anxious to put some marks on her yellow skin.”</p>
          <p>I knew that resistance was vain; so I submitted to have my
clothes torn from my body; for modesty, so much commended
in a white woman, is in a negro pronounced affectation.</p>
          <pb id="browne49" n="49"/>
          <p>Jones drew down a huge cow-hide, which he dipped in a barrel
of brine that stood near the post.</p>
          <p>“I guess this will sting,” he said, as he flourished the whip
toward me.</p>
          <p>“Leave that thin slip on me, Lindy,” I ventured to ask; for
I dreaded the exposure of my person even more than the
whipping.</p>
          <p>“None of your cussed impedence; strip off naked. What
is a nigger's hide more than a dog's?” cried Jones. Lindy and
Nace tore the last article of clothing from my back. I felt my
soul shiver and shudder at this; but what could I do?  <hi rend="italics">I could
pray</hi>—thank God, I could pray!</p>
          <p>I then submitted to have Nace clasp the iron cuffs around
my hands and ankles, and there I stood, a revolting spectacle.
With what misery I listened to obscene and ribald jests from
my master and his overseer!</p>
          <p>“Now, Jones,” said Mr. Peterkin, “I want to give that gal the
first lick, which will lay the flesh open to the bone.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Mr. Peterkin, here is the whip; now you can lay on.”</p>
          <p>“No, confound your whip; I wants that cow-hide, and here,
let me dip it well into the brine. I want to give her a real good
warmin'; one that she'll 'member for a long time.”</p>
          <p>During this time I had remained motionless. My heart was
lifted to God in silent prayer. Oh, shall I, can I, ever forget
that scene? There, in the saintly stillness of the summer night,
where the deep, o'ershadowing heavens preached a sermon of
peace, there I was loaded with contumely, bound hand and foot
in irons, with jeering faces around, vulgar eyes glaring on my
uncovered body, and two inhuman men about to lash me to the
bone.</p>
          <p>The first lick from Mr.Peterkin laid my back open. I writhed,
I wrestled; but blow after blow descended, each harder than
the preceding one. I shrieked, I screamed, I pleaded, I prayed,
but there was no mercy shown me. Mr. Peterkin having fully
gratified and quenched his spleen, turned to Mr. Jones, and
said, “Now is yer turn; you can beat her as much as you
<pb id="browne50" n="50"/>
please, only jist leave a bit o' life in her, is all I cares
for.”</p>
          <p>“Yes; I'll not spile her for the market; but I does want to
take a little of the d—d pride out of her.”</p>
          <p>“Now, boys”—for by this time all the slaves on the place,
save Aunt Polly, had assembled round the post—you will see
what a true stroke I ken make; but darn my buttons if I
doesn't think Mr. Peterkin has drawn all the blood.”</p>
          <p>So saying, Jones drew back the cow-hide at arm's length,
and, making a few evolutions with his body, took what he called
“sure aim.” I closed my eyes in terror. More from the terrible
pain, than from the frantic shoutings of the crowd, I knew
that Mr. Jones had given a lick that he called “true blue.”
The exultation of the negroes in Master Jones' triumph was
scarcely audible to my ears; for a cold, clammy sensation was
stealing over my frame; my breath was growing feebler and
feebler, and a soft melody, as of lulling summer fountains, was
gently sounding in my ears; and, as if gliding away on a moonbeam,
I passed from all consciousness of pain. A sweet oblivion,
like that sleep which announces to the wearied, fever-sick patient,
that his hour of rest has come, fell upon me! It was not a
dreamful sensibility, filled with the chaos of fragmentry visions,
but a rest where the mind, nay, the very soul, seemed to
sleep with the body.</p>
          <p>How long this stupor lasted I am unable to say; but when
I awoke, I was lying on a rough bed, a face dark, haggard,
scarred and worn, was bending over me. Disfigured as was that
visage, it was pleasant to me, for it was human. I opened my
eyes, then closed them languidly, re-opened them, then closed
them again.</p>
          <p>“Now, chile, I thinks you is a leetle better,” said the dark-faced
woman, whom I recognized as Aunt Polly; but I was
too weak, too wandering in mind, to talk, and I closed my eyes
and slept again.</p>

MIRACULOUS RETURN TO LIFE—THE MASTER'S AFFRAY WITH
THE OVERSEER.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>WHEN I awoke (for I was afterwards told by my good nurse
that I had slept four days), I was lying on the same rude bed;
but a cool, clear sensation overspread my system. I had full
and active possession of my mental faculties. I rose and sat
upright in the bed, and looked around me. It was the deep
hour of night. A little iron lamp was upon the hearth, and,
for want of a supply of oil, the wick was burning low, flinging
a red glare through the dismal room. Upon a broken stool sat
Aunt Polly, her head resting upon her breast, in what nurses
call a “stolen nap.” Amy and three other children were
sleeping in a bed opposite me.</p>
          <p>In a few moments I was able to recall the whole of the
scenes through which I had passed, while consciousness
remained; and I raised my eyes to God in gratitude for my
partial deliverance from pain and suffering. Very softly I stole
from my bed, and, wrapping an old coverlet round my shoulders,
opened the door, and looked out upon the clear, star-light
night. Of the vague thoughts that passed through my mind I
will not now speak, though they were far from pleasant or
consolatory.</p>
          <p>The fresh night air, which began to have a touch of the
frost of the advancing autumn, blew cheerily in the room, and
it fell with an awakening power upon the brow of Aunt Polly.</p>
          <p>“Law, chile, is dat you stannin' in de dor? What for you
git up out en yer warm bed, and go stand in the night-ar?<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Because I feel so well, and this pleasant air seems to brace
my frame, and encourage my mind.”</p>
          <pb id="browne52" n="52"/>
          <p>“But sure you had better take to your bed again; you hab
had a mighty bad time ob it.”</p>
          <p>“How long have I been sick? It all seems to me like a
horrible dream, from which I have been suddenly and
pleasantly aroused.”</p>
          <p>As I said this, Aunt Polly drew me from the door, and
closing it, she bade me go to bed.</p>
          <p>“No, indeed, I cannot sleep. I feel wide awake, and if I
only had someone to talk to me, I could sit up all night.”</p>
          <p>“Well, bress your heart, I'll talk wid you smack, till de
rise ob day,” she said, in such a kind, good-natured tone, that I
was surprised, for I had regarded her only as an ill-natured,
miserable beldame.</p>
          <p>Seating myself on a ricketty stool beside her, I prepared for
a long conversation.</p>
          <p>“Tell me what has happened since I have been sick?” I
said. “Where are Miss Jane and Matilda? and where is the
young gentleman who supped with them on that awful
night?”</p>
          <p>“Bress you, honey, but 'twas an awful night. Dis ole nigger
will neber forget it long as she libs;” and she bent her
head upon her poor old worn hands, and by the pale, blue
flicker of the lamp, I could discern the rapidly-falling tears.</p>
          <p>“What,” thought I, “and this hardened, wretched old woman
can weep for me! Her heart is not all ossified if she can
forget her own bitter troubles, and weep for mine.”</p>
          <p>This knowledge was painful, and yet joyful to me. Who of
us can refuse sympathy? Who does not want it, no matter at
what costly price? Does it not seem like dividing the burden,
when we know that there is another who will weep for us?
I threw my arms round Aunt Polly. I tightly strained that
decayed and revolting form to my breast, and I <sic corr="only">inly</sic> prayed
that some young heart might thus rapturously go forth, in
blessings to my mother. This evidence of affection did not
surprise Aunt Polly, nor did she return my embrace; but a
deep, hollow sigh, burst from her full heart, and I knew that
<pb id="browne53" n="53"/>
memory was far away—that, in fancy, she was with her
children, her loved and lost.</p>
          <p>“Come now,” said I, soothingly, “tell me all about it. How
did I suffer? What was done for me? Where is master?” and I shuddered, 
as I mentioned the name of my horrible persecutor.</p>
          <p>“Oh, chile, when Masser Jones was done a-beatin' ob yer,
dey all ob 'em tought you was dead; den Masser got orful
skeard. He cussed and swore, and shook his fist in de
oberseer's face, and sed he had kilt you, and dat he was gwine
to law wid him 'bout de 'struction ob his property. Den Masser
Jones he swar a mighty heap, and tell Masser he dar' him to go
to law bout it. Den Miss Jane and Tilda kum out, and commenced
cryin', and fell to 'busin' Masser Jones, kase Miss Jane
say she want to go to de big town, and take you long wid her
fur lady's maid. Den Mr. Jones fell to busen ob her, and den
Masser and him clinched, and fought, and fought like two big
black dogs. Den Masser Jones sticked his great big knife in
Masser's side, and Masser fell down, and den we all tought he
was clar gone. Den away Maser Jones did run, and nobody
dared take arter him, for he had a loaded pistol and a big
knife. Den we all on us, de, men and wimmin folks both,
grabbed up Masser, and lifted him in de house, and put him on
de bed. Den Jake, he started off fur de doctor, while Miss
Jane and Tilda 'gan to fix Masser's cut side. Law, bress your
heart, but thar he laid wid his big form stretched out just as
helpless as a baby. His face was as white as a ghost, and his
eyes shot right tight up. Law bress you, but I tought his time
hab kum den. Well, Lindy and de oder wimmin was a helpin'
ob Miss Jane and Tildy, so I jist tought I would go and look
arter yer body. Thar you was, still tied to de post, all kivered
with blood. I was mighty 'feared ob you; but den I tought
you had been so perlite, and speaked so kind to me, dat I
would take kare ob yer body; so I tuck you down and went
wid you to de horse-trough, and dere I poured some cold
water ober yer, so as to wash away de clotted blood. Den de
<pb id="browne54" n="54"/>
cold water sorter 'vived you, and yer cried out ‘oh, me!’ Wal
dat did skeer me, and I let you drap right down in de trough,
and de way dis nigger did run, fur de life ob her. Well, as I
git back I met Jake, who had kum back wid de doctor, and I
cried out, ‘Oh Jake, de spirit ob Ann done speaked to me!’ ‘Now, Polly,’ says he, ‘do hush your nonsense, you does
know dat Ann is done cold dead.’ ‘Well Jake,’ says I, ‘I tuck her down frum de post, and tuck her to the trough to wash her,
and tought I'd fix de body out right nice, in de best close dat
she had. Well, jist as I got de water on it, somping hollowed
out, ‘oh me!’ so mournful like, dat it 'peared to me it kum out
ob de ground.</p>
          <p>“ ‘What fur den you do?’ says Jake. ‘Why, to be sure, I lef it right dar, and run as fas' as my feet would carry me.’ </p>
          <p>“By dis time de house was full ob de neigbbors; all hab
collected in de house, fur de news dat Masser was kilt jist fly
trough de neighborhood. Miss Bradly hearn in de house 'bout
de 'raculous 'pearance ob de sperit, and she kum up to me, and
say ‘Polly, whar is de body of Ann?’ ‘Laws, Miss Bradly, it
is out in de trough, I won't go agin nigh to it.’ </p>
          <p>“ ‘Well,’ say she, ‘where is Jake? let him kum along wid me.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘What, you ain't gwine nigh it?’ I asked.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Yes I is gwine right up to it,’ she say, ‘kase I knows thar is life in it.’ Well this sorter holpd me up, so I said, ‘well I'll
go too.’ So we tuck Jake, and Miss Bradly walked long wid
us to de berry spot, and dar you was a settin up in de water ob
de trough where I seed you; it skeered me worse den eber, so
I fell right down on de ground, and began to pray to de Lord to
hab marcy on us all; but Miss Bradly (she is a quare woman)
walked right up to you, and spoke to you.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Laws,’ says Jake, ‘jist hear dat ar' woman talking wid a sperit,’ and down he fell, and went to callin on de Angel
Gabriel to kum and holp him.</p>
          <p>“Fust ting I knowed, Miss Bradly was a rollin' her shawl round
yer body, and axed you to walk out ob de trough.</p>
          <p>“Well, tinks I, dese am quare times when a stone-dead nigger
<pb id="browne55" n="55"/>
gits up and walks agin like a live one. Well, widout any help
from us, Miss Bradly led you 'long into dis cabin. I followed
arter. After while she kind o' 'suaded me you was a livin'. Den
I helped her wash you, and got her some goose-greese, and we
rubbed you all ober, from your head to yer feet, and den you
kind ob fainted away, and I began to run off; but Miss Bradly
say you only swoon, and she tuck a little glass vial out ob her
pocket, and held it to yer nose, and dis bring you to agin.
After while you fell off to sleep, and Miss Bradly bringed de
Doctor out ob de house to look at you. Well, he feel ob yor
wrist, put his ear down to yer breast, den say, ‘may be wid
care she will git well, but she hab been powerful bad treated.’
He shuck his head, and I knowed what he was tinkin' 'bout, but
I neber say one word. Den Miss Bradly wiped her eyes, and
de Doctor fetch anoder sigh, and say, dis is very 'stressin,'
and Miss Bradly say somepin agin ‘slavery,’ and de Doctor
open ob his eyes right wide and say, ‘'tis worth your head, Miss,
for to say dat in dis here country.’ Den she kind of 'splained
it to him, and tings just seemed square 'twixt 'em, for she was
monstrous skeered like, and turned white as a sheet. Den I
hearn de Doctor say sompin' 'bout ridin' on a rail, and tar and
feaders, and abolutionist. So arter dat, Miss Bradly went into
de house, arter she had bin a tellin' ob me to nurse you well;
dat you was way off hare from yer mammy, so eber sence den
you has bin a lying right dar on dat bed, and I hab nursed you
as if you war my own child.”</p>
          <p>I threw my arms around her again, and imprinted kisses upon
her rugged brow; for, though her skin was sooty and her face
worn with care, I believed that somewhere in a silent corner of
her tried heart there was a ray of warm, loving, human feeling.</p>
          <p>“Oh, child,” she begun, “can you wid yer pretty yallow face
kiss an old pitch-black nigger like me?”</p>
          <p>“Why, yes, Aunt Polly, and love you too; if your face is dark
I am sure your heart is fair.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I doesn't know 'bout dat, chile; once 'twas far, but I
tink all de white man done made it black as my face.”</p>
          <pb id="browne56" n="56"/>
          <p>“Oh no, I can't believe that, Aunt Polly,” I replied.</p>
          <p>“Wal, I always hab said dat if dey would cut my finger and
cut a white woman's, dey would find de blood ob de very same
color,” and the old woman laughed exultingly.</p>
          <p>“Yes, but, Aunt Polly, if you were to go before a magistrate
with a case to be decided, he would give it against you, no
matter how just were your claims.”</p>
          <p>“To be sartin, de white folks allers gwine to do every ting in
favor ob dar own color.”</p>
          <p>“But, Aunt Polly,” interposed I, “there is a God above, who
disregards color.”</p>
          <p>“Sure dare is, and dar we will all ob us git our dues, and
den de white folks will roast in de flames ob old Nick.”</p>
          <p>I saw, from a furtive flash of her eye, that all the malignity
and revenge of her outraged nature were becoming excited, and
I endeavored to change the conversation.</p>
          <p>“Is master getting well?”</p>
          <p>“Why, yes, chile, de debbil can't kill him. He is 'termined
to live jist as long as dare is a nigger to torment. All de time
he was crazy wid de fever, he was fightin' wid de niggers—
'pears like he don't dream 'bout nothin' else.”</p>
          <p>“Does he sit up now?” I asked this question with trepidation,
for I really dreaded to see him.</p>
          <p>“No, he can't set up none. De doctor say he lost a power o'
blood, and he won't let him eat meat or anyting strong, and I
tells you, honey, Masser does swar a heap. He wants to
smoke his pipe, and to hab his reglar grog, and dey won't gib it
to him. It do take Jim and Jake bofe to hold him in de bed,
when his tantarums comes on. He fights dem, he calls for de
oberseer, he orders dat ebery nigger on de place shall be tuck
to de post. I tells you now, I makes haste to git out ob his
way. He struck Jake a lick dat kum mighty nigh puttin' out
his eye. It's all bunged up now.”</p>
          <p>“Where did Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic> go?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, de young gemman dat dey say is a courtin' Miss Jane,
he hab gone back to de big town what he kum from; but Lindy
<pb id="browne57" n="57"/>
say Miss Jane got a great long letter from him, and Lindy say
she tink Miss Jane gwine to marry him.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I belong to Miss Jane; I wonder if she will take me
with her to the town.”</p>
          <p>“Why, yes, chile, she will, for she do believe in niggers.
She wants 'em all de time right by her side, a waitin' on her.”</p>
          <p>This thought set me to speculating. Here, then, was the
prospect of another change in my home. The change might
be auspicious; but it would take me away from Aunt Polly,
and remove me from Miss Bradly's influence; and this I
dreaded, for she had planted hopes in my breast, which must
blossom, though at a distant season, and I wished to be often
in her company, so that I might gain many important items
from her.</p>
          <p>Aunt Polly, observing me unusually thoughtful, argued that
I was sleepy, and insisted upon my returning to bed. In
order to avoid further conversation, and preserve, unbroken,
the thread of my reflections, I obeyed her.</p>
          <p>Throwing myself carelessly upon the rough pallet, I
wandered in fancy until leaden-winged sleep overcame me.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>AMY'S NARRATIVE, AND HER PHILOSOPHY OF A FUTURE STATE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>WHEN the golden sun had begun to tinge with light the distant
tree-tops, and the young birds to chant their matin hymn,
I awoke from my profound sleep. Wearily I moved upon my
pillow, for though my slumber had been deep and sweet, yet
now, upon awaking, I experienced no refreshment.</p>
          <p>Rising up in the bed, and supporting myself upon my elbow,
I looked round in quest of Aunt Polly; but then I remembered
that she had to be about the breakfast. Amy was sitting on
the floor, endeavoring to arrange the clothes on a little toddler,
her orphan brother, over whom she exercised a sort of maternal
care. She, her two sisters, and infant brother, were the
orphans of a woman who had once belonged to a brother of
Mr. Peterkin. Their orphanage had not fallen upon them from
the ghastly fingers of death, but from the far more cruel and
cold mandate of human cupidity. A fair, even liberal price
had been offered their owner for their mother, Dilsy, and such
a speculation was not to be resigned upon the score of philanthropy.
No, the man who would refuse nine hundred dollars
for a negro woman, upon the plea that she had three young
children and a helpless infant, from whom she must not be
separated, would, in Kentucky, be pronounced insane; and I can
assure you that, on this subject, the brave Kentuckians had
good right to decide, according to their code, that Elijah
Peterkin was <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">compos mentis</foreign></hi>.</p>
          <p>“Amy,” said I, as I rubbed my eyes, to dissipate the film
and mists of sleep, “is it very late? have you heard the horn
blow for the hands to come in from work?”</p>
          <pb id="browne59" n="59"/>
          <p>“No, me hab not hearn it yet, but laws, Ann, me did tink
you would neber talk no more.”</p>
          <p>“But you see I am talking now,” and I could not resist a
smile; “have you been nursing me?”</p>
          <p>“No, indeed, Aunt Polly wouldn't let me come nigh yer
bed, and she keep all de time washing your body and den
rubbin' it wid a feader an' goose-greese. Oh, you did lay here so
still, jist like somebody dead. Aunt Polly, she wouldn't let one
ob us speak one word, sed it would 'sturb you; but I knowed
you wasn't gwine to kere, so ebery time she went out, I jist
laughed and talked as much as I want.”</p>
          <p>‘But did you not want me to get well, Amy?”</p>
          <p>“Why, sartin I did; but my laughin' want gwine to kill you,
was it?” She looked up with a queer, roguish smile.</p>
          <p>“No, but it might have increased my fever.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you had died, I would hab got yer close, now you
knows you promised 'em to me. So when I hearn Jake say
you was dead, I run and got yer new calico dress, and dat ribbon
what Miss Jane gib you, an' put dem in my box; den arter
while Aunt Polly say you done kum back to life; so I neber
say notin' more, I jist tuck de close and put dem back in yer
box, and tink to myself, well, maybe I will git em some odor
time.”</p>
          <p>It amused me not a little to find that upon mere suspicion of
my demise, this little negro had levied upon my wardrobe, which
was scanty indeed; but so it is, be we ever so humble or
poor, there is always some one to regard us with a covetous
eye. My little paraphernalia was, to this half-savage child, a
rich and wondrous possession.</p>
          <p>“Here, hold up yer foot, Ben, or you shan't hab any meat
fur breakus.” This threat was addressed to her young brother,
whom she nursed like a baby, and whose tiny foot seemed to
resist the restraint of a shoe.</p>
          <p>I looked long at them, and mused with a strange sorrow upon
their probable destiny. Bitter I knew it must be. For, where
is there, beneath the broad sweep of the majestic heavens, a
<pb id="browne60" n="60"/>
single one of the dusky tribe of Ethiopia who has not felt that
existence was to him far more a curse than a blessing? You,
oh, my tawny brothers, who read these tear-stained pages, ask
your own hearts, which, perhaps, now ache almost to bursting,
ask, I say, your own vulture-torn hearts, if life is not a hard,
hard burden? Have you not oftentimes prayed to the All-Merciful
to sever the mystic tie that bound you here, to loosen
your chains and set you, soul and body, free? Have you not,
from the broken chinks of your lonely cabins at night, looked
forth upon the free heavens, and murmured at your fate? Is
there, oh! slave, in your heart a single pleasant memory? Do
you not, captive-husband, recollect with choking pride how the
wife of your bosom has been cruelly lashed while you dared not
say one word in her defence? Have you not seen your children,
precious pledges of undying love, ruthlessly torn from you,
bound hand and foot and sold like dogs in the slave market,
while you dared not offer a single remonstrance? Has not
every social and moral feeling been outraged? Is it not the
white man's policy to degrade your race, thereby finding an 
argument to favor the perpetuation of Slavery? Is there for
us one thing to sweeten bondage? Free African! in the brave
old States of the North, where the shackles of slavery exist
not, to you I call. Noble defenders of Abolition, you whose
earnest eyes may scan these pages, I call to you with a <hi rend="italics">tearful
voice;</hi> I pray you to go on in your glorious cause; flag not,
faint not, prosecute it before heaven and against man. Fling out
your banners and march on to the defence of the suffering ones
at the South. And you, oh my heart-broken sisters, toiling beneath
a tropic sun, wearing out your lives in the service of
tyrants, to you I say, hope and pray still! Trust in God!
He is mighty and willing to save, and, in an hour that you
know not of, he will roll the stone away from the portal of
your hearts. My prayers are with you and for you. I have
come up from the same tribulation, and I vow, by the scars and
wounds upon my flesh, never to forget your cause. Would that
<pb id="browne61" n="61"/>
my tears, which freely flow for you, had power to dissolve the
fetters of your wasting bondage.</p>
          <p>Thoughts like these, though with more vagueness and less
form, passed through my brain as I looked upon those poor
little outcast children, and I must be excused for thus making,
regardless of the usual etiquette of authors, an appeal to the
hearts of my free friends. Never once do I wish them to lose
sight of the noble cause to which they have lent the influence
of their names. I am but a poor, unlearned woman, whose
heart is in her cause, and I should be untrue to the motive
which induced me to chronicle the dark passages in my woe-worn
life if I did not urge and importune the Apostles of Abolition
to move forward and onward in their march of reform.</p>
          <p>“Come, Amy, near to my bed, and talk a little with me.”</p>
          <p>“I wants to git some bread fust.”</p>
          <p>“You are always hungry,” I pettishly replied.</p>
          <p>“No, I isn't, but den, Ann, I neber does git enuf to eat here.
Now, we use to hab more at Mas' Lijah's.”</p>
          <p>“Was he a good master?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“No, he wasn't; but den mammy used to gib us nice tings
to eat. She buyed it from de store, and she let us hab plenty
ob it.”</p>
          <p>“Where is your mammy?”</p>
          <p>“She bin sold down de ribber to a trader,” and there was a
quiver in the child's voice.</p>
          <p>“Did she want to go?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>“No, she cried a heap, and tell Masser she wouldn't mind it
if he would let her take us chilen; but Masser say no, he
wouldn't. Den she axed him please to let her hab  little Ben,
anyhow. Masser cussed, and said, Well, she might hab Ben,
as he was too little to be ob any sarvice; den she 'peared so
glad and got him all ready to take; but when de trader kum to
take her away, he say he wouldn't 'low her to take Ben, kase
he couldn't sell her fur as much, if she hab a baby wid her;
den, oh den, how poor mammy did cry and beg; but de trader
tuck his cowhide and whipped her so hard she hab to stop cryin'
<pb id="browne62" n="62"/>
or beggin'. Den she kum to me and make me promise to take
good care ob Ben, to nurse him and tend on him as long as I
staid whar he was. Den she knelt down in de corner of her
cabin and prayed to God to take care ob us, all de days of our
life; den she kissed us all and squeezed us tight, and when she
tuck little Ben in her arms it 'peared like her heart would 
break. De water from her eyes wet Ben's apron right ringing
wet, jist like it had come out ob a washing tub. Den de trader
called to her to come along, and den she gib dis to me, and told
me dat ebery time I looked at it, I must tink of my poor mammy 
dat was sold down de ribber, and 'member my promise to
her 'bout my little brudder.”</p>
          <p>Here the child exhibited a bored five-cent piece, which she
wore suspended by a black string around her neck.</p>
          <p>“De chilen has tried many times to git it away frum me; but
I's allers beat 'em off; and whenever Miss Tildy wants me fur
to mind her, she says, ‘Now, Amy, I'll jist take yer mammy's
present from yer if yer doesn't do what I bids yer;’ den de way
dis here chile does work isn't slow, I ken tell yer,” and with
her characteristic gesture she run her tongue out at the corner
of her mouth in an oblique manner, and suddenly withdrew it,
as though it had passed over a scathing iron.</p>
          <p>“Could anything induce you to part with it?” I asked.</p>
          <p>She rolled her eyes up with a look of wonderment, and
replied, half ferociously, “Gracious! No—why, hasn't I bin
whipped, 'bused and treed; still I'd hold fast to this. No mortal
ken take it frum me. You may kill me in welcome,” and
the child shook her head with a philosophical air, as she said,
“and I don't kere much, so mammy's chilen dies along wid me,
fur I didn't see no use in our livin' eny how. I's done got my
full shere ob beatin' an' we hain't no use on dis here airth—so I
jist wants fur to die.”</p>
          <p>I looked upon her, so uncared for, so forlorn in her condition,
and I could not find it in my heart to blame her for the wish,
erring and rebellions as it must appear to the Christian. What
<hi rend="italics">had</hi> she to live for? To those little children, the sacred bequests
<pb id="browne63" n="63"/>
of her mother, she was no protection; for, even had she been
capable of extending to them all the guidance and watchfulness,
both of soul and body, which their delicate and immature natures
required, there was every probability, nay, there was a
certainty, that this duty would be denied her. She could not
hope, at best, to live with them more than a few years. They
were but cattle, chattels, property, subject to the will and pleasure
of their owners. There would speedily come a time when
a division must take place in the estate, and that division would
necessarily cause a separation and rupture of family ties. What
wonder then, that this poor ignorant child sighed for the calm,
unfearing, unbroken rest of the grave? She dreamed not of a
“more beyond;” she thought her soul mortal, even as her body;
and had she been told that there was for her a world, even a
blessed one, to succeed death, she would have shuddered and
feared to cross the threshold of the grave. She thought annihilation
the greatest, the only blessing awaiting her. The
idea of another life would have brought with it visions of a
new master and protracted slavery. Freedom and equality of
souls, irrespective of <hi rend="italics">color</hi>, was too transcendental and chimerical
an idea to take root in her practical brain. Many times had
she heard her master declare that “niggers were jist like dogs,
laid down and died, and nothin' come of them afterwards.”
His philosophy could have proposed nothing more delightful to
her ease-coveting mind.</p>
          <p>Some weeks afterwards, when I was trying to teach her the
doctrine of the immortality of the soul, she broke forth in an
idiotic laugh, as she said, “oh, no, dat gold city what dey sings
'bout in hymns, will do fur do white folks; but nothin' eber
comes of niggers; dey jist dies and rots.”</p>
          <p>“Who do you think made negroes?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>Looking up with a meaning grin, she said, “White folks
made 'em fur der own use, I 'spect.”</p>
          <p>“Why do you think that?”</p>
          <p>“Kase white folks ken kill 'em when dey pleases; so I 'spose
dey make 'em.”</p>
          <pb id="browne64" n="64"/>
          <p>This was a species of reasoning which, for a moment,
confounded my logic. Seeing that I lacked a ready reply, she
went on:</p>
          <p>“Yes, you see, Ann, we hab no use wid a soul. De white
folks won't hab any work to hab done up dere, and so dey
won't hab no use fur niggers.”</p>
          <p>“Doesn't this make you miserable?”</p>
          <p>“What?” she asked, with amazement.</p>
          <p>“This thought of dying, and rotting like the vilest worm.”</p>
          <p>“No, indeed, it makes me glad; fur den I'll not hab anybody
to beat me; knock, kick, and cuff me 'bout, like dey does now.”</p>
          <p>“Poor child, happier far,” I thought, “in your ignorance,
than I, with all the weight of fearful responsibility that my
little knowledge entails upon me. On you, God will look with
a more pitying eye than upon me, to whom he has delegated
the stewardship of two talents.”</p>

          <argument>
            <p>TALK AT THE FARM-HOUSE—THREATS—THE NEW BEAU—LINDY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>SEVERAL days had elapsed since the morning conversation
with Amy; meanwhile matters were jogging along in their
usually dull way. Of late, since the flight of Mr. Jones, and
the illness of Mr. Peterkin, there had been considerably less
fighting; but the ladies made innumerable threats of what they
would do, when their father should be well enough to allow a
suspension of nursing duties.</p>
          <p>My wounds had rapidly healed, and I had resumed my former
position in the discharge of household duties. Lindy, my old
assistant, still held her place. I always had an aversion to her.
There was that about her entire physique which made her
odious to me. A certain laxity of the muscles and joints of
her frame, which produced a floundering, shuffling sort of gait
that was peculiarly disagreeable, a narrow, soulless countenance,
an oblique leer of the eye where an ambushed fiend seemed to
lurk, full, voluptuous lips, lengthy chin, and expanded nostril,
combined to prove her very low in the scale of animals. She
had a kind of dare-devil courage, which seemed to brave a great
deal, and yet she shrank from everything like punishment.
There was a union of degrading passions in her character. I
doubt if the lowest realm of Hades contained a baser spirit.
This girl, I felt assured from the first time I beheld her, was
destined to be my evil genius. I felt that the baleful cornet
that presided over her birth, would in his reckless and maddening
course, rush too near the little star which, through cloud
and shadow, beamed on my destiny.</p>
          <p>She was not without a certain kind of sprightliness that passed
for intelligence; and she could by her adroitness of manœuvre
<pb id="browne66" n="66"/>
amble out of any difficulty. With a good education she would
have made an excellent female pettifogger. She had all of the
quickness and diablerie usually summed up in that most
expressive American word, “<hi rend="italics">smartness</hi>.”</p>
          <p>I was a good deal vexed and grieved to find myself again a
partner of hers in the discharge of my duties. It seemed to
open my wounds afresh; for I remembered that her falsehood
had gained me the severe castigation that had almost deprived
me of life; and her laugh and jibe had rendered my suffering
at the accursed post even more humiliating. Yet I knew better
than to offer a demurrer to any arrangement that my mistress
had made.</p>
          <p>One day as I was preparing to set the table for the noon
meal, Lindy came to me and whispered, in an under-tone, “You
finish the table, I am going out; and if Miss Jane or Tildy axes
where I is, say dat I went to de kitchen to wash a dish.”</p>
          <p>“Very well,” I replied in my usual laconic style, and went
on about my work. It was well for her that she had observed
this precaution; for in a few moments Miss Tildy came in, and
her first question was for Lindy. I answered as I had been
desired to do. The reply appeared to satisfy her, and with the
injunction (one she never failed to give), that I should do my
work well and briskly, she left the room.</p>
          <p>After I had arranged the table to my satisfaction, I went to
the kitchen to assist Aunt Polly in dishing up dinner.
When I reached the kitchen I found Aunt Polly in a great
quandary. The fire was not brisk enough to brown her bread,
and she dared not send it to the table without its being as
beautifully brown as a student's meditations.</p>
          <p>“Oh, child,” she began, “do run somewhar' and git me a
scrap or so of dry wood, so as to raise a smart little blaze to
brown dis bread.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed I will,” and off I bounded in quest of the combustible
material. Of late Aunt Polly and I had become as
devoted as mother and child. 'Tis true there was a deep yearning
in my heart, a thirst for intercommunion of soul, which this
<pb id="browne67" n="67"/>
untutored negress could not supply. She did not answer,
with a thrilling response, to the deep cry which my spirit sent
out; yet she was kind, and even affectionate, to me. Usually
harsh to others, with me she was gentle as a lamb. With a
thousand little motherly acts she won my heart, and I strove,
by assiduous kindness, to make her forget that I was not her
daughter. I started off with great alacrity in search of the dry
wood, and remembered that on the day previous I had seen
some barrel staves lying near an out-house, and these I knew
would quickly ignite. When rapidly turning the corner of
the stable, I was surprised to see Lindy standing in close and
apparently free conversation with a strange-looking white man.
The sound of my rapid footsteps startled them; and upon
seeing me, the man walked off hastily. With a fluttering,
excited manner, Lindy came up and said:</p>
          <p>“Don't say nothing 'bout haven' seed me wid dat ar' gemman;
fur he used to be my mars'er, and a good one he was
too.”</p>
          <p>I promised that I would say nothing about the matter, but
first I inquired what was the nature of the private interview.</p>
          <p>“Oh, he jist wanted fur to see me, and know how I was
gitten' long.</p>
          <p>I said no more; but I was not satisfied with her explanation.
I resolved to watch her narrowly, and ferret out, if possible, this
seeming mystery. Upon my return to the kitchen, with my
bundle of dry sticks, I related what I had seen to Aunt Polly.</p>
          <p>“Dat gal is arter sompen not very good, you mark my words
fur it.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, maybe not, Aunt Polly,” I answered, though with a
conviction that I was speaking at variance with the strong
probabilities of the case.</p>
          <p>I hurried in the viands and meats for the table, and was not
surprised to find Lindy unusually obliging, for I understood the
object. There was an abashed air and manner which argued
guilt, or at least, that she was the mistress of a secret, for the
entire possession of which she trembled. Sundry little acts of
<pb id="browne68" n="68"/>
unaccustomed kindness she offered me, but I quietly declined
them. I did not desire that she should insult my honor by the
offer of a tacit bribe.</p>
          <p>In the evening, when I was arranging Miss Jane's hair (this
was my especial duty), she surprised me by asking, in a
careless and incautious manner:</p>
          <p>“Ann, what is the matter with Lindy? she has such an
excited manner.”</p>
          <p>“I really don't know, Miss Jane; I have not observed
anything very unusual in her.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I have, and I shall speak to her about it. Oh, there!
slow, girl, slow; you pulled my hair. Don't do it again. You
niggers have become so unruly since pa's sickness, that if we
don't soon get another overseer, there will be no living for you.
There is Lindy in the sulks, simply because she wants a
whipping, and old Polly hasn't given us a meal fit to eat.”</p>
          <p>“Have I done anything, Miss Jane?” I asked with a
misgiving.</p>
          <p>“No, nothing in particular, except showing a general and
continued sullenness. Now, I do despise to see a nigger always
sour-looking; and I can tell you, Ann, you must change your
ways, or it will be worse for you.”</p>
          <p>“I try to be cheerful, Miss Jane, but—”here I wisely checked
myself.<corr sic="&quot;"/></p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Try to be</hi>,” she echoed with a satirical tone. “What do
you mean by <hi rend="italics">trying</hi>? You don't dare to say you are not happy
<hi rend="ITALICS">here</hi>?”</p>
          <p>Finding that I made no reply, she said, “If you don't cut
your cards squarely, you will find yourself down the river
before long, and there you are only half-clad and half-fed, and
flogged every day.” Still I made no reply. I knew that if I
spoke truthfully, and as my heart prompted, it would only
redound to my misery. What right had I to speak of my
mother. She was no more than an animal, and as destitute of
the refinement of common human feeling—so I forbore to allude
to her, or my great desire to see her. I dared not speak of the
<pb id="browne69" n="69"/>
horrible manner in which my body had been cut and slashed,
the half-lifeless condition in which I had been taken from the
accursed post, and all for a fault which was not mine. These
were things which, as they were done by my master's commands,
were nothing more than right; so with an effort, I controlled
my emotion, and checked the big tears which I felt
were rushing up to my eyes.</p>
          <p>When I had put the finishing stroke to Miss Jane's hair, and
whilst she was surveying herself in a large French mirror,
Miss Bradly came in. Tossing her bonnet off, she kissed Miss
Jane very affectionately, nodded to me, and asked,</p>
          <p>“Where is Tildy?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, somewhere about the house, I suppose,”
replied Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“Well, I have a new beau for her; now it will be a fine
chance for Tildy. I would have recommended you; but,
knowing of your previous engagement, I thought it best to refer
him to the fair Matilda.”</p>
          <p>Miss Jane laughed, and answered, that “though she was engaged,
she would have no objections to trying her charms upon
another beau.”</p>
          <p>There was a strange expression upon Miss Bradly's face, and
a flurried, excited manner, very different from her usually quiet
demeanor.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane went about the room collecting, here and there, a
stray pocket handkerchief, under-sleeve, or chemisette; and,
dashing them toward me, she said,</p>
          <p>“Put these in wash, and do, pray, Ann, try to look more
cheerful. Now, Miss Emily,” she added, addressing Miss Bradly,
we have the worst servants in the world. There is Lindy, I
believe the d—l is in her. She is so strange in her actions. I
have to repeat a thing three or four times before she will
understand me; and, as for Ann, she looks so sullen that it gives
one the horrors to see her. I've a notion to bring Amy into
the house. In the kitchen she is of no earthly service, and
doesn't earn her salt. I think I'll persuade pa to sell some of
<pb id="browne70" n="70"/>
these worthless niggers. They are no profit, and a terrible
expense.” Thereupon she was interrupted by the entrance of
Miss Tildy, whose face was unusually excited. She did not
perceive Miss Bradly, and so broke forth in a torrent of invectives
against “niggers.”</p>
          <p>“I hate them. I wish this place were rid of every black
face. Now we can't find that wretched Lindy anywhere, high
nor low. Let me once get hold of her, and I'll be bound she
shall remember it to the day of her death. Oh! Miss Bradly,
is that you? pray excuse me for not recognizing you sooner;
but since pa's sickness, these wretched negroes have half-taken
the place, and I shouldn't be surprised if I were to forget myself,”
and with a kiss she seemed to think she had atoned to
Miss Bradly for her forgetfulness.</p>
          <p>To all of this Miss B. made no reply, I fancied (perhaps it
was only fancy) that there was a shade of discontent upon her
face; but she still preserved her silence, and Miss Tildy waxed
warmer and warmer in her denunciation of ungrateful
“niggers.”</p>
          <p>“Now, here, ours have every wish gratified; are treated well,
fed well, clothed well, and yet we can't get work enough out
of them to justify us in retaining our present number. As soon
as pa gets well I intend to urge upon him the necessity of selling
some of them. It is really too outrageous for us to be keeping
such a number of the worthless wretches; actually eating
us out of house and home. Besides, our family expenses are
rapidly increasing. Brother must be sent off to college. It
will not do to have his education neglected. I really am becoming
quite ashamed of his want of preparation for a profession.
I wish him sent to Yale, after first receiving a preparatory
course in some less noted seminary,—then he will require
a handsome outfit of books, and a wardrobe inferior to none at
the institution; for, Miss Emily, I am determined our family
shall have a position in every circle.” As Miss Tildy pronounced
these words, she stamped her foot in the most emphatic way, as
if to confirm and ratify her determination.</p>
          <pb id="browne71" n="71"/>
          <p>“Yes,” said Miss Jane, “I was just telling Miss Emily of
our plans; and I think we may as well bring Amy in the
house. She is of no account in the kitchen, and Lindy, Ginsy,
and those brats, can be sold for a very pretty sum if taken to
the city of L—, and put upon the block, or disposed of to
some wealthy trader.”</p>
          <p>“What children?” asked Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>“Why, Amy's two sisters and brother, and Ginsy's child,
and Ginsy too, if pa will let her go.”</p>
          <p>My heart ached well-nigh to bursting, when I heard this.
Poor, poor Amy, child-sufferer! another drop of gall added to
thy draught of wormwood—another thorn added to thy
wearing crown. Oh, God how I shuddered for the victim.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane went on in her usual heartless tone. “It is expensive
to keep them; they are no account, no profit to us and
young niggers are my 'special aversion. I have, for a long
time, intended separating Amy from her two little sisters; she
doesn't do anything but nurse that sickly child, Ben, and it is
scandalous. You see, Miss Emily, we want an arbor erected
in the yard, and a conservatory, and some new-style table
furniture.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, and I want a set of jewels, and a good many additions
to my wardrobe, and Jane wishes to spend a winter in
the city. She will be forced to have a suitable outfit.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, and I am going to have everything I want, if the
farm is to be sold,” said Miss Jane, in a voice that no one
dared to gainsay.</p>
          <p>“But come, let me tell you, Tildy, about the new beau I
have for you,” said Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>Instantly Miss Tildy's eyes began to glisten. The word
“beau ” was the ready “sesame” to her good humor.</p>
          <p>“Oh, now, dear, good Miss Emily, tell me something about
him. Who is he? where from?” &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly smiled, coaxingly and lovingly, as she answered:</p>
          <p>“Well, Tildy, darling, I have a friend from the North, who
is travelling for pleasure through the valley of the Mississippi;
<pb id="browne72" n="72"/>
and I promised to introduce him to some of the pretty ladies of
the West; so, of course, I feel pride in introducing my two
pupils to him.”</p>
          <p>This was a most agreeable sedative to their ill-nature; and
both sisters came close to Miss Bradly, fairly covering her with
caresses, and addressing to her words of flattery.</p>
          <p>As soon as my services were dispensed with I repaired to
the kitchen, where I found Aunt Polly in no very good or
amiable mood. Something had gone wrong about the arrangements
for supper. The chicken was not brown enough, or the
cakes were heavy; something troubled her, and as a necessary
consequence her temper was suffering.</p>
          <p>“I's in an orful humor, Ann, so jist don't come nigh me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, but, Aunt Polly, we should learn to control these
humors. They are not the dictates of a pure spirit; they are
unchristian.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, laws, chile, what hab us to do wid der Christians?
We are like dem poor headens what de preachers prays 'bout.
We aint got no 'sponsibility, no more den de dogs.”</p>
          <p>“I don't think that way, Aunt Polly; I think I am as much
bound to do my duty, and expect a reward at the hands of my
Maker, as any white person.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, 'taint no use of talkin' dat ar' way, kase ebery body
knows niggers ain't gwine to de same place whar dar massers
goes.”</p>
          <p>I dared not confront her obstinacy with any argument; for
I knew she was unwilling to believe. Poor, apathetic creature!
she was happier in yielding up her soul to the keeping of her
owner, than she would have been in guiding it herself. This
to me would have been enslavement indeed; such as I could
not have endured. He, my Creator, who gave me this heritage
of thought, and the bounty of Hope, gave me, likewise, a strong,
unbridled will, which nothing can conquer. The whip may
bring my body into subjection, but the free, free spirit soars
where it lists, and no man can check it. God is with the soul!
aye, in it, animating and encouraging it, sustaining it amid the
<pb id="browne73" n="73"/>
crash, conflict, and the elemental war of passion The poor,
weak flesh may yield; but, thanks to God! the soul, well-girded
and heaven-poised, will never shrink.</p>
          <p>Many and long have been the unslumbering nights when I
have lain upon my heap of straw, gazing at the pallid moon,
and the sorrowful stars; weaving mystic fancies as the wailing
night-wind seemed to bring me a message from the distant and
the lost! I have felt whole vials of heavenly unction poured
upon my bruised soul; rich gifts have descended, like the manna
of old, upon my famishing spirit; and I have felt that God was
nearer to me in the night time. I have imagined that the very
atmosphere grew luminous with the presence of angelic hosts;
and a strange music, audible alone to my ears, has lulled me
to the gentlest of dreams! God be thanked for the night, the
stars, and the spirit's vision! Joy came not to me with the
breaking of the morn; but peace, undefined, enwrapped me
when the mantle of darkness and the crown of stars attested
the reign of Night!</p>
          <p>I grieved to think that my poor friend, this old, lonely negress,
had nothing to soothe and charm her wearied heart. There
was not a single flower blooming up amid the rank weeds of
her nature. Hard and rocky it seemed; yet had I found the
prophet's wand, whereby to strike the flinty heart, and draw
forth living waters! pure, genial draughts of kindliness, sweet
honey drops, hived away in the lonely cells of her caverned
soul! I would have loved to give her a portion of that peace
which radiated with its divine light the depths of my inmost
spirit. I had come to her now for the purpose of giving her
the sad intelligence that awaited poor Amy; but I did not
find her in a suitable mood. I felt assured that her harshness
would, in some way or other, jar the finer and more sensitive
harmonies of my nature. Perhaps she would say that she did
not care for the sufferings of the poor, lonely child; and that
her bereavement would be nothing more than just; yet I knew
that she did not feel thus. Deep in her secret soul there lay
folded a white-winged angel, even as the uncomely bulb
<pb id="browne74" n="74"/>
envelopes the fair petals of the lily; and I longed for the summer
warmth of kindness to bid it come forth and bloom in beauty.</p>
          <p>But now I turned away from her, murmuring, “ 'Tis not the
time.” She would not open her heart, and my own must like-wise
be closed and silent; but when I met poor little Amy,
looking so neglected, with scarcely apparel sufficient to cover
her nudity, my heart failed me utterly. There she held upon
her hip little Ben, her only joy; every now and then she
addressed some admonitory words to him, such as “Hush, baby,
love,” “you's my baby,” “sissy loves it,” and similar expressions of coaxing and endearment. And this, her only comfort, was
about to be wrenched from her. The only link of love that
bound her to a weary existence, was to be severed by the harsh
mandate of another. Just God! is this right? Oh, my soul.
be thou still! Look on in patience! The cloud deepens above!
The day of God's wrath is at hand! They who have coldly
forbidden our indulging the sweet humanities of life, who have
destroyed every social relation, severed kith and kin, ruptured
the ties of blood, and left us more lonely than the beasts of the
forest, may tremble when the avenger comes!</p>
          <p>I ventured to speak with Amy, and I employed the kindest
tone; but ever and anon little Ben would send forth such a
piteous wail, that I feared he was in physical pain. Amy,
however, very earnestly assured me that she had administered
catnip tea in plentiful quantities, and had examined his person
very carefully to discover if a pin or needle had punctured his
flesh; but everything seemed perfectly right.</p>
          <p>I attempted to take him in my arms; but he clung so vigorously
to Amy's shoulder, that it required strength to unfasten
his grasp.</p>
          <p>“Oh, don'tee take him; he doesn't like fur to leab me.
Him usen to me,” cried Amy, as in a motherly way she
caressed him. “Now, pretty little boy donee cry any more.
Ann shan't hab you;—now be a good nice boy;” and thus she
expended upon him her whole vocabulary of endearing epithets.</p>
          <p>“Who could,” I asked myself, “have the heart to untie this
<pb id="browne75" n="75"/>
sweet fraternal bond? Who could dry up the only fountain in
this benighted soul? Oh, I have often marvelled how the white
mother, who knows, in such perfection, the binding beauty of
maternal love, can look unsympathizingly on, and see the poor
black parent torn away from her children. I once saw a white
lady, of conceded <hi rend="italics">refinement</hi>, sitting in the portico of her own house,
with her youngest born, a babe of some seven months, dallying
on her knee, and she toying with the pretty gold-threads of
its silken hair, whilst her husband was in the kitchen, with a
whip in his hand, severely lashing a negro woman, whom he
had sold to a trader—lashing her because she refused to go
<hi rend="italics">cheerfully</hi> and leave her infant behind. The poor wretch, as a
last resource, fled to her Mistress, and, on her knees, begged her
to have her child. “Oh, Mistress,” cried the frantic black woman,
“ask Master to let me take my baby with me.” What think
you was the answer of this white mother?</p>
          <p>“Go away, you impudent wretch, you don't deserve to have
your child. It will be better off away from you!” Aye,
this was the answer which, accompanied by a derisive sneer,
she gave to the heart-stricken black mother. Thus she felt,
spoke, and acted, even whilst caressing her own helpless infant!
Who would think it injustice to “commend the poison-chalice
to her own lips”? She, this fine lady, was known to weep
violently, because an Irish woman was unable to save a suffiency
of money from her earnings to bring her son from Ireland
to America; but, for the African mother, who was parting
eternally from her helpless babe, she had not so much as a
consolatory word. Oh, ye of the proud Caucasian race, would
that your hearts were as fair and spotless as your complexions!
Truly can the Saviour say of you, “Oh, Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
I would have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her
chickens, but ye would not!” Oh, perverse generation of vipers,
how long will you abuse the Divine forbearance!</p>

          <p>“Where,” she asked me, “are the young ladies? have they
company?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I replied, “Miss Bradly is with them, and they are
expecting a young gentleman, an acquaintance of Miss B.'s.”</p>
          <p>“Who is he?”</p>
          <p>“Why, Lindy, how should I know?”</p>
          <p>“I thought maybe you hearn his name.”</p>
          <p>“No, I did not, and, even if I had, it would have been so
unimportant to me that I should have forgotten it.”</p>
          <p>She opened her eyes with a vacant stare, but it was
perceptible that she wandered in thought.</p>
          <p>“Now, Lindy,” I began, “Miss Jane has missed you from the
house, and both she and Miss Tildy have sworn vengeance
against you.”</p>
          <p>“So have I sworn it agin' them.”</p>
          <p>“What! what did you say, Lindy?”</p>
          <p>Really I was surprised at the girl's hardihood and boldness.
She had been thrown from her guard, and now, upon regaining
her composure, was alarmed.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I was only joking, Ann; you knows we allers jokes.”</p>
          <p>“I never do,” I said, with emphasis.</p>
          <pb id="browne77" n="77"/>
          <p>‘Yes, but den, Ann, you see you is one ob de quare uns.”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean by quare?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, psha, 'taint no use ob talkin wid you, for you is good;
but kum, tell me, is dey mad wid me in de house, and did dey
say dey would beat me?”</p>
          <p>“Well, they threatened something of the kind.”</p>
          <p>Her face grew ashen pale; it took that peculiar kind of pallor
which the negro's face often assumes under the influence of
fear or disease, and which is so disagreeable to look upon.
Enemy of mine as she had deeply proven herself to be, I could
not be guilty of the meanness of exulting in her trouble.</p>
          <p>“But,” she said, in an imploring tone, “you will not repeat
what I jist said in fun.”</p>
          <p>“Of course I will not; but don't you remember that it was
your falsehood that gained for me the only post-whipping
that I ever had?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; but den I is berry sorry fur dat, and will not do it
any more.”</p>
          <p>This was enough for me. An acknowledgment of contrition,
and a determination to do better, are all God requires of the
offender; and shall poor, erring mortals demand more? No;
my resentment was fully satisfied. Besides, I felt that this
poor creature was not altogether blamable. None of her better
feelings had been cultivated; they were strangled in their
incipiency, whilst her savage instincts were left to run riot.
Thus the bad had ripened into a full and noxious development,
whilst the noble had been crushed in the bud. Who is to be
answerable for the short-comings of such a soul? Surely he
who has cut it off from all moral and mental culture, and has
said to the glimmerings of its faint intellect, “Back, back to the
depths of darkness!” Surely he will and must take upon himself
the burden of accountability. The sin is at his door, and
woe-worth the day, when the great Judge shall come to pass
sentence upon him. I have often thought that the master of slaves
must, for consistency's sake, be an infidel—or doubt man's
exact accountability to God for the deeds done in the body;
<pb id="browne78" n="78"/>
for how can he willingly assume the sins of some hundreds
of souls? In the eye of human law, the slave has no responsibility;
the master assumes all for him. If the slave is found
guilty of a capital offence, punishable with death, the master is
indemnified by a paid valuation, for yielding up the person of
the slave to the demands of offended justice? If a slave earns
money by his labors at night or holidays, or if he is the successful
holder of a prize ticket in a lottery, his master can legally
claim the money, and there is no power to gainsay him?
If, then, human law recognizes a negro as irresponsible, how
much more lenient and just will be the divine statute? Thus,
I hold (and I cannot think there is just logician, theologian, or
metaphysician, who will dissent), that the owner of slaves becomes
sponsor to God for the sins of his slave; and I cannot,
then, think that one who accredits the existence of a just God,
a Supreme Ruler, to whom we are all responsible for our deeds
and words, would willingly take upon himself the burden of
other people's faults and transgressions.</p>
          <p>Whilst I stood talking with Lindy, the sound of merry
laughter reached our ears.</p>
          <p>“Oh, dat is Miss Tildy, now is my time to go in, and see
what dey will say to me; maybe while dey is in a good humor,
dey will not beat me.”</p>
          <p>And, thus saying, Lindy hurried away. Sad thoughts were
crowding in my mind. Dark misgivings were stirring in my
brain. Again I thought of the blessed society, with its humanitarian
hope and aim, that dwelt afar off in the north. I
longed to ask Miss Bradly more about it. I longed to hear of
those holy men, blessed prophets foretelling a millennial era for
my poor, down-trodden and despised race. I longed to ask
questions of her; but of late she had shunned me; she scarcely
spoke to me; and when she did speak, it was with indifference,
and a degree of coldness that she had never before assumed.</p>
          <p>With these thoughts in my mind I stole along through the
yard, until I stood almost directly under the window of the
parlor. Something in the tone of a strange voice that reached
<pb id="browne79" n="79"/>
my ear, riveted my attention. It was a low, manly tone, lute-like,
yet swelling on the breeze, and charming the soul! It
refreshed my senses like a draught of cooling water. I caught
the tone, and could not move from the spot. I was transfixed.</p>
          <p>“I do not see why Fred Douglas is not equal to the best
man in the land. What constitutes worth of character? What
makes the man? What gives elevation to him?” These were
the words I first distinctly heard, spoken in a deep, earnest tone,
which I have never forgotten. I then heard a silly laugh, which
I readily recognized as Miss Jane's, as she answered, “You
can't pretend to say that you would be willing for a sister of
yours to marry Fred Douglas, accomplished as you consider
him?”</p>
          <p>“I did not speak of marrying at all; and might I not be an
advocate of universal liberty, without believing in amalgamation?
Yet, it is a question whether even amalgamation should be forbidden
by law. The negro is a different race; but I do not
know that they have other than human feelings and emotions.
The negroes are, with us, the direct descendants from the great
progenitor of the human family, old Adam. They may, when
fitted by education, even transcend us in the refinements and
graces which adorn civilized character. In loftiness of purpose,
in mental culture, in genius, in urbanity, in the exercise of
manly virtues, such as fortitude, courage, and philanthropy, where
will you show me a man that excels Fred Douglas? And must
the mere fact of his tawny complexion exclude him from the pale
of that society which he is so eminently fitted to grace? Might
I not (if it were made a question) prefer uniting my sister's fate
with such a man, even though partially black, to seeing her
tied to a low fellow, a wine-bibber, a swearer, a villain,
who possessed not one cubit of the stature of true manhood, yet
had a complexion white as snow? Ah, Miss, it is not the skin
which gives us true value as men and women; 'tis the momentum
of mind and the purity of morals, the integrity of purpose
and nobility of soul, that make our place in the scale of
being. I care not if the skin be black as Erebus or fair and
<pb id="browne80" n="80"/>
smooth as satin, so the heart and mind be right. I do not deal
in externals or care for surfaces.”</p>
          <p>These words were as the bread of life to me. I could
scarcely resist the temptation to leave my hiding-place and look
in at the open window, to get sight of the speaker; surely, I
thought, he must wear the robes of a prophet. I could not
very distinctly hear what Miss Jane said in reply. I could catch
many words, such as “nigger” and “marry” “white lady,” and
other expressions used in an expostulatory voice; but the platitudes
which she employed would not have answered the demand
of my higher reason. Old perversions and misinterpretations of
portions of the Bible, such as the story of Hagar, and the curse
pronounced upon Ham, were adduced by Miss Jane and Miss
Tildy in a tone of triumph.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I sicken over these stories,” said the same winning
voice. “How long will Christians willingly resist the known
truth? How long will they bay at heaven with their cruel
blasphemies? For I hold it to be blasphemy when a body of
Christians, professing to be followers of Him who came from
heaven to earth, and assumed the substance of humanity to
teach us a lesson, argue thus. Our Great Model declares that
‘He came not to be ministered unto but to minister.’ He inculcated
practically the lesson of humility in the washing of the
disciples' feet; yet, these His modern disciples, the followers
of to-day, preach, even from the sacred desk, the right of men to
hold their fellow-creatures in bondage through endless generations,
to sell them for gold, to beat them, to keep them in a heathenish
ignorance; and yet declare that it all has the divine sanction.
Verily, oh night of Judaism, thou wast brighter than this our
noon-day of Christianity! Black and bitter is the account, oh
Church of God, that thou art gathering to thyself! I could pray
for a tongue of inspiration, wherewith to denounce this foul
crime. I could pray for the power to show to my country the
terrible stain she has painted upon the banner of freedom.
How dare we, as Americans, boast of this as the home and
temple of liberty? Where are the ‘inalienable rights’ of
<pb id="browne81" n="81"/>
which our Constitution talks in such trumpet-tones? Does
not our Declaration of Independence aver, that all men are
born free and equal? Now, do we not make this a practical
falsehood? Let the poor slave come up to the tribunal of
justice, and ask the wise judge upon the bench to interpret
this piece of plain English to him! How would the man of
ermine blush at his own quibbles?”</p>
          <p>I could tell from the speaker's voice that he had risen from
his seat, and I knew, from the sound of footsteps, that he was
approaching the window. I crouched down lower and lower,
in order to conceal myself from observation, but gazed up to
behold one whose noble sentiments and bold expression of them
had so entranced me.</p>
          <p>Very noble looked he, standing there, with the silver moonlight
beaming upon his broad, white brow, and his deep, blue
eye uplifted to the star-written skies. His features were calm
and classic in their mould, and a mystic light seemed to idealize
and spiritualize his face and form. Kneeling down upon the
earth, I looked reverently to him, as the children of old looked
upon their prophets. He did not perceive me, and even
if he had, what should I have been to him—a pale-browed
student, whose thought, large and expansive, was filled with the
noble, the philanthropic, and the great. Yet, there I crouched
in fear and trembling, lest a breath should betray my secret
place. But, would not his extended pity have embraced me,
even me, a poor, insignificant, uncared-for thing in the great world
—one who bore upon her face the impress of the listed nation?
Ay, I felt that he would not have condemned me as one devoid
of the noble impulse of a heroic humanity. If the African
has not heroism, pray where will you find it? Are there, in
the high endurance of the heroes of old Sparta, sufferings such
as the unchronicled life of many a slave can furnish forth?
Martyrs have gone to the stake; but amid the pomp and sounding
psaltery of a choir, and above the flame, the fagot and the
scaffold, they descried the immortal crown, and even the
worldly and sensuous desire of canonization may not have been
<pb id="browne82" n="82"/>
dead with them. The patriot braves the battle, and dies amid
the thickest of the carnage, whilst the jubilant strains of
music herald him away. The soldier perishes amid the proud
acclaim of his countrymen; but the poor negro dies a martyr,
unknown, unsung, and uncheered. Many expire at the whipping-post,
with the gleesome shouts of their inhuman tormentors,
as their only cheering. Yet few pity us. We are valuable
only as property. Our lives are nothing, and our souls—why
they scarcely think we have any. In reflecting upon these
things, in looking calmly back over my past life, and in reviewing
the lives of many who are familiar to me, I have felt that
the Lord's forbearance must indeed be great; and when thoughts
of revenge have curdled my blood, the prayer of my suffering
Saviour: “Father forgive them, for they know not what they
do,” has flashed through my mind, and I have repelled them
as angry and unchristian. Jesus drank the wormwood and the
gall; and we, oh, brethren and sisters of the banned race,
must “tread the wine-press alone.” We must bear firmly upon
the burning ploughshare, and pass manfully through the ordeal,
for vengeance is His and He will repay.</p>
          <p>But there, in the sweet moonlight, as I looked upon this young
apostle of reform, a whole troop of thoughts less bitter than
these swept over my mind. There were gentle dreamings of a
home, a quiet home, in that Northland, where, at least, we are
countenanced as human beings. “Who,” I asked myself, “is this
mysterious Fred Douglas?” A black man he evidently was;
but how had I heard him spoken of? As one devoted to self-culture
in its noblest form, who ornamented society by his imposing
and graceful bearing, who electrified audiences with the
splendor of his rhetoric, and lured scholars to his presence by
the fame of his acquirements; and this man, this oracle of lore,
was of my race, of my blood. What he had done, others
might achieve. What a high determination then fired my
breast! Give, give me but the opportunity, and my chief ambition
will be to prove that we, though wronged and despised,
are not inferior to the proud Caucasians. I will strive to redeem
<pb id="browne83" n="83"/>
from unjust aspersion the name of my people. He, this
illustrious stranger, gave the first impetus to my ambition; from
him, my thoughts assumed a form, and one visible aim now
possessed my soul.</p>
          <p>How long I remained there listening I do not remember, for
soon the subject of conversation was changed, and I noted not
the particular words; but that mournfully musical voice had a
siren-charm for my ear, and I could not tear myself away.
Whilst listening to it, sweet sleep, like a shielding mantle, fell
upon me.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE CONVERSATION IN WHICH FEAR AND SUSPICION ARE
AROUSED—THE YOUNG MASTER.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>IT must have been long after midnight when I awoke. I do
not remember whether I had dreamed or not, but the slumber
had brought refreshment to my body and peace to my heart.</p>
          <p>I was aroused by the sound of voices, in a suppressed whisper,
or rather in a tone slightly above a whisper. I thought I
detected the voice of Lindy, and, as I rose from my recumbent
posture, I caught sight of a figure flitting round the gable of
these. I followed, but there was nothing visible. The pale
moonlight slept lovingly upon the dwelling and the roofs of
the out-buildings. Whither could the figure have fled? There
was no sign of any one having been there. Slowly and sadly
I directed my steps toward Aunt Polly's cabin. I opened the
door cautiously, not wishing to disturb her; but easy and
noiseless as were my motions, they roused that faithful creature.
She sprang from the bed, exclaiming:</p>
          <p>“La, Ann, whar has yer bin? I has bin so oneasy 'bout
yer.”</p>
          <p>With my native honesty I explained to her that I had been
beguiled by the melody of a human voice, and had lingered
long out in the autumn moonlight.</p>
          <p>“Yes; but, chile, you'll be sick. Sleepin' out a doors is berry
onwholesome like.”</p>
          <p>“Yes; but, Aunt Polly, there is an interior beat which no
autumnal frost has power to chill.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, chile, you does talk so pretty, like dem ar' great white
scholards. Many times I has wondered how a poor darkie
could larn so much. Now it 'pears to me as if you knowed
<pb id="browne85" n="85"/>
much as any ob 'em. I don't tink Miss Bradly hersef talks
any better dan you does.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Aunt Polly, your praise is sweet to me; but then, you
must remember not to do me more than justice. I am a poor,
illiterate mulatto girl, who has indeed improved the modicum of
time allowed her for self-culture; yet, when I hear such ladies
as Miss Bradly talk, I feel how far inferior I am to the queens
of the white tribe Often I ask myself why is this? Is it
because my face is colored? But then there is a voice, deep
down in my soul, that rejects such a conclusion as slanderous.
Oh, give me but opportunity, and I will strive to equal them in
learning.”</p>
          <p>“I don't see no use in yer wanting to larn, when you is
nothing but a poor slave. But I does think the gift of fine
speech mighty valable.”</p>
          <p>And here is another thing upon which I would generalize.
Does it not argue the possession of native mind—the immense
value the African places upon words—the high-flown and
broad-sounding words that he usually employs? The ludicrous
attempts which the most untutored make at grandiloquence, should
not so much provoke mirth as admiration in the more reflective
of the white race. Through what barriers and obstacles do not
their minds struggle to force a way up to the light. I have
often been astonished at the quickness with which they seized
upon expressions, and the accuracy with which they would apply
them. Every crude attempt which they make toward self-culture
is laughed at and scorned by the master, or treated as
the most puerile folly. No encouragement is given them. If,
by almost superhuman effort, they gain knowledge, why they
may; but, unaided and alone, they must work, as I have done.
Moreover, I have been wonder-stricken at the facility with which
the negro-boy acquires learning. 'Tis as though the rudiments
of the school came to him by flashes of intuition. He is allowed
only a couple of hours on Sunday afternoons for recitations, and
such odd moments during the week as he can catch to prepare his
lessons; for, a servant-boy often caught with his book in hand,
<pb id="browne86" n="86"/>
would be pronounced indolent, and punished as such. Then, how
unjust it is for the proud statesman—prouder of his snowy complexion
than of his stores of knowledge—how unjust, I say, is it in
him to assert, in the halls of legislation, that the colored race are
to the white far inferior in native mind! Has he weighed the
advantages and disadvantages of both? Has he remembered that
the whites, through countless generations, have been cultivated
and refined—familiarized with the arts and sciences and elegancies
of a graceful age, whilst the blacks are bound down in
ignorance; unschooled in lore; untrained in virtue; taught to
look upon themselves as degraded—the mere drudges of their
masters; debarred the privileges of social life; excluded from
books, with the products of their labor going toward the
enrichment of others? When, as in some solitary instance, a single
mind dares to break through the restraints and impediments
imposed upon it, does not the fact show of what strength the
race, when properly cared for, is capable? Is not the bulb,
which enshrouds the snowy leaves of the fragrant lily, an unsightly
thing? Does the uncut diamond show any of the polish
and brilliancy which the lapidary's band can give it? Thus is
it with the African mind. Let but the schoolmen breathe upon
it, let the architect of learning fashion it, and no diamond ever
glittered with more resplendence. With a more than prismatic
light, it will refract the beams of the sun of knowledge; and
the heart, the most noble African's heart, that now slumbers in
the bulb of ignorance, will burst forth, pure and lovely as the
white-petaled lily!</p>
          <p>I hope, kind reader, you will pardon these digressions, as I
write my inner as well as outer life, and I should be unfaithful
to my most earnest thoughts were I not to chronicle such reflections
as these. This book is not a wild romance to beguile your
tears and cheat your fancy. No; it is the truthful autobiography
of one who has suffered long, long, the pains and trials of slavery.
And she is committing her story, with her own calm deductions,
to the consideration of every thoughtful and truth-loving mind.</p>
          <p>“Where,” I asked Aunt Polly, “is Lindy?”</p>
          <pb id="browne87" n="87"/>
          <p>“Oh, chile, I doesn't know whar dat gal is. Sompen is de
matter wid her. She bin flyin' round here like somebody out
ob dar head. All's not right wid her, now you mark my words
fur it.”</p>
          <p>I then related to her the circumstance which had occurred
whilst I was under the window.</p>
          <p>“I does jist know dat was Lindy! You didn't see who she
was talkin' wid?”</p>
          <p>“No; and I did not distinctly discern her form; but the voice
I am confident was <sic corr="hers">her's</sic>.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sompen is gwine to happen; kase Lindy is berry
great coward, and I well knows 'twas sompen great dat would
make her be out dar at midnight.”</p>
          <p>“What do you think it means?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Why, lean up close to me, chile, while I jist whisper it low
like to you. I believe Lindy is gwine to run off.”</p>
          <p>I started back in terror. I felt the blood grow cold in my
veins. Why, if she made such an attempt as this, the whole
country would be scoured for her. Hot pursuers would be out
in every direction. And then her flight would render slavery
ten times more severe for us. Master would believe that we
were cognizant of it, and we should be put to torture for the
purpose of wringing from us something in regard to her. Then,
apprehension of our following her example would cause the reins
of authority to be even more tightly drawn. What wonder,
then, that fright possessed our minds, as the horrid suspicion
began to assume something like reality. We regarded each
other in silent horror. The dread workings of the fiend of fear
were visible in the livid hue which overspread my companion's
lace and shone in the glare of her aged eye. She clasped her
skinny hands together, and cried.</p>
          <p>“Oh, my chile, orful times is comin' fur us. While Lindy
will be off in that 'lightful Canady, we will be here sufferin' all
sorts of trouble. Oh, de Lord, if dar be any, hab marcy on us!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Aunt Polly, don't say ‘if there be any;’ for, so certain
as we both sit here, there is a Lord who made us, and who cares
<pb id="browne88" n="88"/>
for us, too. We are as much the children of His love as are the
whites.”</p>
          <p>“Oh Lord, chile, I kan't belieb it; fur, if he loves us, why
does he make us suffer so, an' let de white folks hab such an
easy time?”</p>
          <p>“He has some wise purpose in it. And then in that Eternity
which succeeds the grave, he will render us blest and happy.”</p>
          <p>The clouds of ignorance hung too thick and close around her
mind; and the poor old woman did not see the justice of such
a decree. She was not to blame if, in her woeful ignorance,
she yielded to unbelief; and, with a profanity which knowledge
would have rebuked, dared to boldly question the Divine Purpose.
This sin, also, is at the white man's door.</p>
          <p>I did not strive further to enlighten her; for, be it confessed,
I was myself possessed by physical fear to an unwonted degree.
I did not think of courting sleep. The brief dream which had
fallen upon me as I slept beneath the parlor window, had given
me sufficient refreshment. And as for Aunt Polly, she was too
much frightened to think of sleep. Talk we did, long and
earnestly. I mentioned to her what I had heard Misses Tildy
and Jane say in regard to Amy.</p>
          <p>“Poor thing,” exclaimed Aunt Polly, “she'll not be able to
stand it, for her heart is wrapped up in dat ar' chile's. She
'pears like its mother.”</p>
          <p>“I hope they may change their intentions,” I ventured to say.</p>
          <p>“No; neber. When wonst Miss Jane gets de notion ob
finery in her head, she is gwine to hab it. Lord lub you, Ann,
I does wish dey would sell you and me.”</p>
          <p>“So do I,” was my fervent reply.</p>
          <p>“But dey will neber sell you, kase Miss Jane tinks you is
good-lookin', an' I hearn her say she would like to hab a
nice-lookin' maid. You see she tinks it is 'spectable.”</p>
          <p>“I suppose I must bear my cross and crown of thorns with
patience.”</p>
          <p>Just then little Ben groaned in his sleep, and quickly his
ever-watchful guardian was aroused; she bent over him, soothing his
<pb id="browne89" n="89"/>
perturbed sleep with a low song. Many were the endearing
epithets which she employed, such as, “Pretty little Benny,
nothing shall hurt you.” “Bless your little heart,” and “here
I is by yer side,” “I'll keep de bars way frum yer.”</p>
          <p>“Poor child,” burst involuntarily from my lips, as I reflected
that even that one only treasure would soon be taken from
her; then in what a hopeless eclipse would sink every ray of
mind. Hearing my exclamation, she sprung up, and eagerly
asked,</p>
          <p>“What is de matter, Ann? Why is you and Aunt Polly
sittin' up at dis time ob de night? It's most day; say, is
anything gwine on?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing at all,” I answered, “only Aunt Polly does not
feel very well, and I am sitting up talking with her.”</p>
          <p>Thus appeased, she returned to her bed (if such a miserable
thing could be called a bed), and was soon sleeping soundly.</p>
          <p>Aunt Polly wiped her eyes as she said to me,</p>
          <p>“Ann, doesn't we niggers hab to bar a heap? We works
hard, and gits nothing but scanty vittels, de scraps dat de white
folks leabes, and den dese miserable old rags dat only half
kevers our nakedness. I declare it is too hard to bar.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I answered, “it is hard, very hard, and enough to
shake the endurance of the most determined martyr; yet,
often do I repeat to myself those divine words, ‘The <sic corr="cup">cap</sic>
which my Father has given me will I drink;’ and then I feel
calmed, strong, and heroic.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, chile, you does talk so beautiful, an' you has got

          <p>“Oh, would that I could think so. Would that my soul were
more patient. I am not sufficiently hungered and athirst
after righteousness. I pant too much for the joys of earth. I
crave worldly inheritance, whilst the Christian's true aim should.
be for the mansions of the blest.”</p>
          <p>Thus wore on the night in social conversation, and I forgot,
in that free intercourse, that there was a difference between us.
The heart takes not into consideration the distinction of mind.
<pb id="browne90" n="90"/>
Love banishes all thought of rank or inequality. By her
kindness and confidence, this old woman made me forget her
ignorance.</p>
          <p>When the first red streak of day began to announce the
slow coming of the sun, Aunt Polly was out, and about her
breakfast arrangements.</p>
          <p>Since the illness of Master, and the departure of Mr. Jones,
things had not gone on with the same precision as before.
There was a few minutes difference in the blowing of the horn;
and, for offences like these, Master had sworn deeply that
“every nigger's hide” should be striped, as soon as he was able
to preside at the “post.” During his sickness he had not
allowed one of us to enter his room; “for,” as he said to the doctor,
“a cussed nigger made him feel worse, he wanted to be
up and beatin' them. They needed the cowhide every breath
they drew.” And, as the sapient doctor decided that our presence
had an exciting effect upon him, we were banished from
his room. “<hi rend="italics">Banished!</hi>—what's banished but set free!”</p>
          <p>Now, when I rose from my seat, and bent over the form of Amy,
and watched her as she lay wrapt in a profound sleep, with one arm
encircling little Ben, and the two sisters, Jane and Luce, lying
close to her—so dependent looked the three, as they thus
huddled round their young protectress, so loving and trustful in
that deep repose, that I felt now would be a good time for the
angel Death to come—now, before the fatal fall of the
Damoclesian sword, whose hair thread was about to snap: but no
—Death comes not at our bidding; he obeys a higher appointment.
The boy moaned again in his sleep, and Amy's faithful
arm was tightened round him. Closer she drew him to her
maternal heart, and in a low, gurgling, songful voice, lulled him
to a sweeter rest. I turned away from the sight, and, sinking
on my knees, offered up a prayer to Him our common Father. I
prayed that strength might be furnished me to endure the torture
which I feared would come with the labors of the day<corr>.</corr> I
asked, in an especial way, for grace to be given to the child,
Amy. God is merciful! He moves in a mysterious manner.
<pb id="browne91" n="91"/>
All power comes direct from Him; and, oh, did I not feel
that this young creature had need of grace to bear the burden
that others were preparing for her!</p>
          <p>My business was to clean the house and set to rights the young
ladies' apartment, and then assist Lindy in the breakfast-room;
but I dared not venture in the ladies' chamber until half-past
six o'clock, as the slightest foot-fall would arouse Miss Jane,
who, I think, was too nervous to sleep. Thus I was left some
little time to myself; and these few moments I generally devoted
to reading some simple story-book or chapters in the New
Testament. Of course, the mighty mysteries of the sacred volume
were but imperfectly appreciated by me. I read the book
more as a duty than a pleasure; but this morning I could not read.
Christ's beautiful parable of the Ten Virgins, which has such a
wondrous significance even to the most childish mind, failed to
impart interest, and the blessed page fell from my hands unread.</p>
          <p>I then thought I would go to the kitchen and assist Aunt
Polly. I found her very much excited, and in close conversation
with our master's son John, whom the servants familiarly
addressed as “young master.”</p>
          <p>I have, as yet, forborne all direct and special mention of him,
though he was by no means a person lacking interest. Unlike
his father and sisters, he was gentle in disposition, full of loving
kindness; yet he was so taciturn, that we had seldom an indication
of that generosity that burned so intensely in the very centre
of his soul, and which subsequent events called forth. His sisters
pronounced him stupid; and, in the choice phraseology of his
father, he was “poke-easy;” but the poor, undiscriminating black
people, called him gentle. To me he said but little; yet that
little was always kindly spoken, and I knew it to be the dictate
of a soft, humane spirit.</p>
          <p>Fair-haired with deep blue eyes, a snowy complexion and
pensive manners, he glided by us, ever recalling to my mind
the thoughts of seraphs. He was now fifteen years of age, but
small of stature and slight of sinew, with a mournful expression
and dejected eye, as though the burden of a great sorrow had
<pb id="browne92" n="92"/>
been early laid upon him. During all my residence there, I
had never heard him laugh loud or seen him run. He had none
of that exhilaration and buoyancy which are so captivating in
childhood. If he asked a favor of even a servant, he always
expressed a hope that he had given no trouble. When a slave
was to be whipped, he would go off and conceal himself somewhere
and never was he a spectator of any cruelty; yet he
did not remonstrate with his father or intercede for the victims.
No one had ever heard him speak against the diabolical acts of
his father; yet all felt that he condemned them, for there was
a silent expression of reproof in the earnest gaze which he
sometimes gave him. I always fancied when the boy came near
me, that there was about him a religion, which, like the wondrous
virtue of the Saviour's garment, was manifest only when you
approached near enough to touch it. It was not expressed in
any open word, or made evident by any signal act, but, like the
life-sustaining air which we daily breathe, we knew it only
through its beneficent though invisible influence.</p>

            <p>THE FLIGHT—YOUNG MASTER'S APPREHENSIONS—HIS CONVERSATION—AMY—EDIFYING TALK AMONG LADIES.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I WAS not a little surprised to find young master now in an
apparently earnest colloquy with Aunt Polly. A deep carnation
spot burned upon his cheeks, and his soft eye was purple in its
intensity.</p>
          <p>“What is the matter?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Lor, chile,” replied Aunt Polly, “Lindy can't be found
nowhar.”</p>
          <p>“Has every place been searched?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said little John, “and she is nowhere to be found.”</p>
          <p>“Does master know it?”</p>
          <p>“Not yet, and I hope it may be kept from him for some time,
at least two or three hours,” he replied, with a mournful earnestness
of tone.</p>
          <p>“Why? Is he not well enough to bear the excitement of
it?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>The boy fixed his large and wondering eyes upon me. His
gaze, lingered for a minute or two; it was enough; I read his
inmost thoughts, and in my secret soul I revered him, for I bowed
to the majesty of a heaven-born soul. Such spirits are indeed
few. God lends them to earth for but a short time; and we
should entertain them well, for, though they come in forms
unrecognized, yet must we, despite the guise of humanity, do
reverence to the shrined seraph. This boy now became to me an
object of more intense interest. I felt assured, by the power
of that magnetic glance, that he was not unacquainted with the
facts of Lindy's flight.</p>
          <pb id="browne94" n="94"/>
          <p>“How far is it from here to the river?” he said, as if speaking
with himself, “nine miles—let me see—the Ohio once gained,
and crossed, they are comparatively safe.”</p>
          <p>He started suddenly, as if he had been betrayed or beguiled
of his secret, and starting up quickly, walked away. I followed
him to the door, and watched his delicate form and golden head,
until he disappeared in a curve of the path which led to the
spring. That was a favorite walk with him. Early in the
morning (for he rose before the lark) and late in the twilight,
alike in winter or summer, he pursued his walk. Never once
did I see him with a book in his hand. With his eye upturned
to the heavens or bent upon the earth, he seemed to be reading
Nature's page. He had made no great proficiency in
book-knowledge; and, indeed, as he subsequently told me, he had
read nothing but the Bible. The stories of the Old Testament
he had committed to memory, and could repeat with great accuracy.
That of Joseph possessed a peculiar fascination for him.
As I closed the kitchen door and rejoined Aunt Polly, she
remarked,</p>
          <p>“Jist as I sed, Lindy is off, and we is left here to hab trouble;
oh, laws, look for sights now!”</p>
          <p>I made no reply, but silently set about assisting her in getting
breakfast. Shortly after old Nace came in, with a strange
expression lighting up his fiendish face.</p>
          <p>“Has you hearn de news?” And without waiting for a reply,
he went on, “Lindy is off fur Kanaday! ha, ha, ha!” and he
broke out in a wild laugh; “I guess dat dose 'ere hounds will
scent her path sure enoff; I looks out for fun in rale arnest. I
jist hopes I'll be sint fur her, and I'll scour dis airth but what I
finds her.”</p>
          <p>And thus he rambled on, in a diabolical way, neither of us
heeding him. He seemed to take no notice of our silence, being
too deeply interested in the subject of his thoughts.</p>
          <p>“I'd like to know at what hour she started off. Now, she
was a smart one to git off so slick, widout lettin' anybody know
ob it. She had no close worth takin' wid her, so she ken run
<pb id="browne95" n="95"/>
de, faster. I wish masser would git wake, kase I wants to be de
fust one to tell him ob it.”</p>
          <p>Just then the two field-hands, Jake and Dan, came in.</p>
          <p>“Wal,” cried the former, “dis am news indeed. Lindy's off
fur sartin. Now she tinks she is some, I reckon.”</p>
          <p>“And why shouldn't she?” asked Dan, a big, burly negro,
good-natured, but very weak in mind; of a rather low and sensuous
nature, yet of a good and careless humor—the best worker
upon the farm. I looked round at him as he said this, for I
thought there was reason as well as feeling in the speech. Why
shouldn't she be both proud and happy at the success of her
bold plan, if it gains her liberty and enables her to reach that
land where the law would recognize her as possessed of rights?
I could almost envy her such a lot.</p>
          <p>“I guess she'll find her Kanady down de river, by de time de
dogs gits arter her,” said Nace, with another of his ha, ha's.</p>
          <p>“I wonder who Masser will send fur her? I bound, Nace,
you'll be sent,” said Jake.</p>
          <p>“Yes, if dar is any fun, I is sure to be dar; but hurry up yer
hoe-cakes, old 'ooman, so dat de breakfust will be ober, and we
can hab an airly start.”</p>
          <p>The latter part of this speech was addressed to Aunt Polly,
who turned round and brandished the poker toward him, saying,</p>
          <p>“Go 'bout yer business, Nace; kase you is got cause fur joy,
it is not wort my while to be glad. You is an old fool, dat
nobody keres 'bout, no how. I spects you would be glad to run
off, too, if yer old legs was young enuff fur to carry you.”</p>
          <p>“Me, Poll, I wouldn't be free if I could, kase, you see, I has
done sarved my time at de ‘post,’ and now I is Masser's head-man,
and I gits none ob de beatings. It is fun fur me to see de oders.”</p>
          <p>I turned my eyes upon him, and he looked so like a beast
that I shut out any feeling of resentment I might otherwise
have entertained. Amy came in, bearing little Ben in her arms,
followed by her two sisters, Jinny and Lucy.</p>
          <p>“La, Aunt Polly, is Lindy gone?” and her blank eyes opened
to an unusual width, as she half-asked, half-asserted this fact.</p>
          <pb id="browne96" n="96"/>
          <p>“Yes, but what's it to you, Amy?”</p>
          <p>“I jist hear 'em say so, as I was comin' along.”</p>
          <p>“Whar she be gone to?” asked Lucy.</p>
          <p>“None ob yer bisness,” replied Aunt Polly, with her usual
gruffness.</p>
          <p>Strange it was, that, when she was alone with me, she appeared
to wax soft and gentle in her nature; but, when with
others, she was “wolfish.” It seemed as if she had two natures.
Now, with Nace, she was as vile and almost as inhuman as he;
but I, who knew her heart truly, felt that she was doing herself
injustice. I did not laugh or join in their talk, but silently
worked on.</p>
          <p>“Now, you see, Ann is one ob de proud sort, kase she ken
read, and her face is yaller; she tinks to hold herself 'bove us;
but I 'members de time when Masser buyed her at de sale.
Lor' lub yer, but she did cry when she lef her mammy; and de
way old Kais flung herself on de ground, ha! ha! it makes me
laf now.”</p>
          <p>I turned my eyes upon him, and, I fear, there was anything
but a Christian spirit beaming therefrom. He had touched a
chord in my heart which was sacred to memory, love, and
silence. My mother! Could I bear to have her name and
her sorrow thus rudely spoken of? Oh, God, what fierce and
fiendish feelings did the recollection of her agony arouse?
With burning head and thorn-pierced heart, I turned back a
blotted page in life. Again, with horror stirring my blood,
did I see her in that sweat of mortal agony, and hear that
shriek that rung from her soul! Oh, God, these memories are
a living torture to me, even now. But though Nace had touched
the tenderest, sorest part of my heart, I said nothing to him.
The strange workings of my countenance attracted Amy's
attention, and, coming up to me, with an innocent air, she asked:</p>
          <p>“What is the matter, Ann? Has anything happened to you?”</p>
          <p>These questions, put by a simple child, one, too, whose own
young life had been deeply acquainted with grief, were too much
for my assumed stolidity<corr/> Tears were the only reply I could
<pb id="browne97" n="97"/>
make. The child regarded me curiously, and the expression,
“poor thing,” burst from her lips. I felt grateful for even her
sympathy, and put my hand out to her.</p>
          <p>She grasped it, and, leaning close to me, said:</p>
          <p>“Don't cry, Ann; me is sorry fur you. Don't cry any
more.”</p>
          <p>Poor thing, she could feel sympathy; she, who was so loaded
with trouble, whose existence had none of the freshness and
vernal beauty of youth, but was seared and blighted like age,
held in the depths of her heart a pure drop of genuine sympathy,
which she freely offered me. Oh, did not my selfishness
stand rebuked.</p>
          <p>Looking out of the window, far down the path that wound to
the spring, I descried the fair form of the young John, advancing
toward the house. Pale and pure, with his blue eyes
pensively looking up to heaven, an air of peaceful thought and
subdued emotion was breathing from his very form. When I
looked at him, he suggested the idea of serenity. There was
that about him which, like the moonlight, inspired calm. He
was walking more rapidly than I had ever seen him; but the
pallor of his cheek, and the clear, cold blue of his heaven-lit
eye, harmonized but poorly with the jarring discords of life. I
thought of the pure, passionless apostle John, whom Christ
so loved<corr sic="?">.</corr> And did I not dream that this youth, too, had on
earth a mission of love to perform? Was he not one of the
sacred chosen? He came walking slowly, as if he were
communing with some invisible presence<corr sic=",">.</corr></p>
          <p>“Thar comes young Masser, and I is glad, kase he looks
so good like. I does lub him,” said Amy.</p>
          <p>“Now, I is gwine fur to tell Masser, and he will gib you a
beatin', nigger-gal, for sayin' you lub a white gemman,” replied
the sardonic Nace.</p>
          <p>“Oh, please don't tell on me. I did not mean any harm,”
and she burst into tears, well-knowing that a severe whipping
would be the reward of her construed impertinence.</p>
          <p>Before I had time to offer her any consolation, the subject
<pb id="browne98" n="98"/>
of conversation himself stood among us. With a low, tuneful
voice, he spoke to Amy, inquiring the cause of her tears.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Young Masser, I did not mean any harm. Please don't
hab me beat.” Little Ben joined in her tears, whilst the two
girls clung fondly to her dress.</p>
          <p>“Beaten for what?” asked young master, in a most
encouraging manner.</p>
          <p>“She say she lub you—jist as if a black wench hab any
right to lub a beautiful white gemman,” put in Nace.</p>
          <p>“I am glad she does, and wish that I could do something
that would make her love me more.” And a <hi rend="italics">beatific</hi> smile
overspread his peaceful face. “Come, poor Amy, let me see if
I haven't some little present for you,” and he drew from his
pocket a picayune, which he handed her. With a wild and
singular contortion of her body, she made an acknowledgment of
thanks, and kissing the hem of his robe, she darted off from
the kitchen, with little Ben in her arms.</p>
          <p>Without saying one word, young master walked away from
the kitchen, but not without first casting a sorrowful look upon
Nace. Strange it seemed to me, that this noble youth never
administered a word of reproof to any one. He conveyed all
rebukes by means of looks. Upon me this would have produced
a greater impression, for those mild, reproachful eyes
spoke with a power which no language could equal; but on
one of Nace's obtuseness, it had no effect whatever.</p>
          <p>Shortly after, I left the kitchen, and went to the breakfast-room,
where, with the utmost expedition, I arranged the table,
and then repaired to the chamber of the young ladies. I found
that they had already risen from their bed. Miss Bradly
(who had spent the night with them) was standing at the mirror,
braiding her long hair. Miss Jane was seated in a large
chair, with an elegant dressing-wrapper, waiting for me to comb
her “auburn hair,” as she termed it. Miss Tildy, in a lazy attitude,
was talking about the events of the previous evening.</p>
          <p>“Now, Miss Emily, I do think him very handsome; but I
cannot forgive his gross Abolition sentiments.”</p>
          <pb id="browne99" n="99"/>
          <p>“How horribly vulgar and low he is in his notions,” said Miss
Jane.</p>
          <p>“Oh, but, girls, he was reared in the North, with those fanatical
Abolitionists, and we can scarcely blame him.”</p>
          <p>“What a horrible set of men those Abolitionists must be.
They have no sense,” said Miss Jane, with quite a Minerva
air.</p>
          <p>“Oh, sense they assuredly have, but judgment they lack.
They are a set of brain-sick dreamers, filled with Utopian
schemes. They know nothing of Slavery as it exists at the
South; and the word, which, I confess, has no very pleasant
sound, has terrified them.” This remark was made by Miss
Bradly, and so astonished me that I fixed my eyes upon her,
and, with one look, strove to express the concentrated contempt
and bitterness of my nature. This look she did not seem to
heed. With strange feelings of distrust in the integrity of human
nature, I went on about my work, which was to arrange
and deck Miss Jane's hair, but I would have given worlds not to
have felt toward Miss Bradly as I did. I remembered with what
a different spirit she had spoken to me of those Abolitionists,
whom she now contemned so much, and referred to as vain
dreamers. Where was the exalted philanthropy that I had
thought dwelt in her soul? Was she not, now, the weakest and
most sordid of mortals? Where was that far and heaven-reaching
love that had seemed to encircle her as a living, burning zone?
Gone! dissipated, like a golden mist! and now, before my sight
she stood, poor and a beggar, upon the great highway of life.</p>
          <p>“I can tell you,” said Miss Tildy, “I read the other day in a
newspaper that the reason these northern men are so strongly
in favor of the abolition of slavery is, that they entertain a prejudice
against the South, and that all this political warfare
originated in the base feeling of envy.”</p>
          <p>“And that is true,” put in Miss Jane; “they know that cotton,
rice and sugar are the great staples of the South, and
where can you find any laborers but negroes to produce them?”</p>
          <p>“Could not the poor class of whites go there and work for
<pb id="browne100" n="100"/>
wages?” pertinently asked Miss Tildy, who had a good deal of
the spirit of altercation in her.</p>
          <p>“No, of course not; because they are free and could not be
made to work at all times. They would consent to be employed
only at certain periods. They would not work when they were
in the least sick, and they would, because of their liberty, claim
certain hours as their own; whereas the slave has no right to
interpose any word against the overseer's order. Sick or well,
he <hi rend="italics">must</hi> work at busy seasons of the year. The whip has a
terribly sanitary power, and has been proven to be a more
efficient remedy than rhubarb or senna.” After delivering herself
of this wonderful argument, Miss Jane seemed to experience
great relief. Miss Bradly turned from the mirror, and, smiling
sycophantically upon her, said: “Why, my dear, how well
you argue! You are a very Cicero in debate.”</p>
          <p>That was enough. This compliment took ready root in the
shallow mind of the receiver, and her love for Miss B. became
greater than ever.</p>
          <p>“But I do think him so handsome,” broke from Miss Tildy's
lips, in a half audible voice.</p>
          <p>“Whom?” asked Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>“Why, the stranger of last evening; the fair-browed Robert
Worth.”</p>
          <p>“Handsome, indeed, is he!” was the reply.</p>
          <p>“I hope, Matilda Peterkin, you would not be so disloyal to
the South, and to the very honorable institution under which
your father accumulated his wealth, as to even admire a low-flung
northern Abolitionist;” and Miss Jane reddened with all
a <sic corr="Southren's">Southron's</sic> ire.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly was about to speak, but to what purpose the
world to this day remains ignorant, for oath after oath, and
blasphemy by the volley, so horrible that I will spare myself
and the reader the repetition, proceeded from the room of Mr.
Peterkin.</p>
          <p>The ladies sprang to their feet, and, in terror, rushed from
the apartment.</p>

            <p>MR. PETERKIN'S RAGE—ITS ESCAPE—CHAT AT THE
BREAKFAST TABLE—CHANGE OF VIEWS—POWER OF THE
FLESH POTS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>IT was as I had expected; the news of Lindy's flight had
been communicated by Nace to Mr. Peterkin, and his rage
knew no limits. It was dangerous to go near him. Raving
like a madman, he tore the covering of the bed to shreds,
brandished his cowhide in every direction, took down his gun, and
swore he would “shoot every d—d nigger on the place.”
His daughters had no influence over him. Out of bed he
would get, declaring that “all this devilment” would not have
been perpetrated if he had not been detained there by the order
of that d—d doctor, who had no reason for keeping him
there but a desire to get his money. Fearing that his hyena
rage might vent some of its gall on them, the ladies made no
further opposition to his intention.</p>
          <p>Standing just without the door, I heard Miss Jane ask him
if he would not first take some breakfast.</p>
          <p>“No; cuss your breakfast. I want none of it; I want to
be among them ar' niggers, and give 'em a taste of this cowhide,
that they have been sufferin' fur.”</p>
          <p>In affright I fled to the kitchen, and told Aunt Polly that the
storm had at length broken in all its fury. Each one of the
negroes eyed the others in silent dismay.</p>
          <p>Pale with rage and debility, hot fury flashing from his eye,
and white froth gathering upon his lips, Mr. Peterkin dashed
into the kitchen. “In the name of h—ll and its fires, niggers,
what does this mean? Tell me whar that d—d gal is, or I'll
cut every mother's child of you to death.”</p>
          <pb id="browne102" n="102"/>
          <p>Not one spoke. Lash after lash he dealt in every direction.</p>
          <p>“Speak, h—ll  hounds, or I'll throttle you!” he cried, as he
caught Jake and Dan by the throat, with each hand, and half
strangled them. With their eyes rolling, and their tongues
hanging from their mouths, they had not power to answer. As
soon as he loosened his grasp, and their voices were sufficiently
their own to speak, they attempted a denial; but a blow from
each of Mr. Peterkin's fists levelled them to the floor. In this
dreadful state, and with a hope of getting a moment's respite,
Jake (poor fellow, I forgive him for it) pointed to me, saying:</p>
          <p>“She knows all 'bout it.”</p>
          <p>This had the desired effect; finding one upon whom he could
vent his whole wrath, Peterkin rushed up to me, and Oh, such a
blow as descended upon my head! Fifty stars blazed around
me. My brain burned and ached; a choking rush of tears
filled my eyes and throat. “Mercy! mercy!” broke from my
agonized lips; but, alas! I besought it from a tribunal where it
was not to be found. Blow after blow he dealt me. I strove not
to parry them, but stood and received them, as, right and left,
they fell like a hail-storm. Tears and blood bathed my face
and blinded my sight. “You cussed fool, I'll make you rue
the day you was born, if you hide from me what you knows
'bout it.”</p>
          <p>I asseverated, in the most solemn way, that I knew nothing
of Lindy's flight.</p>
          <p>“You are a liar,” he cried out, and enforced his words with
another blow.</p>
          <p>“She is not,” cried Aunt Polly, whose forbearance had now
given out. This unexpected boldness in one of the most humble
and timid of his slaves, enraged him still farther, and he dealt
her such a blow that my heart aches even now, as I think
of it.</p>
          <p>A summons from one of the ladies recalled him to the house.
Before leaving he pronounced a desperate threat against us,
which amounted to this—that we should all be tied to the
“post,” and beaten until confession was wrung from us, and then
<pb id="browne103" n="103"/>
taken to L—, and sold to a trader, for the southern market.
But I did not share, with the others, that wondrous dread of
the fabled horror of “down the river.” I did not believe that
anywhere slavery existed in a more brutal and cruel form than
in the section of Kentucky where I lived. Solitary instances
of kind and indulgent masters there were; but they were the
few exceptions to the almost universal rule.</p>
          <p>Now, when Mr. Peterkin withdrew, I, forgetful of my own
wounds, lifted Aunt Polly in my arms, and bore her, half senseless,
to the cabin, and laid her upon her ragged bed. “Great God!”
I exclaimed, as I bent above her, “can this thing last long?
How much longer will thy divine patience endure? How much
longer must we bear this scourge, this crown of thorns, this
sweat of blood? Where and with what Calvary shall this
martyrdom terminate? Oh, give me patience, give me fortitude, to
bow to Thy will! Sustain me, Jesus, Thou who dost know,
hast tasted of humanity's bitterest cup, give me grace to bear
yet a little longer!”</p>
          <p>With this prayer upon my lips I rose from the bedside where
I had been kneeling, and, taking Aunt Polly's horny hands
within my own, I commenced chafing them tenderly. I bathed
her temples with cold water. She opened her eyes languidly,
looked round the room slowly, and then fixed them upon me,
with a bewildered expression. I spoke to her in a gentle tone;
she pushed me some distance from her, eyed me with a vacant
glance, then, shaking her head, turned over on her side and
closed her eyes. Believing that she was stunned and faint from
the blow she had received, I thought it best that she should
sleep awhile. Gently spreading the coverlet over her, I returned
to the kitchen, where the affrighted group of negroes
yet remained. Stricken by a panic they had not power of
volition.</p>
          <p>Casting one look of reproach upon Jake, I turned away,
intending to go and see if the ladies required my attention in the
breakfast-room; but in the entry, which separated the house from
the kitchen, I encountered Amy, with little Ben seated upon her
<pb id="browne104" n="104"/>
hip. This is the usual mode with nurses in Kentucky of carrying
children. I have seen girls actually deformed from the practice.
An enlargement of the right hip is caused by it, and
Amy was an example of this. Had I been in a different mood,
her position and appearance would have provoked laughter.
There she stood, with her broad eyes wide open, and glaring
upon me; her unwashed face and uncombed hair were adorned
by the odd ends of broken straws and bits of hay that clung
to the naps of wool; her mouth was opened to its utmost
capacity; her very ears were erect with curiosity; and her
form bent eagerly forward, whilst little Ben was coiled up on
her hip, with his sharp eyes peering like those of a mouse
over her shoulder.</p>
          <p>“Ann,” she cried out, “tell me what's de matter? What's
Masser goin' to do wid us all?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, Amy,” I answered in a faltering tone, for I
feared much for her.</p>
          <p>“I hopes de child'en will go 'long wid me, an' I'd likes for
you to go too, Ann.”</p>
          <p>I did not trust myself to reply; but, passing hastily on, entered
the breakfast-room, where Jane, Tildy, and Miss Bradly
were seated at the table, with their breakfast scarcely tasted.
They were bending over their plates in an intensity of interest
which made them forget everything, save their subject of
conversation.</p>
          <p>“How she could have gotten off without creating any alarm, is
to me a mystery,” said Miss Jane, as she toyed with her spoon
and cup.</p>
          <p>“Well, old Nick is in them. Negroes, I believe, are possessed
by some demon. They have the witch's power of slipping
through an auger-hole,” said Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“They are singular creatures,” replied Miss Bradly; “and I
fear a great deal of useless sympathy is expended upon them.”</p>
          <p>“You may depend there is,” said Miss Jane. “I only wish
these Northern abolitionists had our servants to deal with. I
think it would drive the philanthropy out of them.”</p>
          <pb id="browne105" n="105"/>
          <p>“Indeed would it,” answered Miss Bradly, as she took
a warm roll, and busied herself spreading butter thereon;
“they have no idea of the trials attending the duty of a master;
the patience required in the management of so many
different dispositions. I think a residence in the South or
South-west would soon change their notions. The fact is, I
think those fanatical abolitionists agitate the question only for
political purposes. Now, it is a clearly-ascertained thing, that
slavery would be prejudicial to the advancement of Northern
enterprise. The negro is an exotic from a tropical region, hence
lives longer, and is capable of more work in a warm climate.
They have no need of black labor at the North; and thus, I
think, the whole affair resolves itself into a matter of sectional
gain and interest.”</p>
          <p>Here she helped herself to the wing of a fried chicken. It
seemed that the argument had considerably whetted her appetite.
Astonishing is it not, how the loaves and fishes of this
goodly life will change and sway our opinions? Even sober-minded,
educated people, cannot repress their pinings after the
flesh-pots of Egypt.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane seemed delighted to find that her good friend and
instructress held the Abolition party in such contempt. Just
then young master entered. With quiet, saintly manner,
taking his seat at the table, he said,</p>
          <p>“Is not the abolition power strong at the North, Miss Emily?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, no, Johnny, 'tis comparatively small; confined, I
assure you, to a few fanatical spirits. The merchants of New
York, Boston, and the other Northern cities, carry on a too
extensive commerce with the South to adopt such dangerous
sentiments. There is a comity of men as well as States; and the
clever rule of ‘let alone’ is pretty well observed.”</p>
          <p>Young master made no reply in words, but fixed his large,
mysterious eyes steadfastly upon her. Was it mournfulness
that streamed, with a purple light, from them, or was it
a sublimated contempt? He said nothing; but quietly ate his
breakfast. His fare was as homely as that of an ascetic; he
<pb id="browne106" n="106"/>
never used meat, and always took bread without butter, A
simple crust and glass of milk, three times a day, was his diet.
Miss Jane gave him a careless and indifferent glance, then
proceeded with the conversation, totally unconscious of his
presence; but again and again he cast furtive, anxious glances
toward her, and I thought I noticed him sighing.</p>
          <p>“What will father do with Lindy, if she should be caught?”
asked Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Send her down the river, of course,” was Miss Jane's
response.</p>
          <p>“She deserves it,” said Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Does she?” asked the deep, earnest voice of young master.</p>
          <p>Was it because he was unused to asking questions, or was
there something in the strange earnestness of his tone, that
made those three ladies start so suddenly, and regard him with
such an astonished air? Yet none of them replied, and thus
for a few moments conversation ceased, until he rose from the
table and left the room.</p>
          <p>“He is a strange youth,” said Miss Bradly, “and how
wondrously handsome! He always suggests romantic notions.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but I think him very stupid. He never talks to any
of us—is always alone, seeks old and unfrequented spots;
neither in the winter nor summer will he remain within doors.
Something seems to lure him to the wood, even when despoiled
of its foliage. He must be slightly crazed—ma's health was
feeble for some time previous to his birth, which the doctors
say has injured his constitution, and I should not be surprised
if his intellect had likewise suffered.” This speech was pronounced
by Miss Tildy in quite an oracular tone.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly made no answer, and I marvelled not at her
changing color. Had she not power to read, in that noble
youth's voice and manner, the high enduring truth and
singleness of purpose that dwelt in his nature? Though he
had never spoken one word in relation to slavery, I knew that
all his instincts were against it; and that opposition to it was
the principle deeply ingrained in his heart.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>RECOLLECTIONS—CONSOLING INFLUENCE OF SYMPATHY—AMY'S DOCTRINE OF THE SOUL—TALK AT THE SPRING.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>As Mr. Peterkin was passing through the vestibule of the
front door, he met young master standing there. Now, this
was Mr. Peterkin's favorite child, for, though he did not altogether
like that quietude of manner, which he called “poke-easy,”
the boy had never offered him any affront about his incorrect
language, or treated him with indignity in any way.
And then he was so beautiful! True, his father could not appreciate
the spiritual nobility of his face; yet the symmetry of his
features and the spotless purity of his complexion, answered
even to Mr. Peterkin's idea of beauty. The coarsest and most
vulgar soul is keenly alive to the beauty of the rose and lily;
though that concealed loveliness, which is only hinted at by the
rare fragrance, may be known only to the cultivated and poetic
heart. Often I have heard him say, “John is pretty enoff to be
a gal.”</p>
          <p>Now as he met him in the vestibule, he said, “John, I'm in a
peck o' trouble.”</p>
          <p>“I am sorry you are in trouble father.”</p>
          <p>“That cussed black wench, Lindy, is off, and I'm 'fraid the
neighborhood kant be waked up soon enough to go arter and
ketch her. Let me git her once more in my clutches, and I'll
make her pay for it. I'll give her one good bastin' that she'll
'member, and then I'll send her down the river fur enough.”</p>
          <p>The boy made no reply; but, with his eyes cast down on the
earth, he seemed to be unconscious of all that was going on
around him. When he raised his head his eyes were burning,
his breath came thick and short, and a deep scarlet spot shone
<pb id="browne108" n="108"/>
on the whiteness of his cheek; the veins in his forehead lay
like heavy cords, and his very hair seemed to sparkle. He
looked as one inspired. This was unobserved by his parent,
who hastily strode away to find more willing listeners. I tarried
in a place where, unnoticed by others, I commanded a good
out-look. I saw young master clasp his hands fervently, and
heard him passionately exclaim “How much longer, oh,
how much longer shall this be?” Then slowly walking down
his favorite path, he was lost to my vision. “Blessed youth,
heaven-missioned, if thou wouldst only speak to me! One
word of consolation from God-anointed lips like thine, would
soothe even the sting of bondage; but no,” I added, “that
earnest look, that gentle tone, tell perhaps as much as it is
necessary for me to know. This silence proceeds from some
noble motive. Soon enough he will make himself known to
us.”</p>
          <p>In a little while the news of Lindy's departure had spread
through the neighborhood like a flame. Our yard and house
were filled with men come to offer their services to their
neighbor, who, from his wealth, was considered a sort of magnate
among them.</p>
          <p>Pretty soon they were mounted on horses, and armed to the
teeth, each one with a horn fastened to his belt, galloping off in
quest of the poor fugitive. And is this thing done beneath the
influence of civilized laws, and by men calling themselves
Christians? What has armed those twelve men with pistols,
and sent them on an <sic corr="excursion">excursion</sic> like this? Is it to redeem a
brother from a band of lawless robbers, who hold him in
captivity? Is it to right some individual wrong? Is it to take part
with the weak and oppressed against the strong and the overbearing?
No, no, my friends, on no such noble mission as this
have they gone. No purpose of high emprise has made them
buckle on the sword and prime the pistol. A poor, lone female,
who, through years, has been beaten, tyrannized over, and abused,
has ventured out to seek what this constitution professes to secure
to every one—liberty. Barefoot and alone, she has gone forth;
<pb id="browne109" n="109"/>
and 'tis to bring her back to a vile and brutal slavery that these
men have sallied out, regardless of her sex, her destitution, and
her misery. They have set out either to recapture her or to
shoot her down in her tracks like a dog. And this is a system
which Christian men speak of as heaven-ordained! This
is a thing countenanced by freemen, whose highest national
boast is, that theirs is the land of liberty, equality, and
free-rights! These are the people who yearly send large sums to
Ireland; who pray for the liberation of Hungary; who wish to
transmit armed forces across the Atlantic to aid vassal States in
securing their liberty! These are they who talk so largely of
Cuba, expend so much sympathy upon the oppressed of other
lands, and predict the downfall of England for her oppressive
form of government! Oh, America! “first pluck the beam out
of thine own eye, then shalt thou see more clearly the mote
that is in thy brother's.”</p>
          <p>When I watched those armed men ride away, in such high
courage and eagerness for the hunt, I thought of Lindy, poor,
lone girl, fatigued, worn and jaded, suffering from thirst and
hunger; her feet torn and bruised with toil, biding away in
bogs and marshes, with an ear painfully acute to every sound.
I thought of this, and all the resentment I had ever felt toward
her faded away as a vapor.</p>
          <p>All that day the house was in a state of intense excitement.
The servants could not work with their usual assiduity. Indeed,
such was the excitement, even of the white family, that we
were not strictly required to labor.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane gave me some fancy-sewing to do for her. Taking
it with me to Aunt Polly's cabin, intending to talk with her
whilst time was allowed me, I was surprised and pleased to find
the old woman still asleep. “It will do her good,” I thought,
“she needs rest, poor creature! And that blow was given to
her on my account! How much I would rather have received
it myself.” I then examined her head, and was glad to find
no mark or bruise; so I hoped that with a good sleep she
would wake up quite well. I seated myself on an old stool,
<pb id="browne110" n="110"/>
near the door, which, notwithstanding the rawness of the day,
I was obliged to leave open to admit light. It was a cool,
windy morning, such as makes a woollen shawl necessary. My
young mistresses had betaken themselves to cashmere wrappers
and capes; but I still wore my thin and “seedy” calico. As I
sewed on, upon Miss Jane's embroidery, many <hi rend="italics">fancies</hi> came in troops through my brain, defiling like a band of ghosts through
each private gallery and hidden nook of memory, and even to
the very inmost compartment of secret thought! My mother,
with her sad, sorrow-stricken face, my old companions and
play-fellows in the long-gone years, all arose with vividness to my
eye! Where were they all? Where had they been during
the lapse of years? Of my mother I had never heard a word.
Was she dead? At that suggestion I started, and felt my
heart grow chill, as though an icy hand had clenched it; yet
why felt I so? Did I not know that the grave would be to her
as a bed of ease? What torture could await her beyond the
pass of the valley of shadows? She, who had been faithful
over a little, would certainly share in those blessed rewards
promised by Christ; yet it seemed to me that my heart yearned
to look upon her again in this life. I could not, without pain,
think of her as <hi rend="italics">one who had been.</hi> There was something selfish
in this, yet was it intensely human, and to feel otherwise I
should have had to be less loving, less filial in my nature.
“Oh, mother!” I said, “if ever we meet again, will it be a meeting
that shall know no separation? Mother, are you changed?
Have you, by the white man's coarse brutality, learned to forget
your absent child? Do not thoughts of her often come to
your lonely soul with the sighing of the midnight wind? Do
not the high and merciful stars, that nightly burn above you,
recall me to your heart? Does not the child-loved moon speak
to you of times when, as a little thing, I nestled close to your
bosom? Or, mother, have other ties grown around your heart?
Have other children supplanted your eldest-born? Do chirruping
lips and bright eyes claim all your thoughts? Or do you
toil alone, broken in soul and bent in body, beneath the
<pb id="browne111" n="111"/>
drudgery of human labor, without one soft voice to lull you to
repose? Oh, not this, not this, kind. Heaven! Let her forget
me, in her joy; give her but peace, and on me multiply
misfortunes, rain down evils, only spare, shield and protect <hi rend="italics">her.</hi>”
This tide of thought, as it rolled rapidly through my mind, sent
the hot tears, in gushes, from my eyes, As I bent my head to
wipe them away, without exactly seeing it, I became aware of
a blessed presence; and, lifting my moist eyes, I beheld young
master standing before me, with that calm, spiritual glance
which had so often charmed and soothed me.</p>
          <p>“What is the matter, Ann? Why are you weeping?” he
asked me in a gentle voice.</p>
          <p>“Nothing, young Master, only I was thinking of my mother.”</p>
          <p>“How long since you saw her?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, years, young Master; I have not seen her since my
childhood—not since Master bought me.”</p>
          <p>He heaved a deep sigh, but said nothing; those eyes, with a
soft, shadowed light, as though they were shining through
misty tears, were bent upon me.</p>
          <p>“Where is your mother now, Ann?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, young Master, I've never heard from her
since I came here.”</p>
          <p>Again he sighed, and now he passed his thin white hand
across his eyes, as if to dissipate the mist.</p>
          <p>“You think she was sold when you were, don't you?”</p>
          <p>“I expect she was. I'm almost sure she was, for I don't
think either my young Masters or Mistresses wished or
expected to retain the servants.”</p>
          <p>“I wish I could find out something about her for you; but,
at present, it is out of my power. You must do the best you
can. You are a good girl, Ann; I have noticed how patiently
you bear hard trouble. Do you pray?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, young Master, and that is all the pleasure I have.
What would be my situation without prayer? Thanks to God,
the slave has this privilege!”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Ann, and in God's eyes you are equal to a white person.
<pb id="browne112" n="112"/>
He makes no distinction; your soul is as precious and
dear to Him as is that of the fine lady clad in silk and gems.”</p>
          <p>I opened my eyes to gaze upon him, as he stood there,
with his beautiful face beaming with good feeling and love
for the humblest and lowest of God's creatures. This was
religion! This was the spirit which Christ commended. This
was the love which He daily preached and practiced.</p>
          <p>“But how is Aunt Polly? I heard that she was suffering
much.”</p>
          <p>“She is sleeping easily now,” I replied.</p>
          <p>“Well, then, don't disturb her. It is better that she should
sleep;” and he walked away, leaving me more peaceful and
happy than before. Blessed youth!—why have we not more
such among us! They would render the thongs and fetters of
slavery less galling.</p>
          <p>The day was unusually quiet; but the frostiness of the
atmosphere kept the ladies pretty close within doors; and Mr.
Peterkin had, contrary to the wishes of his family, and the
injunctions of his physician, gone out with the others upon the
search; besides, he had taken Nace and the other men with
him, and, as Aunt Polly was sick, Ginsy had been appointed
in her place to prepare dinner. After sewing very diligently
for some time, I wandered out through the poultry lot, lost in a
labyrinth of strange reflection. As I neared the path leading down
toward the spring, young master's favorite walk, I could not
resist the temptation to follow it to its delightful terminus,
where he was wont to linger all the sunny summer day, and
frequently passed many hours in the winter time<corr sic="?">.</corr> I was superstitious enough to think that some of his deep and rich
philanthropy had been caught, as by inspiration, from this
lovely natural retreat; for how could the child of such a low,
beastly parent, inherit a disposition so heavenly, and a soul so
spotless? He had been bred amid scenes of the most revolting
cruelty; had lived with people of the harshest and most
brutal dispositions; yet had he contracted from them no moral
stain. Were they not hideous to look upon, and was he not
<pb id="browne113" n="113"/>
lovely as a seraph? Were they not low and vulgar, and he
lofty and celestial-minded? Why and how was this? Ah,
did I not believe him to be one of God's blessed angels, lent
us for a brief season?</p>
          <p>The path was well-trodden, and wound and curved through
the woods, down to a clear, natural spring of water.
There had been made, by the order of young master, a turfetted
seat, overgrown by soft velvet moss, and here this youth
would sit for hours to ponder, and, perhaps, to weave golden
fancies which were destined to ripen into rich fruition in that land
beyond the shores of time. As I drew near the spring, I
imagined that a calm and holy influence was settling over me.
The spirit of the place had power upon me, and I yielded myself
to the spell. It was no disease of fancy, or dream of enchantment,
that thus possessed me; for there, half-reclining on
the mossy bench, I beheld young master, and, seated at his
feet, with her little, odd, wondering face uplifted to his, was
Amy; and, crawling along, playing with the moss, and looking
down into the mirror of the spring, peered the bright eyes of
little Ben. It was a scene of such beauty that I paused to
take a full view of it, before making my presence known.
Young master, with his pale, intellectual face, his classic head,
his sun-bright curls, and his earnest blue eyes, sat in a
half-lounging attitude, making no inappropriate picture of an angel
of light, whilst the two little black faces seemed emblems of
fallen, degraded humanity, listening to his pleading voice.</p>
          <p>“Wherever you go, or in whatever condition you may be,
Amy, never forget to pray to the good Lord.” As he said this,
he bent his eyes compassionately on her.</p>
          <p>“Oh, laws, Masser, how ken I pray! de good Lord wouldn't
hear me. I is too black and dirty.”</p>
          <p>“God does not care for that. You are as dear to Him as the
finest lady of the land.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, now, Masser, you doesn't tink me is equal to you, a
fine, nice, pretty white gemman—dress so fine.”</p>
          <p>“God cares not, my child, for clothes, or the color of the skin.
<pb id="browne114" n="114"/>
He values the heart alone; and if your heart is clear, it matters
not whether your face be black or your clothes mean.”</p>
          <p>“Laws, now, young Masser,” and the child laughed heartily
at the idea, “you doesn't 'spect a nigger's heart am clean. I
tells you 'tis black and dirty as dere faces.”</p>
          <p>“My poor child, I would that I had power to scatter the
gloomy mist that beclouds your mind, and let you see and know
that our dying Saviour embraced all your unfortunate race in
the merits of his divine atonement.”</p>
          <p>This speech was not comprehended by Amy. She sat
looking vacantly at him; marvelling all the while at his pretty
talk, yet never once believing that Jesus prized a negro's soul.
Young master's eyes were, as usual, elevated to the clear,
majestic heavens. Not a cloud floated in the still, serene expanse,
and the air was chill. One moment longer I waited, before
revealing myself. Stepping forward, I addressed young master
in an humble tone.</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann, what do you want?” This was not said in a
petulant voice, but with so much gentleness that it invited the
burdened heart to make its fearful disclosure.</p>
          <p>“Oh, young Master, I know that you will pardon me for what
I am going to ask. I cannot longer restrain myself. Tell me
what is to become of us? When shall we be sold? Into whose
hands shall I fall?”</p>
          <p>“Alas, poor Ann, I am as ignorant of father's intentions as
you are. I would that I could relieve your anxiety, but I am
as uneasy about it as you or any one can be. Oh, I am powerless
to do anything to better your unfortunate condition. I am
weak as the weakest of you.”</p>
          <p>“I know, young Master, that we have your kindest sympathy,
and this knowledge softens my trouble.”</p>
          <p>He did not reply, but sat with a perplexed expression,
looking on the ground.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, you has done gin young Masser some trouble.
What fur you do dat? We niggers aint no 'count any how,
<pb id="browne115" n="115"/>
and you hab no sort ob bisiness be troublin' young Masser 'bout
it,” said Amy.</p>
          <p>“Be still, Amy, let Ann speak her troubles freely. It will
relieve her mind. You may tell me of yours too.”</p>
          <p>Sitting down upon the sward, close to his feet, I relieved my
oppressed bosom by a copious flood of tears. Still he spoke not,
but sat silent, looking down. Amy was awed into stillness,
and even little Ben became calm and quiet as a lamb. No one
broke the spell. No one seemed anxious to do so. There are
some feelings for which silence is the best expression.</p>
          <p>At length he said mildly, “Now, my good friends, it might be
made the subject of ungenerous remarks, if you were to be seen
talking with me long. You had better return to the house.”</p>
          <p>As Amy and I, with little Ben, rose to depart, he looked after
us, and sighing, exclaimed, “poor creatures, my heart bleeds
for you!”</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE PRATTLINGS OF INSANITY—OLD WOUNDS REOPEN—THE
WALK TO THE DOCTOR'S—INFLUENCE OF NATURE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>UPON my return to the house I hastened on to the cabin,
hoping to find Aunt Polly almost entirely recovered. Passing
hastily through the yard I entered the cabin with a light step,
and to my surprise found her sitting up in a chair, playing with
some old faded artificial flowers, the dilapidated decorations of
Miss Tildy's summer bonnet, which had been swept from the
house with the litter on the day before. I had never seen her
engaged in a pastime so childish and sportive, and was not a
little astonished, for her aversion to flowers had often been to
me the subject of remark.</p>
          <p>“What have you there that is pretty, Aunt Polly?” I asked
with tenderness.</p>
          <p>With a wondering, childish smile, she held the crushed blossoms
up, and turning them over and over in her hands, said:</p>
          <p>“Putty things! ye is berry putty!” then pressing them to
her bosom, she stroked the leaves as kindly as though she had
been smoothing the truant locks of a well-beloved child. I could
not understand this freak, for she was one to whose uncultured
soul all sweet and pretty fancies seemed alien. Looking up to
me with that vacant glance which at once explained all, she
said:</p>
          <p>“Who's dar? Who is you? Oh, dat is my darter,” and addressing
me by the remembered name of her own long-lost child,
she traversed, in thought, the whole waste-field of memory. Not
a single wild-flower in the wayside of the heart was neglected or
forgotten. She spoke of times when she had toyed and dandled
<pb id="browne117" n="117"/>
her infant darling upon her knee; then, shudderingly, she would
wave me off, with terror written all over her furrowed face, and
cry, “Get you away, Masser is comin': thar, thar he is; see
him wid de ropes; he is comin' to tar you 'way frum me. Here,
here child, git under de bed, hide frum 'em, dey is all gwine to
take you 'way—'way down de river, whar you'll never more see
yer poor old mammy.” Then sinking upon her knees, with her
hands outstretched, and her eyes eagerly strained forward, and
bent on vacancy, she frantically cried:</p>
          <p>“Masser, please, please Masser, don't take my poor chile from
me. It's all I is got on dis ar' airth; Masser, jist let me hab it
and I'll work fur you, I'll sarve you all de days ob my life.
You may beat my ole back as much as you please; you may
make me work all de day and all de night, jist, so I ken keep
my chile. Oh, God, oh, God! see, dere dey goes, wid my poor
chile screaming and crying for its mammy! See, see it holds
its arms to me! Oh, dat big hard man struck it sich a blow.
Now, now dey is out ob sight.” And crawling on her knees,
with arms outspread, she seemed to be following some imaginary
object, until, reaching the door, I feared in her transport
of agony she would do herself some injury, and, catching her
strongly in my arms, I attempted to hold her back; but she was
endowed with a superhuman strength, and pushed me violently
against the wall.</p>
          <p>“Thar, you wretch, you miserble wretch, dat would keep
me from my chile, take dat blow, and I wish it would send yer
to yer grave.”</p>
          <p>Recoiling a few steps, I looked at her. A wild and lurid
light gathered in her eye, and a fiendish expression played
over her face. She clenched her hands, and pressed her old
broken teeth hard upon her lips, until the blood gushed from
them; frothing at the mouth, and wild with excitement, she
made an attempt to bound forward and fell upon the floor. I
screamed for help, and sprang to lift her up. Blood oozed from
her mouth and nose; her eyes rolled languidly, and her
under-jaw fell as though it were broken.</p>
          <pb id="browne118" n="118"/>
          <p>In terror I bore her to the bed, and, laying her down, I went
to get a bowl of water to wash the blood and foam from her
face. Meeting Amy at the door, I told her Aunt Polly was
very sick, and requested her to remain there until my
return.</p>
          <p>I fled to the kitchen, and seizing a pan of water that stood
upon the shelf, returned to the cabin. There I found young
master bending over Aunt Polly, and wiping the blood-stains
from her mouth and nose with his own handkerchief. This was,
indeed, the ministration of the high to the lowly. This generous
boy never remembered the distinctions of color, but with
that true spirit of human brotherhood which Christ inculcated
by many memorable examples, he ministered to the humble,
the lowly, and the despised. Indeed, such seemed to take a
firmer hold upon his heart. Here, in this lowly cabin, like the
good Samaritan of old, he paused to bind up the wounds of a
poor outcast upon the dreary wayside of existence.</p>
          <p>Bending tenderly over Aunt Polly, until his luxuriant golden
curls swept her withered face, he pressed his linen handkerchief
to her mouth and nose to staunch the rapid flow of blood.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, have you come with the water? I fear she is
almost gone; throw it in her face with a slight force, it may revive
her,” he said in a calm tone.</p>
          <p>I obeyed, but there was no sign of consciousness. After one
or two repetitions she moved a little, young master drew a
bottle of <foreign lang="lat">sal volatile</foreign> from his pocket, and applied it to her nose.
The effect was sudden; she started up spasmodically, and looking
round the room laughed wildly, frightfully; then, shaking
her head, her face resumed its look of pitiful imbecility.</p>
          <p>“The light is quenched, and forever,” said young master,
and the tears came to his eyes and rolled slowly down his
cheeks. Amy, with Ben in her arms, stood by in anxious
wonder; creeping up to young master's side, she looked earnestly
in his face, saying—</p>
          <p>“Don't cry, Masser, Aunt Polly will soon be well; she jist
sick for little while. De lick Masser gib her only hurt her
<pb id="browne119" n="119"/>
little time,—she 'most well now, but her does look mighty
wild.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord, how much longer must these poor people be tried
in the furnace of affliction? How much longer wilt thou permit
a suffering race to endure this harsh warfare? Oh, Divine
Father, look pityingly down on this thy humble servant, who
is so sorely tried.” The latter part of the speech was uttered
as he sank upon his knees; and down there upon the coarse
puncheon floor we all knelt, young master forming the central
figure of the group, whilst little Amy, the baby-boy Ben, and
the poor lunatic, as if in mimicry, joined us. We surrounded
him, and surely that beautiful heart-prayer must have reached
the ear of God. When such purity asks for grace and mercy
upon the poor and unfortunate, the ear of Divine grace listens.</p>
          <p>“What fur you pray?” asked the poor lunatic.</p>
          <p>“I ask mercy for sore souls like thine.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, dat is funny; but say, sir, whar is my chile? Whar is
she? Why don't she come to me? She war here a minnit
ago; but now she does be gone away.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, what a mystery is the human frame! Lyre of the
spirit, how soon is thy music jarred into discord.” Young
master uttered this rhapsody in a manner scarcely audible, but
to my ear no sound of his was lost, not a word, syllable, or
tone!</p>
          <p>“Poor Luce—is dat Luce?” and the poor, crazed creature
stared at me with a bewildered gaze! “and my baby-boy, whar
is he, and my oldest sons? Dey is all gone from me and for
ever.” She began to weep piteously.</p>
          <p>“Watch with her kindly till I send Jake for the doctor,” he
said to me; then rallying himself, he added, “but they are all
gone—gone upon that accursed hunt;” and, seating himself in
a chair, he pressed his fingers hard upon his closed eye-lids.
“Stay, I will go myself for the doctor—she must not be
neglected.”</p>
          <p>And rising from his chair he buttoned his coat, and, charging
me to take good care of her, was about starting, but
<pb id="browne120" n="120"/>
Aunt Polly sprang forward and caught him by the arms,
exclaiming,</p>
          <p>“Oh, putty, far angel, don't leab me. I kan't let you leab
me—stay here. I has no peace when you is gone. Dey will
come and beat me agin, and dey will take my chil'en frum me.
Oh, please now, you stay wid me.”</p>
          <p>And she held on to him with such a pitiful fondness, and there
was so much anxiety in her face, such an infantile look of
tenderness, with the hopeless vacancy of idiocy in the eye, that to
refuse her would have been harsh; and of this young master
was incapable. So, turning to me, he said,</p>
          <p>“You go, Ann, for the doctor, and I will stay with her—poor
old creature I have never done anything for her, and now I will
gratify her.”</p>
          <p>As the horses had all been taken by the pursuers of Lindy, I
was forced to walk to Dr. Mandy's farm, which was about two
miles distant from Mr. Peterkin's. I was glad of this, for of
late it was indeed but seldom that I had been allowed to indulge
in a walk through the woods. All through the leafy glory of
the summer season I had looked toward the old sequestered
forest with a longing eye. Each little bird seemed wooing
me away, yet my occupations confined me closely to the house;
and a pleasure-walk, even on Sunday, was a luxury which a
negro might dream of but never indulge. Now, though it was
the lonely autumn time, yet loved I still the woods, dismantled
as they were. There is something in the grandeur of the venerable
forests, that always lifts the soul to devotion! The patriarchal
trees and the delicate sward, the wind-music and the
almost ceaseless miserere of the grove, elevate the heart, and to
the cultivated mind speak with a power to which that of books
is but poor and tame.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>QUIETUDE OF THE WOODS—A GLIMPSE OF 
THE STRANGER—MRS. MANDY'S WORDS OF CRUEL IRONY—SAD 
REFLECTIONS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE freshening breeze, tempered with the keen chill of the
coming winter, made a lively music through the woods, as, floating
along, it toyed with the fallen leaves that lay dried and sere
upon the earth. There stood the giant trees, rearing their bald
and lofty heads to the heavens, whilst at their feet was spread
their splendid summer livery. Like the philosophers of old, in
their calm serenity they looked away from earth and its troubles
to the “bright above.”</p>
          <p>I wandered on, with a quick step, in the direction of the
doctor's. The recent painful events were not calculated to color
my thoughts very pleasingly; yet I had taught myself to live
so entirely <hi rend="italics">within</hi>, to be so little affected by what was <hi rend="itlaics">without</hi>,
that I could be happy in imagination, notwithstanding what was
going on in the external world. 'Tis well that the negro is of
an imaginative cast. Suppose he were by nature strongly practical
and matter-of-fact; life could not endure with him. His
dreaminess, his fancy, makes him happy in spite of the dreary
reality which surrounds him. The poor slave, with not a six-pence
in his pocket, dreams of the time when he shall be able
to buy himself, and revels in this most delightful Utopia.</p>
          <p>I had walked on for some distance, without meeting any object
of special interest, when, passing through a large “<hi rend="italics">deadening,</hi>”
I was surprised to see a gentleman seated upon a fragment of
what had once been a noble tree. He was engaged at that
occupation which is commonly considered to denote want of
thought, viz., <hi rend="italics">whittling a stick.</hi></p>
          <pb id="browne122" n="122"/>
          <p>I stopped suddenly, and looked at him very eagerly, for now,
with the broad day-light streaming over him, I recognized the one
whom I had watched in the dubious moonbeams! This was Mr.
Robert Worth, the man who held those dangerous Abolition
principles—the fanatic, who was rash enough to express, south of
Mason and Dixon's line, the opinion that negroes are human
beings and entitled to consideration. Here now he was, and I
could look at him. How I longed to speak to him, to talk with
him, hear him tell all his generous views; to ask questions as to
those free Africans at the North who had achieved name and
fame, and learn more of the distinguished orator, Frederick
Douglass! So great was my desire, that I was almost ready
to break through restraint, and, forgetful of my own position,
fling myself at his feet, and beg him to comfort me. Then came
the memory of Miss Bradly's treachery, and I sheathed my
heart. “No, no, I will not again trust to white people. They
have no sympathy with us, our natures are too simple for their
cunning;” and, reflecting thus, I walked on, yet I felt as if I could
not pass him. He had spoken so nobly in behalf of the slave,
had uttered such lofty sentiments, that my whole soul bowed
down to him in worship. I longed to pay homage to him.
There is a principle in the slave's nature to reverence, to look
upward; hence, he makes the most devout Christian, and were
it not for this same spirit, he would be but a poor servant.</p>
          <p>So it was with difficulty I could let pass this opportunity of
speaking with one whom I held in such veneration, but I governed
myself and went on. All the distance I was pondering
upon what I had heard in relation to those of my brethren who
had found an asylum in the North. Oh, once there, I could
achieve so much! I felt, within myself, a latent power, that,
under more fortunate circumstances, might be turned to advantage.
When I reached Doctor Mandy's residence I found that
he had gone out to visit a patient. His wife came out to see
me, and asked,</p>
          <p>“Who is sick at Mr. Peterkin's?”</p>
          <p>I told her, “Aunt Polly, the cook.”</p>
          <pb id="browne123" n="123"/>
          <p>“Is much the matter?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Madam; young master thinks she has lost her 
reason.”</p>
          <p>“Lost her reason!” exclaimed Mrs. Mandy.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Madam; she doesn't seem to know any of us, and
evidently wanders in her thoughts.” I could not repress the
evidence of emotion when I remembered how kind to me the
old creature had been, nay, that for me she had received the
blow which had deprived her of reason.</p>
          <p>“Poor girl, don't cry,” said Mrs. Mandy. This lady was of
a warm, good heart, and was naturally touched at the sight of
human suffering; she was one of that quiet sort of beings who
feel a great deal and say but little. Fearful of giving offence,
she usually kept silence, lest the open expression of her sympathy
should defeat the purpose. A weak, though a good person,
she now felt annoyed because she had been beguiled into
even pity for a servant. She did not believe in slavery, yet
she dared not speak against the “peculiar institution” of the
South. It would injure the doctor's practice, a matter about
which she must be careful.</p>
          <p>I knew my place too well to say much; therefore I observed
a respectful silence.</p>
          <p>“Now, Ann, you had better hurry home. I expect there is
great excitement at your house, and the ladies will need your
services to-day, particularly; to remain out too long might
excite suspicion, and be of no service to you.”</p>
          <p>My looks plainly showed how entire was my acquiescence.
She must have known this, and then, as if self-interest
suggested it, she said,</p>
          <p>“You have a good home, Ann, I hope you will never do as
Lindy has done. Homes like yours are rare, and should be
appreciated. Where will you ever again find such kind 
mistresses and such a good master?”</p>
          <p>“Homes such as mine are rare!” I would that they were;
but, alas! they are too common, as many farms in Kentucky can
show! Oh, what a terrible institution this one must be, which
<pb id="browne124" n="124"/>
originates and involves so many crimes! Now, here was a
kind, honest-hearted woman, who felt assured of the criminality
of slavery; yet, as it is recognized and approved by law, she
could not, save at the risk of social position, pecuniary loss and
private inconvenience, even express an opinion against it. I
was the oppressed slave of one of her wealthy neighbors; she
dared not offer me even a word of pity, but needs must outrage
all my nature by telling me that I had a “good home, kind
mistresses and a good master!” Oh, bitter mockery of torn and
lacerated feelings! My blood curdled as I listened. How
much I longed to fling aside the servility at which my whole
soul revolted, and tell her, with a proud voice, how poorly I
thought she supported the dignity of a true womanhood, when
thus, for the poor reward of gold, she could smile at, and even
encourage, a system which is at war with the best interest of
human nature; which aims a deadly blow at the very machinery
of society; aye, attacks the noble and venerable institution of
marriage, and breaks asunder ties which God has commanded
us to reverence! This is the policy of that institution, which
Southern people swear they will support even with their life-blood!
I have ransacked my brain to find out a clue to the
wondrous infatuation. I have known, during the, years of my
servitude, men who had invested more than half of their wealth
in slaves; and he is generally accounted the greatest gentleman,
who owns the most negroes. Now, there is a reason for
the Louisiana or Mississippi planter's investing largely in this
sort of property; but why the Kentucky farmer should wish
to own slaves, is a mystery: surely it cannot be for the petty
ambition of holding human beings in bondage, lording it over
immortal souls! Oh, perverse and strange human nature!
Thoughts like these, with a lightning-like power, drove through
my brain and influenced my mind against Mrs. Mandy, who,
I doubt not, was, at heart, a kind, well-meaning woman. How
can the slave be a philanthropist?</p>
          <p>Without saying anything whereby my safety could be
imperilled, I left Mrs. Mandy's residence. When I had walked
<pb id="browne125" n="125"/>
about a hundred yards from the house, I turned and looked back,
and was surprised to see her looking after me. “Oh, white
woman,” I inwardly exclaimed, nursed in luxury, reared in
the lap of bounty, with friends, home and kindred, that mortal
power cannot tear you from, how can <hi rend="italics">you</hi> pity the poor, oppressed
slave, who has no liberty, no right, no father, no brother,
or friend, only as the white man chooses he shall have!“ Who
could expect these children of wealth, fostered by prosperity,
and protected by the law, to feel for the ignorant negro, who
through ages and generations has been crushed and kept in
ignorance? We are told to love our masters! Why should
we? Are we dogs to lick the hand that strikes us? Or are
we men and women with never-dying souls—men and women
unprotected in the very land they have toiled to beautify and
adorn! Oh, little, little do ye know, my proud, free brothers
and sisters in the North, of all the misery we endure, or of
the throes of soul that we have! The humblest of us feel that
we are deprived of something that we are entitled to by the
law of God and nature.</p>
          <p>I rambled on through the woods, wrapped in the shadows of
gloom and misanthropy. “Why,” I asked myself, “can't I be a hog
or dog to come at the call of my owner? Would it not be better
for me if I could repress all the lofty emotions and generous
impulses of my soul, and become a spiritless thing? I would swap
natures with the lowest insect, the basest serpent that crawls upon
the earth. Oh, that I could quench this thirsty spirit, satisfy
this hungry heart, that craveth so madly the food and drink of
knowledge! Is it right to conquer the spirit, which God has
given us? Is it best for a high-souled being to sit supinely
down and bear the vile trammels of an unnatural and immoral
bondage? Are these aspirings sent us from above? Are they
wings lent the spirit from angel? Or must they be clipped
and crushed as belonging to the evil spirit?” As I walked on,
in this state of mind, I neared the spot where I had beheld the
interesting stranger.</p>
          <p>To my surprise and joy I found him still there, occupied as
<pb id="browne126" n="126"/>
before, in whittling, perhaps the same stick. You, my free
friends, who from the fortunate accident of birth, are entitled
to the heritage of liberty, can but poorly understand how very
humble and degraded American slavery makes the victim.
Now, though I knew this man possessed the very information
for which I so longed, I dared not presume to address him on a
subject even of such vital import. I dare say, and indeed after-times
proved, this young apostle of reform would have applauded 
as heroism what then seemed to me as audacity.</p>
          <p>With many a lingering look toward him, I pursued the 
“noiseless tenor of my way.”</p>

            <p>A REFLECTION—AMERICAN ABOLITIONISTS—DISAFFECTION
IN KENTUCKY—THE YOUNG MASTER—HIS REMONSTRANCE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>UPON my arrival home I found that the doctor, lured by
curiosity, and not by business, had called. The news of Lindy's
flight had reached him in many garbled and exaggerated forms;
so he had come to assure himself of the truth. Of course, with
all a Southern patriot's ire, he pronounced Lindy's conduct an
atrocious crime, for which she should answer with life, or that
far worse penalty (as some thought), banishment “down the 
river.” Thought I not strangely, severely, of those persons,
the doctor and the ladies, as they sat there, luxuriating over a
bottle of wine, denouncing vengeance against a poor, forlorn
girl, who was trying to achieve her liberty;—heroically
contending for that on which Americans pride themselves? Had
she been a Hungarian or an Irish maid, seeking asylum from
the tyranny of a King, she would have been applauded as one
whose name was worthy to be enrolled in the litany of heroes;
but she was a poor, ignorant African, with a sooty face, and because
of this all sympathy was denied her, and she was pronounced
nothing but a “runaway negro,” who deserved a terrible punishment;
and the hand outstretched to relieve her, would have
been called guilty of treason. Oh, wise and boastful Americans,
see ye no oppression in all this, or do ye exult in that odious spot,
which will blacken the fairest page of your history “to the last
syllable of recorded time”? Does not a blush stain your cheeks
when you make vaunting speeches about the character of your
government? Ye cannot, I know ye cannot, be easy in your
consciences; I know that a secret, unspoken trouble gnaws like
<pb id="browne128" n="128"/>
a canker in your breasts! Many of you veil your eyes, and
grope through the darkness of this domestic oppression; you
will not listen to the cries of the helpless, but sit supinely down
and argue upon the “right” of the thing. There were kind and
tender-hearted Jews, who felt that the crucifixion of the Messiah
was a fearful crime, yet fear sealed their lips. And are
there not now time-serving men, who are worthy and capable
of better things, but from motives of policy will offer no word
against this barbarous system of slavery? Oh, show me the
men, like that little handful at the North, who are willing to
forfeit everything for the maintenance of human justice and
mercy. Blessed apostles, near to the mount of God! your lips
have been touched with the flame of a new Pentecost, and ye
speak as never men spake before! Who that listens to the
words of Parker, Sumner, and Seward, can believe them other
than inspired? Theirs is no ordinary gift of speech; it burns
and blazes with a mighty power! Cold must be the ear that
hears them unmoved; and hard the heart that throbs not in
unison with their noble and earnest expressions! Often have I
paused in this little book, to render a feeble tribute to these great
reformers. It may be thought out of place, yet I cannot repress
the desire to speak my voluntary gratitude, and, in the name
of all my scattered race, thank them for the noble efforts they
have made in our behalf!</p>
          <p>All the <sic corr="malignity">malgnity</sic> of my nature was aroused against Miss
Bradly, when I heard her voice loudest in denunciation against
Lindy.</p>
          <p>As I was passing through the room, I could catch fragments
of conversation anything but pleasing to the ear of a slave;
but I had to listen in meekness, letting not even a working
muscle betray my dissent. They were orthodox, and would not
tolerate even from an equal a word contrary to their views.</p>
          <p>I did not venture to ask the doctor what he thought of Aunt
Polly, for that would have been called impudent familiarity,
punishable with <sic corr="whipping">wiphping</sic> at the “post;” but when I met young
master in the entry, I learned from him that the case was one
<pb id="browne129" n="129"/>
of hopeless insanity. Blood-letting, &amp;c., had been resorted to,
but with no effect. The doctor gave it as his opinion that the
case was “without remedy.” Not knowing that young master
differed from his father and sisters, the doctor had, in his jocose
and unfeeling way, suggested that it was not much difference;
the old thing was of but little value; she was old and worn-out.
To all this young master made no other reply than a fixed look
from his meek eyes—a look which the doctor could not
understand; for the idea of sympathy with or pity for a slave would
have struck him as being a thing existing only in the bosom of
a fanatical abolitionist, whose conviction would not permit him
to cross the line of Mason and Dixon. Ah! little knew he (the
coarse doctor) what a large heart full of human charities had
grown within; nay, was indigenous to this south-western latitude.
I believe, yes have reason to know, that the pure sentiment
of abolition is one that is near and dear to the heart of
many a Kentuckian; even those who are themselves the hereditary
holders of slaves are, in many instances, the most opposed
to the system. This sentiment is, perhaps, more largely developed
in, and more openly expressed by, the females of the
State; and this is accounted for from the fact that to be
suspected of abolition tendencies is at once the plague-mark
whereby a man is ever after considered unfit for public
trust or political honor. It is the great question, the strong
conservative element of society. To some extent it likewise
taboos, in social circles, the woman who openly expresses such
sentiments; though as she has no popular interests to stake, in
many cases her voice will be on the side of right, not might.</p>
          <p>In later years I remember to have overheard a colloquy between
a lady and gentleman (both slaveholders) in Kentucky.
The gentleman had vast possessions, about one-third of which
consisted of slaves. The lady's entire wealth was in six negroes,
some of them under the age of ten. They were hired out at
the highest market prices, and by the proceeds she was supported.
She had been raised in a strongly conservative community;
nay, her own family were (to use a Kentuckyism) the
<pb id="browne130" n="130"/>
“pick and choose” of the pro-slavery party. Some of them
had been considered the able vindicators of the “system;” yet
she, despite the force of education and the influence of domestic
training, had broken away from old trammels and leash-strings,
and was, both in thought and expression, a bold, ingrain abolitionist.
She defied the lions in their chosen dens. On the occasion
of this conversation, I heard her say that she could not
remain happy whilst she detained in bondage those creatures
who could claim, under the Constitution, alike with her, their
freedom; and so soon as she attained her majority, she intended
to liberate them. “But,” said she—and I shall never forget
the mournful look of her dark eye—the statute of the State
will not allow them to remain here ten days after liberation;
and one of these men has a wife (to whom he is much attached),
who is a slave to a master that will neither free her nor sell her.
Now, this poor captive husband would rather remain in slavery
to me, than be parted from his wife; and here is the point upon
which I always stand. I wish to be humane and just to him;
and yet rid myself from the horrid crime to which, from the
accident of inheritance, I have become accessory.” The
gentleman, who seemed touched by the heroism of the girl, was
beguiled into a candid acknowledgment of his own sentiments;
and freely declared to her that, if it were not for his political
aspirations, he would openly free every slave he owned, and
relieve his conscience from the weight of the “perilous stuff” that
so oppressed it. “But,” said he, “were I to do it in Kentucky,
I should be politically dead. It would, besides, strike a blow
at my legal practice, and then what could I do? ‘Othello's
occupation would be gone.’ Of what avail, then, would be my
‘quiddits, quillets; my cages, tenures and my tricks?’ I, who
am high in political favor, should live to read my shame. I,
who now ‘tower in my pride of place, should, by some mousing
owl, be hawked at and killed!’ No, I must burden my conscience
yet a little longer.”</p>
          <p>The lady, with all a young girl's naïve and beautiful enthusiasm,
besought him to disregard popular praise and worldly
<pb id="browne131" n="131"/>
distinction. “Seek first,” said she, “the kingdom of heaven,
and all things else shall be given you;” but the gentleman had
grown hard in this world's devious wiles. He preferred throwing
off his allegiance to Providence, and, single-handed and
alone, making his fate. Talk to me of your thrifty men, your
popular characters, and I instantly know that you mean a
cringing, parasitical server of the populace; one who sinks
soul, spirit and manly independence for the mere garments that
cover his perishable body, and to whom the empty plaudits
of the unthinking crowd are better music than the thankful
prayer of suffering humanity. Let such an one, I say, have his
full measure of the “clapping of hands,” let him hear it all the
while; for he cannot see the frown that darkens the brow of
the guardian angel, who, with a sigh, records his guilt. Go on,
thou worldly Pharisee, but the day <hi rend="italics">will come</hi>, when the lowly
shall be exalted. Trust and wait we longer. Oh, ye who
“know the right, and yet the wrong pursue,” a fearful reckoning
will be yours.</p>
          <p>But young master was not of this sort; I felt that his lips
were closed from other and higher motives. If it had been of
any avail, no matter what the cost to himself, he would have
spoken. His soul knew but one sentiment, and that was “love
to God and good will to men on earth.” And now, as he entered
the room where the doctor and the ladies were seated,
and listened to their heartless conversation, he planted himself
firmly in their midst, saying:</p>
          <p>“Sisters, the time has come when I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> speak. Patiently
have I lived beneath this my father's roof, and witnessed,
without uttering one word, scenes at which my whole soul revolted;
I have heard that which has driven me from your side. On my
bare knees, in the gloom of the forest, I have besought God to
soften your hearts. I have asked that the dew of mercy might
descend upon the hoary head of my father, and that womanly
gentleness might visit your obdurate hearts. I have felt that I
could give my life up a sacrifice to obtain this; but my unworthy
prayers have not yet been answered. In vain, in vain,
<pb id="browne132" n="132"/>
I have hoped to see a change in you. Are you women or
fiends? How can you persecute, to the death, poor, ignorant
creatures, whose only fault is a black skin? How can you
inhumanly beat those who have no protectors but you? Reverse
the case, and take upon yourselves their condition; how would
you act? Could you bear silently the constant “wear and
tear” of body, the perpetual imprisonment of the soul? Could
you surrender yourselves entirely to the keeping of another,
and that other your primal foe—one who for ages has had his
arm uplifted against your race? Suppose you every day
witnessed a board groaning with luxuries (the result of your
labor) devoured by your persecutors, whilst you barely got the
crumbs; your owners dressed in purple and fine linen, whilst
you wore the coarsest material, though all their luxury was the
product of your exertion; what think you would be right for
you to do? Or suppose I, whilst lingering at the little spring,
should be stolen off, gagged and taken to Algiers, kept there in
servitude, compelled to the most drudging labor; poorly clad
and scantily fed whilst my master lived like a prince; kept in
constant terror of the lash; punished severely for every venial
offence, and my poor heart more lacerated than my body;—
what would you think of me, if a man were to tell me that,
with his assistance, I could make my escape to a land of liberty,
where my rights would be recognized, and my person safe from
violence; I say what would you think, if I were to decline,
and to say I preferred to remain with the Algerines? He
paused, but none replied. With eyes wonderingly fixed upon
him, the group remained silent.</p>
          <p>“You are silent all,” he continued, “for conviction, like a
swift arrow, has struck your souls. Oh, God!” and he raised
his eyes upward, “out of the mouths of babes and sucklings let
wisdom, holiness and truth proceed. Touch their flinty hearts,
and let the spark of grace be! Oh, sisters, know ye
not that this Algerine captivity that I have painted, is but a
poor picture of the daily martyrdom which our slaves endure?
Look on that old woman, who, by a brutal blow from our father,
<pb id="browne133" n="133"/>
has been deprived of her reason. Look at that little haggard
orphan, Amy, who is the kicked football of you all. Look at
the poor men whom we have brutalized and degraded. Think
of Lindy, driven by frenzy to brave the passage to an unknown
country rather than longer endure what we have put upon her.
Gaze, till your eyes are bleared, upon that whipping-post, which
rises upon our plantation; it is wet, even now, with the blood
that has gushed from innocent flesh. Look at the ill-fed, ill-clothed
creatures that live among us; and think they have immortal
souls, which we have tried to put out. Oh, ponder well
upon these things, and let this poor, wretched girl, who has
sallied forth, let her go, I say, to whatever land she wishes, and
strive to forget the horrors that haunted her here.”</p>
          <p>Again he paused, but none of them durst reply. Inspired by
their silence, he went on:</p>
          <p>“And from you, Miss Bradly, I had expected better
things. You were reared in a State where the brutality of the
slave system is not tolerated. Your early education, your
home influences, were all against it. Why and how can your
womanly heart turn away from its true instincts? Is it for you,
a Northerner and a woman, to put up your voice in defence of
slavery? Oh, shame! triple-dyed shame, should stain your
cheeks! Well may my sisters argue for slavery, when you,
their teacher, aid and abet them. Could you not have instilled
better things into their minds? I know full well that your
heart and mind are against slavery; but for the ease of living
in our midst, enjoying our bounty, and receiving our money,
you will silence your soul and forfeit your principles. Yea, for
a salary, you will pander to this horrid crime. Judas, for thirty
pieces of silver, sold the Redeemer of the world; but what
remorse followed the dastard act! You will yet live to curse the
hour of your infamy. You might have done good. Upon the
waxen minds of these girls you might have written noble things,
but you would not.”</p>
          <p>I watched Miss Bradly closely whilst he was speaking.
She turned white as a sheet. Her countenance bespoke the
<pb id="browne134" n="134"/>
convicted woman. Not an eye rested upon her but read the
truth. Starting up at length from her chair, Miss Jane shouted
out, in a theatrical way,</p>
          <p>“Treason! treason in our own household, and from one of
our own number! And so, Mr. John, you are the abolitionist
that has sown dissension and discontent among our domestics.
We have thought you simple; but I discover, sir, you are
more knave than fool. Father shall know of this, and take
steps to arrest this treason.”</p>
          <p>“As you please, sister Jane; you can make what report you
please, only speak the truth<corr>.</corr>”</p>
          <p>At this she flew toward him, and, catching him by the collar,
slapped his cheeks severely.</p>
          <p>“Right well done,” said a clear, manly voice; and, looking
up, I saw Mr. Worth standing in the open door. “I have been
knocking,” said he, “for full five minutes; but I am not surprised
that you did not hear me, for the strong speech to which
I have listened had force enough to overpower the sound of a
thunder-storm.”</p>
          <p>Miss Jane recoiled a few steps, and the deepest crimson
dyed her cheeks. She made great pretensions to refinement,
and could not bear, now, that a gentleman (even though an
abolitionist) should see her striking her brother. Miss Tildy
assumed the look of injured innocence, and smilingly invited
Mr. Worth to take a seat.</p>
          <p>“Do not be annoyed by what you have seen. Jane is not
passionate; but the boy was rude to her, and deserved a
reproof.”</p>
          <p>Without making a reply, but, with his eye fixed on young
master, Mr. Worth took the offered seat. Miss Bradly, with
her face buried in her hands, moved not; and the doctor sat
playing with his half-filled glass of wine; but young master
remained standing, his eye flashing strangely, and a bright
crimson spot glowing on either cheek. He seemed to take no note
of the entrance of Mr. Worth, or in fact any of the group.
There he stood, with his golden locks falling over his white
<pb id="browne135" n="135"/>
brow; and calm serenity resting like a sunbeam on his face.
Very majestic and imposing was that youthful presence. High
determination and everlasting truth were written upon his
face. With one look and a murmured “Father forgive them,
for they know not what they do,” he turned away.</p>
          <p>“Stop, stop, my brave boy,” cried Mr. Worth, “stop, and
let me look upon you. Had the South but one voice, and that
one yours, this country would soon be clear of its great
dishonor.”</p>
          <p>To this young master made no spoken reply; but the clear
smile that lit his countenance expressed his thanks; and seeing
that Mr. Worth was resolved to detain him, he said,</p>
          <p>“Let me go, good sir, for now I feel that I need the woods,”
and soon his figure was gliding along his well-beloved path, in
the direction of the spring. Who shall say that solitary communing
with Nature unfits the soul for active life? True, indeed,
it does unfit it for baseness, sordid dealings, and low detraction,
by lifting it from its low condition, and sending it out in a broad
excursiveness.</p>
          <p>Here, in the case of young master, was a sweet and
glowing flower that had blossomed in the wilds, and been
nursed by nature only. The country air had fanned into bloom
the bud of virtue and the beauty of highest truth.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE RETURN OF THE HUNTERS FLUSHED WITH SUCCESS—MR.
PETERKIN'S VAGARY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>As young Master strode away, Misses Jane and Tildy
regarded each other in silent wonder. At length the latter,
who caught the cue from her sister, burst forth in a violent
laugh, that I can define only by calling it a romping laugh,
so full of forced mirth. Miss Jane took up the echo, and the
house resounded with their assumed merriment. No one else,
however, seemed to take the infection; and they had the fun
all to themselves.</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann,” said Miss Tildy, putting on a quizzical air, “I
suppose you have been very much edified by your young
master's explosion of philanthropy and good-will toward you
darkies.”</p>
          <p>Too well I knew my position to make an answer; so there
I stood, silent and submissive.</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, I suppose this young renegade has delivered abolition
lectures in the kitchen hall, to his ‘dearly belubed’ brederen
ob de colored race,” added Miss Matilda, intending to be
vastly witty.</p>
          <p>“I think we had better send him on to an Anti-slavery
convention, and give him a seat 'twixt Lucy Stone and Fred
Douglas. Wouldn't his white complexion contrast well with
that of the sable orator?” and this Miss Jane designed should
be exceedingly pungent.</p>
          <p>Still no one answered, Mr. Worth's face wore a troubled
expression; the doctor still played with his wine-glass; and
Miss Bradly's face was buried deeper in her hands.</p>
          <pb id="browne137" n="137"/>
          <p>“Suppose father had been here; what do you think he
would have said?” asked Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>This, no doubt, recalled Dr. Mandy to the fact that Mr.
Peterkin's patronage was well worth retaining, so he must speak
now.</p>
          <p>“Oh, your father, Miss Jane, is such a sensible man, that he
would consider it only the freak of an imprudent beardless
boy.”</p>
          <p>“Is, then,” I asked myself, “all expressed humanity but
idle gibberish? Is it only beardless boys who can feel for
suffering slaves? Is all noble philanthropy voted vapid by
sober, serious, reflecting manhood? If so, farewell hope, and
welcome despair!” I looked at Mr. Worth; but his face was
rigid, and a snowy pallor overspread his gentle features. He
was young, and this was his first visit to Kentucky. In his
home at the North he had heard many stories of the manner
in which slavery was conducted in the West and South; but
the stories, softened by distance, had reached him in a mild
form, consequently he was unprepared for what he had
witnessed since his arrival in Kentucky. He had, though
desiring liberty alike for all, both white and black, looked upon the
system as an unjust and oppressive one, but he had no thought
that it existed in the atrocious and cruel form which fact, not
report, had now revealed to him. His whole soul shuddered
and shrivelled at what he saw. He marvelled how the skies
could be so blue and beautiful; how the flowers could spring
so lavishly, and the rivers roll so majestically, and the stars
burn so brightly over a land dyed with such horrible crimes.</p>
          <p>“Father will not deal very leniently with this boy's follies;
he will teach Johnny that there's more virtue in honoring a
father, than in equalizing himself with negroes.” Here Miss
Jane tossed her head defiantly.</p>
          <p>Just then a loud noise was heard from the avenue, and, looking
out the window, we descried the hunters returning crowned
with exultation, for, alas! poor Lindy had been found, and
there, handcuffed, she marched between a guard of Jake on
<pb id="browne138" n="138"/>
the one side, and Dan on the other. There were marks of
blood on her brow, and her dress was here and there stained.
Cool as was the day, great drops of perspiration rolled off her
face. With her head bowed low on her breast, she walked on
amid the ribald jests of her persecutors.</p>
          <p>“Well, we has cotch dis 'ere runaway gal, and de way we
did chase her down is nuffen to nobody,” said old Nace, who
had led the troop. I tells you it jist takes dis here nigger
and his hounds to tree the runaway. I reckons, Miss Lindy,
you'll not be fur trying ob it agin.”</p>
          <p>“No, dat hab fixed her,” replied the obsequious Jake. Dan
laughed heartily, showing his stout teeth.</p>
          <p>“Now, Masser,” said Nace, as taking off his remnant of a
hat he scraped his foot back, and grinned terribly, “dis ar'
nigger, if you pleases, sar, would like to hab a leetle drap ob
de critter dat you promise to him.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, you black rascal, you wants some ob my fust-rate
whiskey, does you? Wal, I 'spects, as you treed dat ar'
d—d nigger-wench, you desarves a drap or so.”</p>
          <p>“Why, yes, Masser, you see as how I did do my best for to
ketch her, and I is right much tired wid de run. You sees dese
old legs is gettin' right stiff; dese jints ain't limber like Jake
and Dan's dar, yet I tink, Masser, I did de bestest, an' I ought
to hab a leetle drap de most, please, sar.”</p>
          <p>“Come, 'long, come 'long, boys, arter we stores dis gal away
I'll gib you yer dram.”</p>
          <p>There had stood poor Lindy, never once looking up, crest-fallen,
broken in heart, and bruised in body, awaiting a painful
punishment, scarce hoping to escape with life and limb. Striking
her a blow with his huge riding-whip, Mr. Peterkin shouted,
“off with you to the lock-up!”</p>
          <p>Now, that which was technically termed the “lock-up,” was
an old, strong building, which had once been used as a
smoke-house, but since the erection of a new one, was employed
for the very noble purpose of confining negroes. It was
a dark, damp place, without a window, and but one low door,
<pb id="browne139" n="139"/>
through which to enter. In this wretched place, bound and
manacled, the poor fugitive was thrust.</p>
          <p>“There, you may run off if you ken,” said Mr. Peterkin, as
he drew the rough door to, and fastened on the padlock with
the dignified air of a regularly-installed jailer. “Now, boys,
come 'long and git the liquor.”</p>
          <p>This pleasing announcement seemed to give an additional
impetus to the spirits of the servants, and, with many a “ha, ha,
ha,” they followed their master.</p>
          <p>“Well, father,” said Miss Jane, whilst she stood beside Mr.
Peterkin, who was accurately measuring out a certain quantity
of whiskey to the three smiling slaves, who stood holding their
tin cups to receive it, “I am glad you succeeded in arresting
that audacious runaway. Where did you find her? Who
was with her? How did she behave? Oh, tell me all about
the adventure; it really does seem funny that such a thing
should have occurred in our family; and now that the wretch
has been caught, I can afford to laugh at it.”</p>
          <p>“Wal,” answered Mr. Peterkin, as he replaced the cork in
the brown jug, and proceeded to lock it up in his private
closet, “you does ax the most questions in one breath of any
gal I ever seed in all my life. Why, I haint bin in the house
five minutes, and you has put more questions to me than a
Philadelphy lawyer could answer. 'Pon my soul, Jane, you
is a fast 'un.”</p>
          <p>“Never mind my fastness, father, but tell me what I asked.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, whar is I to begin? You axed whar Lindy was
found? These dogs hunted her to Mr. Farland's barn. Thar
they 'gan to smell and snort round and cut up all sorts of
capers, and old Nace clumb up to the hay loft, and sung out,
in a loud voice, ‘Here she am, here she am!’ Then I hearn
a mighty scrambling and skufflin' up dar, so I jist springed up
arter Nace, and thar was the gal, actually fightin' with Nace,
who wanted to fetch her right down to the ground whar we
was a waitin'. I tells you, now, one right good lick from my
powder horn fetched her all right. She soon seen it was no
<pb id="browne140" n="140"/>
kind of use to be opposin' of us, and so she jist sot down right
willin'. I then fetched several good licks, and she knowed
how to do, kase, when I seed I had drawed the blood, I didn't
kere to beat her any more. So I ordered her to git down outen
that ar' loft quicker than she got up. Then we bound her
hands, and driv her long through the woods like a bull. I tells
you she was mighty-much 'umbled and shamed; every now and
thin she'd blubber out a cryin', but my whup soon shot up her
howlin'.”</p>
          <p>“I've a great notion to go,” said Jane, “and torment her a
little more, the impudent hussy! I wonder if she thinks we
will ever take her back to live with us. She has lost a good
home, for she shall not come here any more. I want you to
sell her, father, and at the highest price, to a regular
trader.”</p>
          <p>“That will I do, and there is a trader in this very neighborhood
now. I'll ride over this arternoon and make 'rangements
with him fur her sale. But come, Jane, I is powerful hungry;
can't you git me something to eat?”</p>
          <p>“But, father, I have a word to say with you in private, draw
near me.”</p>
          <p>“What ails you now, gals?” he said, as Miss Tildy joined
them, with a perplexed expression of countenance. As he
drew close to them I heard Miss Jane say, through her clenched
teeth, in a hissing tone:</p>
          <p>“Old Polly is insane; lost her reason from that blow which
you gave her. Do you think they could indict you?”</p>
          <p>“Who, in the name of h—l, can say that I struck her? Who
saw it? No, I'd like fur to see the white man that would dar
present Jeems Peterkin afore the Grand Jury, and a nigger
darn't think of sich a thing, kase as how thar testimony ain't
no count.”</p>
          <p>“Then we are safe,” both of the ladies simultaneously cried.</p>
          <p>“But whar is that d—d old hussy? She ain't crazy, only
'possuming so as to shuffle outen the work. Let me git to her
once, and I'll be bound she will step as smart as ever. One
<pb id="browne141" n="141"/>
shake of the old cowhide will make her jump and talk as
sensible as iver she did.”</p>
          <p>“ 'Tisn't worth while, father, going near her. I tell you,
Doctor Mandy says she is a confirmed lunatic.”</p>
          <p>“I tells yer I knows her constitution better 'an any of
yer, doctors, and all; and this here cowhide is allers the best
medicine fur niggers; they ain't like the white folks, no how nor
ways.”</p>
          <p>So saying he, followed by his daughters, went to the cabin
where poor Aunt Polly was sitting, in all the touching simplicity
of second childhood, playing with some bits of ribbon,
bright-colored calico, and flashy artificial flowers. Looking up
with a vacant stare at the group she spoke not, but, slowly
shaking her head in an imbecile way, murmured:</p>
          <p>“These are putty, but yer mustn't take 'em frum me; dese
am all dat dis ole nigger hab got, dese here am fadder, mudder,
hustbund, an chile. Lit me keep 'em.</p>
          <p>“You old fool, what's you 'bout, gwine on at this here rate?
Don't you know I is yer master, and will beat the very life
outen yer, if yer don't git up right at once?”</p>
          <p>“Now who is yer? Sure now, an' dis old nigger doesn't
know yer. Yer is a great big man, dat looks so cross and bad
at me. I wish yer would go on 'bout yer own bisness, and be
a lettin' me 'lone. I ain't a troublin' of yer, no way.”</p>
          <p>“You ain't, arnt yer, you old fool? but I'll give yer a drap of
medicine that'll take the craze outen yer, and make yer know
who yer master is. How does you like that, and this, and this?”
and, suiting the action to the word, he dealt her blow after blow,
in the most ferocious manner. Her shoulders were covered
with blood that gushed from the torn flesh. A low howl (it
could only be called a howl) burst from her throat, and flinging
up her withered hands, she cried, “Oh, good Lord Jesus,
come and help thy poor old servant, now in dis her sore time
ob trouble.”</p>
          <p>“The Lord Jesus won't hear sich old nigger wretches as you,”
said Mr. Peterkin.</p>
          <pb id="browne142" n="142"/>
          <p>“Oh, yes, de Lord Jesus will. He 'peared to me but a leetle
bit ago, and he was all dressed in white, wid a gold crown upon
His head, and His face war far and putty like young Masser's,
only it seemed to be heap brighter, and he smiled at dis poor
old sufferin' nigger; and den 'peared like a low, little voice 'way
down to de bottom ob my heart say, Polly, be ob good cheer,
de Lord Jesus is comin' to take you home. He no care weder
yer skin is white or black. He is gwine fur to make yer happy
in de next world. Oh, den me feel so good, me no more care
for anything.”</p>
          <p>“All of this is a crazy fancy,” said Dr. Mandy, who stepped
into the cabin; but taking hold of Polly's wrist, and holding his
fingers over her pulse, his countenance changed. “She has
excessive fever, and a strong flow of blood to the brain. She
cannot live long. Put her instantly to bed, and let me apply
leeches.”</p>
          <p>“Do yer charge extry for leeching, doctor?” asked Mr.
Peterkin.</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, Sir, but it is not much consideration, as you are one
of my best customers.”</p>
          <p>“I don't want to run any useless expense 'bout the old 'oman.
You see she has served my family a good many years.”</p>
          <p>“And you are for that reason much attached to her,”
interposed the doctor.</p>
          <p>“Not a bit of it, Sir. I never was 'tached to a nigger. Even
when I was a lad I had no fancy fur 'em, not even yer bright
yallow wenches; and I ain't gwine fur to spend money on that
old nigger, unless you cure her, and make her able to work and
pay fur the money that's bin laid out fur her.”</p>
          <p>“I can't promise to do that; neither am I certain that the
leeches will do her any material good, but they will assuredly
serve to mitigate her sufferings, by decreasing the fever, which
now rages so high.”</p>
          <p>“I don' care a cuss for that. Taint no use then of trying
the leeches. If she be gwine to die, why let her do it in the
cheapest way.”</p>
          <pb id="browne143" n="143"/>
          <p>Saying this, he went off with the young ladies, the doctor
following in the wake. As he was passing through the door-way,
I caught him by the skirts of his coat. Turning suddenly
round, he saw who it was, and drew within the cabin.</p>
          <p>“Doctor,” and I spoke with great timidity, “is she so ill?
Will she, must she die? Please try the leeches. Here,” and
I drew from an old hiding-place in the wall the blessed
half-dollar which Master Eddy had given me as a keepsake. For
years it had lain silently there, treasured more fondly than
Egyptian amulet or Orient gem. On some rare holiday I had
drawn it from its concealment to gloat over it with all a miser's
pride. I did not value it for the simple worth of the coin, for I
had sense enough to know that its actual value was but slight;
yet what a wealth of memories it called up! It brought <hi rend="italics">back</hi>
the times when <hi rend="italics">I had a mother</hi>; when, as a happy, careless
child (though a slave), I wandered through the wild greenwood;
where I ranged free as a bird, ere the burden of a blow had
been laid upon my shoulders; and when my young master
and mistress sometimes bestowed kind words upon me. The
fair locks and mild eyes of the latter gleamed upon me with
dream-like beauty. The kind, tearful face of Master Eddy, his
gentle words on that last most dreadful day that bounded and
closed the last chapter of happy childhood—all these things
were recalled by the sight of this simple little half-dollar! And
now I was going to part with it. What a struggle it was! I
couldn't do it. No, I couldn't do it. It was the one <hi rend="itlaics">silver</hi> link
between me and remembered joy. To part with it would be to
wipe out the <hi rend="italics">bright</hi> days of my life. It would be sacrilege,
injustice, a wrong; no, I replaced it in the old faded rag (in
which it had been wrapped for years), and closed my hand
convulsively over it. There stood the doctor! He had caught
sight of the gleaming coin, and (small as it was) his cupidity was
excited, and when he saw my hand closed over the shining
treasure, the smile fled from his face, and he said:</p>
          <p>“Girl, for what purpose did you detain me? My time is
<pb id="browne144" n="144"/>
precious. I have other patients to visit this morning, and
cannot be kept here longer!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, doctor, try the leeches.”</p>
          <p>“Your Master says he won't pay for them.”</p>
          <p>“But for the sake of charity, for the value of human life,
you will do it without pay.”</p>
          <p>“Will I, though? Trust me for that—and who will feed my
wife and children in the meantime. I can't be doctoring every
old sick nigger gratuitously. Her old fagged-out frame ain't
worth the waste of my leeches. I thought you were going to
pay for it; but you see a nigger is a nigger the world over.
They are too stingy to do anything for one of their own tribe.”</p>
          <p>“But this money is a keepsake, a parting-gift from my young
Master, who gave it to me years ago, when I was sold. I prize
it because of the recollections which it calls up.”</p>
          <p>“A sentimental nigger! Well, <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is something new; but
if you cared for that old woman's life you wouldn't hesitate,”
and, so saying, he walked away. I looked upon poor Aunt
Polly, and I fancied there was a rebuking light in her feeble
eye; and her withered hands seemed stretched out to ask the
help which I cruelly withheld.</p>
          <p>And shall I desert her who has suffered so deeply for me?
Well may she reproach me with that “piteous action”—me, who
for a romantic and fanciful feeling withhold the means of saving
her life. Oh, how I blamed myself! How wicked and selfish
I thought my heart.</p>
          <p>“Doctor! come back, doctor! here is the money,” I cried.
He had stood but a few steps without the cabin door,
doubtless expecting this change in my sentiments.</p>
          <p>“You have done well, Ann, to deny yourself, and make some
effort to save the life of the old woman. You see I would have
done it for nothing; but the leeches cost me money. It is
inconvenient to get them, and I have a family, a very helpless
one, to support, and you know it won't do to neglect them, lest
I be worse than a heathen and infidel. In your case, my good
girl, the case is quite different, for <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi> are taken care of and
<pb id="browne145" n="145"/>
supported by their Masters, and any little change that you may
have is an extra, for which you have no particular need.”</p>
          <p>An “extra” indeed it was, and a very rare one. One that
had come but once in my life, and, God be praised, it afforded
me an opportunity of doing the good Samaritan's work! I had
seen how the Levite and the priest had neglected the wounded
woman, and with this little coin I could do a noble deed; but
as to my being well-cared and provided for, I thought the doctor
had shot wide of his mark. I was surprised at the tone of easy
familiarity which he assumed toward me; but this was explained
by the fact that he was what is commonly called a jolly fellow,
and had been pretty freely indulging in the “joyful glass.”
Besides, I was going to pay him; then, maybe, he felt a little
ashamed of his avarice, and sought by familiar tone and manner
to beguile me, and satisfy his conscience.</p>
          <p>His “medical bags” had been left in the entry, for Miss Jane,
who delighted in the Lubin-perfumed extracts, would tolerate
nothing less sweet-scented, and by her prohibitory fiat, the
“bags” were denied admittance to the house. Once, when the
doctor was suddenly called to see a white member of the family,
he, either through forgetfulness or obstinacy, violated the order,
and Miss Jane had every carpet taken up and shaken, and the
floor scoured, for the odor seemed to haunt her for weeks.
Since then he had rigidly adhered to the rule; I suspect,
with many secret maledictions upon the acuteness of her
olfactories.</p>
          <p>Now he requested me to bring the bags to him, I found them,
as I had expected, sitting in the very spot where he usually
placed them.</p>
          <p>“There they are, doctor, now be quick. Cure her, help her,
do anything, but let her not die whilst this money can
purchase her life, or afford her ease.”</p>
          <p>He took the coin from my hand, surveyed it for a moment, a
thing that I considered very cruel, for, all the while, the victim
was suffering uncared for, unattended to.</p>
          <p>“It is but a small piece, doctor, but it is my all; if I had
<pb id="browne146" n="146"/>
more, you should have it, but now please be quick in the
application of your remedy.”</p>
          <p>“This money will pay but for a few leeches, not enough to
do the contusion much good. You see there is a great deal of
diseased blood collected at the left temple; but I'll be charitable
and throw in a few leeches, for which you can pay me at some
other time, when you happen to have money.”</p>
          <p>“Certainly, doctor, I will give you <hi rend="italics">all</hi> that you demand as
fast as I get it.”</p>
          <p>After a little scarification he applied the leeches, twelve in
number, little, sleek, sharp, needle-pointed, oily-looking things.
Quickly, as if starved, the tiny vampires commenced their work
of blood-sucking.</p>
          <p>“She bore to be scarified better than any subject I ever saw.
Not a writhe or wince,” remarked the doctor.</p>
          <p>Ah, thought I, she has endured too much pain to tremble at
a needle prick like that. She, whose body had bled at every
pore, whose skin had been torn and mangled until it bore a
thousand scars, could surely bear, without writhing, a pain so
delicate as that. Though I thought thus, I said not a word;
for (to me) the worst part of our slavery is that we are not
allowed to speak our opinion on any subject. We are to be
mutes, save when it suits our owners to let us answer in words
obsequious enough to please their greedy love of authority.</p>
          <p>Silently I stood watching the leeches. From the loss of
blood, Aunt Polly seemed somewhat exhausted, and was soon
soundly, sweetly sleeping.</p>
          <p>“Let her sleep,” said the doctor, as he removed the leeches
and replaced them in a little stone vase, “when she wakes she will
probably be better, and you will then owe me one dollar and a
half, as the bill is two dollars. It would have been more, but
I allow part to go for charity.” So saying he left the cabin
and returned to the house. Oh, most noble Christian “charity”!
Is this the blessed quality that is destined to “cover a multitude
of sins”? He would not even leech a half-dying woman
without a pecuniary reward. Oh, far advanced whites, fast
growing in grace and ripening in holiness!</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE ESSAY OF WIT—YOUNG ABOLITIONIST—HIS INFLUENCE—A NIGHT AT THE DOOR OF THE “LOCK-UP.”</p>
          </argument>
          <p>AFTER wiping the fresh blood-stains (produced by the severe
beating of Mr. Peterkin) from Aunt Polly's shoulders, and binding
up her brow to conceal the wounds made by the leeching
process, I tenderly spread the old coverlet over her form, and
then turned away from her to go about my usual avocations.</p>
          <p>The doctor was just making his <foreign lang="fre">adieux</foreign>, and the ladies had
gathered round him in quite a social and sportive way. Misses
Jane and Tildy were playfully disputing which one should take
possession of his heart and hand, in the event of Mrs. Mandy's
sudden demise. All this merriment and light-heartedness was
exhibited, when but a few rods from them a poor, old, faithful
creature lay in the agonies of a torturing death, and a young
girl, who had striven for her liberty, and tried to achieve it at
a perilous risk, had just been bound, hand and foot, and cast
into outer darkness! Oh, this was a strange, meeting of the
extremes. What varied colors the glass of life can show!</p>
          <p>At length, with many funny speeches, and promises very
ridiculous, the doctor tore himself away from the chatty group.</p>
          <p>Passing in and out of the house, through the hall or in the
parlor, as my business required, I saw Mr. Worth and Miss
Bradly sitting quietly and moodily apart, whilst, occasionally,
Miss Tildy would flash out with a coarse joke, or Miss Jane
would speculate upon the feelings of Lindy, in her present
helpless and gloomy confinement.</p>
          <p>“I reckon she does not relish Canada about this time.”</p>
          <p>“No; let us ask her <hi rend="italics">candid</hi> opinion of it,” said Miss Tildy,
<pb id="browne148" n="148"/>
who considered herself <hi rend="italics">the wit</hi> of the family, and this last speech
she regarded as quite an extraordinary flash.</p>
          <p>“That's very good, Till,” said her patronizing sister, “but
you are always witty.”</p>
          <p>“Now, sister, ain't you ashamed to flatter me so?” and with
the most Laura Matilda-ish air, she turned her head aside and
tried to blush.</p>
          <p>I could read, from his clear, manly glance, that Mr. Worth
was sick at heart and goaded to anguish by what he saw and
heard; yet, like many another noble man, he sat in silent
endurance. Miss Jane caught the idea of his gloom, and, with a
good deal of sly, vulpine malice, determined to annoy him. She
had not for him, as Miss Tildy had, a personal admiration; so,
by way of vexing him, as well as showing off her smartness,
she asked:</p>
          <p>“Till, is there much Worth in Abolitionism?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, but there is a <hi rend="italics">Robin</hi> in it.” This she thought
a capital repartee.</p>
          <p>“Bravo! bravo, Till! who can equal you? You are the wittiest
girl in town or country.”</p>
          <p>“Wit is a precious gift,” said Mr. Worth, as he satirically
elevated his brows.</p>
          <p>“Indeed is it,” replied Miss Tildy, “but I am not conscious
of its possession.” Of course she expected he would gainsay
her; but, as he was silent, her cheeks blazed like a peony.</p>
          <p>“What makes Miss Bradly so quiet and seemingly lachrymose?
I do believe Johnny's Abolition lecture has given her the
blues.”</p>
          <p>“Not the lecture, but the necessity for the lecture,” put in
Mr. Worth.</p>
          <p>“What's that? what's that 'bout Aberlitionists?” exclaimed
Mr. Peterkin, as he rushed into the room. “Is there one of
'em here? Let me know it, and my roof shan't shelter the
rascal. Whar is he?”</p>
          <p>I looked toward Mr. Worth, for I feared that, on an occasion
like this, his principles would fail as Miss Bradly's had;
<pb id="browne149" n="149"/>
but the fear was quickly dissipated, as he replied in a manly
tone:</p>
          <p>“I, a vindicator of the anti-slavery policy, and a denouncer
of the slave system, stand before you, and declare myself proud
of my sentiments.”</p>
          <p>“You? ha! ha! ha! ha! that's too ridiculous; a mere boy;
a stripling, no bigger than my arm. I'd not disgrace my
manhood with a fight with the like of yer.”</p>
          <p>“So thought Goliath when David met him in warfare; but
witness the sequel, and then say if the battle is always to the
strong, or the victory with the proud. Might is not always
right. I ask to be heard for my cause. Stripling as you call
me, I am yet able to vindicate my abolition principles upon
other and higher ground than mere brute force.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes; you has larnt, I s'pose, to talk. That's all them
windy Aberlitionists ken do; they berate and talk, but they
can't act.”</p>
          <p>A contemptuous smile played over the face of Mr. Worth,
but he did not deign to answer with words.</p>
          <p>“Do you know, pa, that Johnny is an Abolitionist?” asked
Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“What! John Peterkin? my son John?”</p>
          <p>“The same,” and Miss Jane bowed most significantly.</p>
          <p>“Well, that's funny enuff; but I'll soon bring it outen him.
He's a quiet lad; not much sperrit, and I guess he's hearn
some 'cock and bull story' 'bout freedom and equality. All
smart boys of his age is apt to feel that way, but he'll come
outen it. It's all bekase he has hearn too many Fourth of July
speeches; but I don't fear fur him, he is sure to come outen
it. The very idee of my son's being an Aberlitionist is too
funny.”</p>
          <p>“Funny is it, father, for your child to love mercy, and deal
justly, even with the lowliest?” As he said this, young master
stood in the doorway. He looked paler and even more spiritual
than was his wont.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin sat for full five minutes, gazing at the boy;
<pb id="browne150" n="150"/>
and, strange to say, made no reply, but strode away from the
room.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane and Tildy regarded each other with evident surprise.
They had expected a violent outburst, and thus to see
their father tamed and subdued by the word and glance of
their boy-brother, astonished them not a little.</p>
          <p>Miss Tildy turned toward young master, and said, in what
was meant for a most caustic tone,</p>
          <p>“You are an embryo Van Amburgh, thus to tame the lion's
rage.”</p>
          <p>“But you, Tilly, are too vulpine to be fascinated even by
the glance of Van Amburgh himself.”</p>
          <p>“Well, now, Johnny, you are getting impertinent as well as
spicy.”</p>
          <p>“Pertinent, you mean,” said Mr. Worth. Miss Tildy would
not look angry at <hi rend="italics">him</hi>; for she was besieging the fortress of his
affections, and she deemed kind measures the most
advantageous.</p>
          <p>Were I to narrate most accurately the conversation that followed,
the repartees that flashed from the lips of some, and the
anger that burned blue in the faces of others, I should only
amuse the reader, or what is more likely, weary him.</p>
          <p>I will simply mention that, after a few hours' sojourn, Mr.
Worth took his departure, not without first having a long
conversation, in a private part of the garden, with young master.
Miss Bradly retired to the young ladies' room (for they would
not allow her to leave the house), under pretext of headache.
Often, as I passed in and out to ask her if she needed anything,
I found her weeping bitterly. Late in the evening, about eight
o'clock, Mr. Peterkin returned; throwing the reins of his horse
to Nace, he exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“Well, I've made a good bargain of it; I've sold Lindy to a
trader for one thousand dollars—that is, if she answers the
description which I gave of her. He is comin' in the mornin', to
look at her; and, with a little riggin' up, I think she'll 'pear a
rale good-lookin' wench.”</p>
          <pb id="browne151" n="151"/>
          <p>When I went into the house to prepare some supper for Mr.
Peterkin (the family tea had been despatched two hours before),
he was in an excellent humor, well pleased, no doubt, with his
good trade.</p>
          <p>“Now, Ann, be brisk and smart, or you might find yourself
in the trader's hands afore long. Likely yellow gals like you
sells mighty well; and if you doesn't behave well you is a
goner.”</p>
          <p>“Down the river” was not terrible to me, nor did I dread
being “sold;” yet one thing I did fear, and that was separation
from young master. In the last few days he had become to me
everything I could respect; nay, I loved him. Not that it
was in his power to do me any signal act of good. He could
not soften the severity of his father and sisters toward me; yet
one thing he could and did do, he spoke an occasional kind,
hopeful word to me. Those whose hearts are fed upon kindness
and love, can little understand how dear to the lonely, destitute
soul, is one word of friendliness. We, to whom the husks
are flung with an unfeeling tone, appreciate as manna from
heaven the word of gentleness; and now I thought if I were
to leave young Master <hi rend="italics">my soul would die</hi>. Had not his
blessed smile elevated and inspired my sinking spirit, and his
sweet tone softened my over-taxed heart? Oh, blessed one!
even now I think of thee, and with a full heart thank God that
such beings have lived!</p>
          <p>I watched master dispatch his supper in a most summary
manner. At length he settled himself back in his chair, and,
taking his tooth-pick from his waistcoat pocket, began picking
his teeth.</p>
          <p>“Wal, Ann,” he said, as he swung himself back in his chair,
how's ole Poll?”</p>
          <p>“She is still asleep.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I said she was possuming; but by to-morrow, if she
ain't up outen that ar' bunk of hers, I'll know the reason; and
I'll sell her to the trader that's comin' for Lindy.”</p>
          <p>“I wish you would sell her, father, and buy a new cook;
<pb id="browne152" n="152"/>
she prepares everything in such an old-fashioned manner—can't
make a single French dish,” said Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“I don't care a cuss 'bout yer French dishes, or yer fashionable
cooks; I's gwine to sell her, becase the craps didn't yield
me much this year, and I wants money, so I must make it by
sellin' off niggers.”</p>
          <p>“You must not sell Aunt Polly, and you shall not,” said
young master, with a fearful emphasis.</p>
          <p>“What do you mean, lad?” cried the infuriated father, and
he sprang from his seat, and was in the very act of rushing
upon the offender; but suddenly he quailed before the fixed,
determined gaze of that eye. He looked again, then cowered,
reeled, and staggered like a drunken man, and, falling back in
his chair, he covered his face with his hands, and uttered a
fearful groan. The ladies were frightened; they had never
seen their father thus fearfully excited. They dared not speak
one word. The finger of an awful silence seemed laid upon
each and every one present. At length young master, with a
slow step, approached his father, and, taking the large hand,
which swung listlessly, within his own, said, “Fath—;” but
before he had finished the syllable, Mr. Peterkin sprang up,
exclaiming,</p>
          <p>“Off, I say! off! off! she sent you here; she told you to speak
so to me.” Then gazing wildly at Johnny, he cried, “Those
are her eyes, that is her face. I say, away! away! leave me!
you torment me with the sight of that face! It's her's it's hers.
Blood will have blood, and now you comes to git mine!” and
the strong man fell prostrate upon the floor, in a paroxysm of
agony. He foamed at the mouth, and rolled his great vacant
eyes around the room in a wildness fearful to behold.</p>
          <p>“Oh Lor',” said old Nace, who appeared in the doorway,
“oh Lor', him's got a fit.”</p>
          <p>The ladies shrieked and screamed in a frightful manner.
Young master was almost preternaturally calm. He and Miss
Bradly (after Nace and Jake had placed master on the bed)
rendered him every attention. Miss Bradly chafed his temples
<pb id="browne153" n="153"/>
with camphor, and moistened the lips and palms of the hands
with it. When he began to revive, he turned his face to the
wall and wept like a child. Then he fell off into a quiet sleep.</p>
          <p>Young master and Miss Bradly watched beside that restless
sleeper long and faithfully. And from that night there grew
up between them a fervent friendship, which endured to the
last of their mortal days.</p>
          <p>Upon frequently going into Aunt Polly's cabin, I was
surprised to find her still sleeping. At length when my duties
were all discharged in the house, and I went to prepare for the
night's rest, I thought I would arouse her from her torpor and
administer a little nourishment that might benefit her.</p>
          <p>To my surprise her arm felt rigid, and oh, so cold! What if
she is dead! thought I; and a cold thrill passed over my frame.
The big drops burst from my brow and stood in chilly dew
upon my temples. Oh God! can it be that she is dead! One
look, one more touch, and the dreadful question would be
answered; yet, when I attempted to stretch forth my hand, it was
stiff and powerless. In a moment the very atmosphere seemed
to grow heavy; 'twas peopled with a strange, charnel gloom.
My breath was thick and broken, coming only at intervals and
with choking gaspings. One more desperate effort! I commanded
myself, gathered all my courage, and, seizing hold of
the body with a power which was stronger than my own, I
turned it over—when, oh God of mercy, such a spectacle! the
question was answered with a fearful affirmation. There, rigid,
still and ghastly, she lay in death. The evident marks of a
violent struggle were stamped upon those features, which, despite
their tough hard-favoredness, and their gaunt gloom, were
dear to me; for had she not been my best of friends, nay proved
her friendship by a martyrdom which, if slower, was no less
heroic than that which adorns the columns of historical
renown? Gently I closed those wide-staring, blank eyes, and
pressed tenderly together the distended jaws; and, taking from
a box a slipet of white muslin, bound up her cheeks. Slowly,
and not without a feeling of terror, I unwound the bandage from
<pb id="browne154" n="154"/>
her brow, which concealed the wound made by the leeches; this
I replaced with my only handkerchief. I then endeavored to
straighten the contracted limbs, for she had died lying upon
her side, with her body drawn nearly double. I found this a
rather difficult task; yet was it a melancholy pleasure, a duty
that I performed irresolutely but with tenderness.</p>
          <p>After all was done, and before getting the water to wash the
body (for I wished to enrobe her decently for the burial), I
gave way to the luxury of expressed grief, and, sinking down
upon my knees beside that lifeless form, thanked God for having
taken her from this scene of trouble and trial. “You are
gone, my poor old friend; but that hereafter of which we all
entertain so much dread, cannot be to you so bad as this wretched
present; and though I am lonely without you, I rejoice that
you have left this land of bondage. And I believe that at this
moment your tried soul is free and happy!”</p>
          <p>So saying, I stepped without the door of the cabin, and, looking
up to the clear, cold moon and the way-off stars, I smiled,
even in my bitterness, for I imagined I could see her emancipated
soul soaring away on its new-made wings, to the land
forever flowing with milk and honey. She had often in her
earth-pilgrimage, as many tried martyrs had done before her,
fainted by the wayside; but then was she not sorely tempted, and
did not a life of captivity and seven-fold agony, atone for all her
short-comings? Besides, we are divinely informed that where
little is given, little is required. In view of this sacred assurance,
let not the sceptic reader think that my faith was stretched to
an unwarranted degree. Yes, I did and <hi rend="italics">do</hi> think that she was
at that moment and is now happy. If not, how am I to
account for the strange feeling of peace that settled over my
mind and heart, when I thought of her! For a holy, heavenly
calm, like the dropping of a prophet's mantle, overspread my
heart; a cool sense of ease, refreshing as the night dew, and
sustaining as the high stars, seemed to gird me round!</p>
          <p>I did not heed the cold air, but walked out a few rods in the
direction of the out-house, where Lindy was confined. “Yonder,”
<pb id="browne155" n="155"/>
I soliloquized, “perishing for a kind word, lies a poor outcast,
wretched being. I will go to her, bury all thoughts of the past,
and speak one kind word of encouragement.”</p>
          <p>As I drew near to the “lock-up,” the moon that had been
sailing swift and high through the heaven, passed beneath the
screen of a dark cloud. I paused in my steps and looked up
to the sky. “Such,” I thought, “is the transit of a human
soul across the vault of life; beneath clouds and shadows the
serene face is often hidden, and the spirit's mellow light is often,
by affliction, obscured from view.</p>
          <p>Just then a sob of anguish fell upon my ear. I knew it was
Lindy, and moved hastily forward; but, light as was my
foot-fall, it aroused the sentinel-dog, and, with a loud bark, he
sprang toward me. “Down, Cuff! down!” said I, addressing
the dog, who, as soon as he recognized me, crouched lovingly at
my feet. Just then the moon glided with a queenly air from
behind the clouds. “So,” I said, “passeth the soul, with the
same Diana-like sweep, from the heavy fold and curtain of
human sorrow.” Another moan, deeper and more fearful than
the first! I was close beside the door of the “lock-up,” and,
cowering down, with my mouth close to the crevice, I called
Lindy. “Who's dar? who's dar? For de love of heaven
somebody come to me,” said Lindy, in a half-frantic tone.</p>
          <p>“ 'Tis I, Lindy, don't you know my voice?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, it's Ann! Oh, please, Ann, help me outen here.
I's seen such orful sights and hearn sich dreful sounds, I'd be a
slave all my born days jist to git way frum here. Oh, Ann,
I's seed a <hi rend="italics">speerit</hi>,” and then she gave such a fearful shriek,
that I felt my flesh grow cold and stony as death. Yet I knew
it was my duty to appear calm, and try to persuade her that it
was not true or real.</p>
          <p>“Oh, no, Lindy, you must not be frightened; only hope and
trust in God, and pray to Him. He will take you away from
all this trouble. He loves you. He cares for you, for 'twas
He who made you<corr sic=",">.</corr> Your soul is precious to Him. Oh, try to
pray.”</p>
          <pb id="browne156" n="156"/>
          <p>“Oh, but, Ann, I doesn't know how to pray. I never seed
God, and I is afraid of Him. He might be like master.”</p>
          <p>This was fearful ignorance, and how to begin to teach her the
way to believe was above my ability; yet I knew that every
soul was precious to God; so I made an endeavor to do all I could
in the way of instruction.</p>
          <p>“Say, Our Father, who art in heaven,<corr/> Lindy.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Our Father, who art in heaven,” she repeated in a slow,
nervous manner.</p>
          <p>“Hallowed be Thy name.” Again she repeated, and so on
we prayed, she following accurately after me, though the heavy
door separated us. Think ye not, oh, gentle reader, that this
prayer was heard above? Never did words come more truly
from my heart; and with a low moan, they rung plaintively
upon the still, moonlit air! I could tell, from the fervent tone
in which Lindy followed, that her whole soul was engaged.
When the final amen had been said, she asked, “Ann, what's
to become of me?”</p>
          <p>I evaded her by saying, “how can I know what master will
do?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but haven't you heard? Oh, don't fool me, Ann, but
tell me all.”</p>
          <p>For a moment I hesitated, then said: “Yes, Lindy, I'll deal
fairly with you. I have heard that master intends selling
you to-morrow to a trader, whom he went to see to-day; and,
if the trader is satisfied with you to-morrow, the bargain will
be closed.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord! oh, Lord!” she groaned forth, “oh, is I gwine
down de ribber? Oh, Lord, kill me right now; but don't send
me to dat dreful place, down de ribber, down de ribber!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, trust in the Lord, and He will protect you. Down the
river can't be much worse than here, maybe not so bad. For
my part, Lindy, I would rather be sold and run the risk of getting
a good master, than remain here where we are treated
worse than dogs.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, dar isn't no sort ob hope ob my gitten any better home
<pb id="browne157" n="157"/>
den dis here one; den I knows you all, and way off dar 'mong
strange black folks, oh, no, I never can go; de Lord hab marcy
on me.”</p>
          <p>This begging of the poor negroes to the Lord to have mercy
on them, though frequent, has no particular significance<corr sic=",">.</corr> It is
more a plaint of agony than a cry for actual mercy; and, in
Lindy's case, it most assuredly only expressed her grief, for she
had no ripe faith in the power and willingness of Our Father to
send mercy to her. Religion she believed consisted in going to
church every Sunday twice; consequently it was a luxury,
which, like all luxuries, must be monopolized by the whites.
From the very depths of my heart I prayed that the light of
Divine grace might shine in upon her darkened intellect. Soul
of Faith, verily art thou soul of beauty! And though, as a
special gift, faith is not withheld from the lowliest, the most
ignorant, yet does its possession give to the poorest and most
degraded Ethiopian a divine consciousness, an inspiration, that
as to what is grandest in the soul exalts him above the noblest
of poets.</p>
          <p>Whilst talking to Lindy, I was surprised to hear the muffled
sound of an approaching footstep. Noiselessly I was trying to
creep away, when young master said in a low voice:</p>
          <p>“Is this you, Ann? Wait a moment. Have you spoken to
Lindy? Have you told her—”</p>
          <p>He did not finish the sentence, and I answered,</p>
          <p>“Yes, I have told her that she is to be sold, and to a trader.”</p>
          <p>“Is she willing?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, she has a great terror of down the river.”</p>
          <p>“That is the way with them all, yet her condition, so far as
treatment is concerned, may be bettered, certainly it cannot be
made worse.”</p>
          <p>“Will you speak to her, young Master, and reconcile her to
her situation?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I will do all I can.”</p>
          <p>“And now I will go and stay with the corpse of dear Aunt
Polly;” here I found it impossible to restrain my tears, and,
<pb id="browne158" n="158"/>
convulsed with emotion, I seated myself upon the ground with
my back against the door of the lock-up.</p>
          <p>“Dead? dead? Aunt Polly dead?” he asked in a bewildered
tone.</p>
          <p>“Yes, young Master, I found her dead, and with every
appearance of having had a severe struggle.”</p>
          <p>I then told him about the leeching process, how the doctor
had acted, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>“Murdered! She was most cruelly murdered!” he murmured
to himself.</p>
          <p>In the excitement of conversation he had elevated his tone a
good deal, and the fearful news reached the ears of Lindy, and
she shrieked out,</p>
          <p>“Is Aunt Polly dead? Oh, tell me, for I thinks I sees her
sperit now.”</p>
          <p>Then such entreaties as she made to get out were agonizing
to hear.</p>
          <p>“Oh, if you can't let me out, don't leave me! Oh, don't leave
me, Ann! I is so orful skeered. I do see such terrible sights,
and it 'pears like when you is here talking, dem orful things
don't come arter me.”</p>
          <p>“You go, Ann, and watch with Aunt Polly's body; I will
stay here with this poor creature.”</p>
          <p>“What, you, young master; no, no, you shall not, it will kill
you. Your cough will increase, and it might prove fatal. No,
I will stay here.”</p>
          <p>“But who will watch with Aunt Polly?”</p>
          <p>“I will awaken Amy, and make her keep guard.”</p>
          <p>“No, she is too young, lacks nerve, will be frightened;
besides, you must not be found here in the morning. You would
be severely punished for it. Go now, good Ann, and leave me
here.”</p>
          <p>“No, young master, I cannot leave you to what I am sure
will be certain death.”</p>
          <p>“That would be no misfortune to me.”</p>
          <pb id="browne159" n="159"/>
          <p>And I shall never forget the calm and half-glorified
expression of his face, as he pronounced these words.</p>
          <p>“Go, Ann,” he continued, leave me to watch and pray beside
this forlorn creature, and, if the Angel of Death spreads his
wings on this midnight blast, I think I should welcome him;
for life, with its broken promises and its cold humanity, sickens
me—oh so much.</p>
          <p>And his beautiful head fell languidly on his breast; and again
I listened to that low, husky cough. To-night it had an unusual
sound, and, forgetful of the humble relation in which I stood to
him, I grasped his arm firmly but lovingly, saying,</p>
          <p>“Hark to that cough! Now you <hi rend="italics">must</hi> go in.”</p>
          <p>“No, I cannot. I know best; besides, since nothing less
gentle will do, I needs must use authority, and command you
to go.”</p>
          <p>“I would that you did not exercise your authority against
yourself.”</p>
          <p>But he waved me off. Reluctantly I obeyed him. Again I
entered the cabin and roused Amy, who slept on a pallet or heap
of straw at the foot of the bed, where the still, unbreathing form
of my old friend lay. It was difficult to awake her, for she was
always wearied at night, and slept with that deep soundness
peculiar to healthful childhood; but, after various shakes, I
contrived to make her open her eyes and speak to me.</p>
          <p>“Come Amy,” I said, “rouse, I want you to help me.”</p>
          <p>“In what way and what fur you wake me up?” she said as
she sat upright on the straw, and began rubbing her eyes.</p>
          <p>“Never mind, but you get up and I will tell you.”</p>
          <p>When she was fairly awake, she assisted me in lifting in a
large tub of water.</p>
          <p>“Oh, is Aunt Polly any sicker?” she inquired.</p>
          <p>“Amy, she is dead.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord, den I ain't gwine to hope you, bekase I's afeared
ob a dead body.”</p>
          <p>“It can't harm you.”</p>
          <pb id="browne160" n="160"/>
          <p>“Yes it ken; anyhow, I is feared ob it, and I ain't gwine to
hope you.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you need not touch her, only sit up with me whilst I
wash her and dress her nicely.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I'll do dat much.”</p>
          <p>Accordingly, she crouched down in the corner and concealed
her face with her hands, whilst I proceeded to wash the body
thoroughly and dress it out in an old faded calico, which, in life,
had constituted her finest robe. Bare and undecked, but clean,
appeared that tabernacle of flesh, which had once enshrined a
tried but immortal spirit. When all was finished, I seated myself
near the partly-opened door, and waited for the coming of
day. Ah, when was the morn of glad freedom to break for me?</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>SYMPATHY CASTETH OUT FEAR—CONSEQUENCE OF 
THE NIGHT'S WATCH—TROUBLED REFLECTIONS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>MORN did break, bright and clear, over the face of the sleeping
earth! It was a still and blessed hour. Man, hushed from his
rushing activity, lay reposeful in the arms of “Death's
counterfeit-sleep.” All animated nature was quiet and calm, till,
suddenly, a gush of melody broke from the clear throats of the
wildwood birds and made the air vocal. Another day was
dawning; another day born to witness sins and cruelties the
most direful. Do we not often wonder why the sky can smile
so blue and lovingly, when such outrages are enacted beneath
it? But I must not anticipate.</p>
          <p>As soon as the sun had fairly risen I knocked at the house-door,
which was opened by Miss Bradly, whose languid face and
crumpled dress, proved that she had taken no rest during the
night. Bidding her a polite good-morning, I inquired if the
ladies had risen? She answered that they were still asleep,
and had rested well during the night. I next inquired for
master's health.</p>
          <p>“Oh,” said she, “I think he is well, quite well again. He
slept soundly. I think he only suffered from a violent and
sudden mental excitement. A good night's rest, and a sedative
that I administered, have restored him; but <hi rend="italics">to-day</hi>, oh, <hi rend="italics">to-day</hi>,
how I do dread to-day.”</p>
          <p>To the latter part of this speech I made no answer; for, of
late, I had learned to distrust her. Even if her belief was right,
I could not recognize her as one heroic enough to promulgate it
<pb id="browne162" n="162"/>
from the house-tops. I saw in her only a weak, servile soul,
drawn down from the lofty purpose of philanthropy, seduced by
the charm of “vile lucre.” Therefore I observed a rigid silence.
Feeling a little embarrassed, I began playing with the strings
of my apron, for I was fearful that the expression of my face
might betray what was working in my mind.</p>
          <p>“What is the matter, Ann?”</p>
          <p>This recalled the tragedy that had occurred in the cabin, and
I said, in a faltering tone,</p>
          <p>“Death has been among us. Poor Aunt Polly is gone.”</p>
          <p>“Is it? When did she die? Poor old creature!”</p>
          <p>“She died some time before midnight. When I left the
house I was surprised to find her still sleeping, so I thought
perhaps she was too sluggish, and, upon attempting to arouse
her, I discovered that she was dead!”</p>
          <p>“Why did you not come and inform me? I would have
assisted you in the last sad offices.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I did not like to disturb you. I did everything very
well myself.”</p>
          <p>“Johnny and I sat up all night; that is, I suppose he was up,
though he left the room a little after midnight, and has not since
returned. I should not wonder if he has been walking the better
part of the night. He so loves solitude and the night-time—
but then,” she added, musingly “he has a bad cough, and it
may be dangerous. The night was chilly, the atmosphere
heavy. What if this imprudence should rapidly develop a
fearful disease?” she seemed much concerned.</p>
          <p>“I will go,” said she, “and search for him;” but ere these
word had fairly died upon her lips, we were startled by a
cough, and, looking up, we beheld the subject of our conversation
within a few steps of us. Oh, how wretchedly he was
changed! It appeared as if the wreck of years had been
accomplished in the brief space of a night. Haggard and pale,
with his eyes roving listlessly, dark purple lines of unusual
depth surrounding them, and with his bright, gold hair, heavy
with the dew, and hanging neglected around his noble head,
<pb id="browne163" n="163"/>
even his clear, pearl-like complexion appeared dark and
discolored.</p>
          <p>“Where have you been, Johnny?” asked Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>To commune with the lonely and comfort the bound; at the
door of the ‘lock-up,’ our miniature <sic corr="Bastille">Bastile</sic>, I have spent the
night. Here commenced a paroxysm of coughing, so violent
that he was obliged to seat himself upon the door-sill.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Johnny,” exclaimed the terrified lady.</p>
          <p>But as he attempted to check her fears, another paroxysm,
still more frightful, took place, and this time the blood gushed
copiously from his mouth. Miss Bradly threw her arms
tenderly around him, and, after a succession of rapid gushes of
blood, his head fell languidly on her shoulder, like a pale, broken
lily!</p>
          <p>I instantly ran to call up the ladies, when master approached
from his chamber; seeing young master lying so pale, cold, and
insensible in the arms of Miss Bradly, he concluded he was
dead, and, crying out in a frantic tone, he asked,</p>
          <p>“In h—l's name, what has happened to my boy?”</p>
          <p>“He has had a violent hemorrhage,” replied Miss Bradly,
with an ill-disguised composure.</p>
          <p>The sight of the blood, which lay in puddles and clots over
the steps, increased the terror of the father, and, frantically
seizing his boy in his arms, he covered the still, pale face with
kisses.</p>
          <p>“Oh, my boy! my boy! how much you are like <hi rend="italic s">her</hi>! This
is her mouth, eyes, and nose, and now you 'pears jist like she
did when I seed her last. These limbs are stiff and frozen.
It can't be death; no, it can't be. I haven't killed you, too—
say, Miss Bradly, is he dead?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, only exhausted from the violence of the paroxysm,
and the copious hemorrhage, but he requires immediate medical
treatment; send, promptly, for Dr. Mandy.”</p>
          <p>Master turned to me, saying,</p>
          <p>“Gal, go order Jake to mount the swiftest horse, and ride
<pb id="browne164" n="164"/>
for life and death to Dr. Mandy; tell him to come instantly,
my son is dying.”</p>
          <p>I obeyed, and, with all possible promptitude, the message
was dispatched. Oh, how different when <hi rend="italics">his</hi> son was ill. Then
you could see that human life was valuable; had it been a
negro, he would have waited until after breakfast before
sending for a doctor.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin bore his son into the house, placed him on the
bed, and, seating himself beside him, watched with a tenderness
that I did not think belonged to his harsh nature.</p>
          <p>In a very short time Jake returned with Dr. Mandy, who,
after feeling young master's pulse, sounding his chest, and
applying the stethescope, said that he feared it was an incipient
form of lung-fever. We had much cause for apprehension.
There was a perplexed expression upon the face of the doctor,
a tremulousness in his motions, which indicated that he was in
great fear and doubt as to the case. He left some powders, to
be administered every hour, and, after various and repeated
injunctions to Miss Bradly, who volunteered to nurse the patient,
he left the house.</p>
          <p>After taking the first powder, young master lay in a deep,
unbroken sleep As I stood by his bedside I saw how
altered he was. The cheek, which, when he was walking, had
seemed round and full, was now shrunk and hollow, and a fiery
spot burned there like a living coal; and the dark, purple ring
that encircled the eyes, and the sharp contraction of the thin
nostril, were to me convincing omens of the grave. Then, too,
the anxious, care-written face of Miss Bradly tended to deepen
my apprehension. How my friends were falling around me!
Now, just when I was beginning to live, came the fell destroyer
of my happiness. Happiness? Oh, does it not seem a mockery
for the slave to employ that word? As if he had anything to do
with it! The slave, who owns nothing, ay, literally nothing.
His wife and children are all his master's. His very wearing
apparel becomes another's. He has no right to use it, save as
he is advised by his owner. Go, my kind reader, to the hotels
<pb id="browne165" n="165"/>
of the South and South-west, look at the worn and dejected
countenances of the slaves, and tell me if you do not read
misery there. Look in at the saloons of the restaurants,
coffee-houses, &amp;c., at late hours of the night; there you will see them,
tired, worn and weary, with their aching heads bandaged up,
sighing for a few moments' sleep. There the proud, luxurious,
idle whites sip their sherbets, drink wine, and crack their
ever-lasting jokes, but there must stand your obsequious slave, with
a smile on his face, waiter in hand, ready to attend to “Master's
slightest wish.” No matter if his tooth is aching, or his child
dying, he must smile, or be flogged for gruffness. This “chattel
personal,” though he bear the erect form of a man, has no
right to any privileges or emotions. Oh, nation of the free, how
long shall this be? Poor, suffering Africa, country of my
sires, how much longer upon thy bleeding shoulders must the
cross be pressed! Is there no tomb where, for a short space,
thou shalt lie, and then, bursting the bonds of night and
death, spring up free, redeemed and regenerate?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, will he die?” I murmured, “he who reconciles me to
my bondage, who is my only friend? Another affliction I
cannot bear; I've been so tried in the furnace, that I have not
strength to meet another.”</p>
          <p>Those thoughts passed through my brain as I stood beside
young master; but the entrance of Mr. Peterkin diverted them,
and stepping up to him, I said, “Master, Aunt Polly is dead.”</p>
          <p>“You lie!” he thundered out.</p>
          <p>“No, Mr. Peterkin, the old woman is really dead,” said Miss
Bradly, in a kind but mournful tone.</p>
          <p>“Who killed her?” again he thundered.</p>
          <p>Ay, who did kill her? Could I not have answered, “Thou
art the man<corr sic="?">.</corr>” But I did not. Silently I stood before him,
never daring to trust myself with a word.</p>
          <p>“What time did she kick the bucket?” asked Mr. Peterkin,
in one of the favorite Kentucky vulgarisms, whereby the most
solemn and awful debt of nature is ridiculed by the unthinking.
<pb id="browne166" n="166"/>
I told him how I had found her, what I had done, &amp;c., all of
which is known to the reader.</p>
          <p>“I believe h—l is loose among the niggers. Now, here's
Poll had to die bekase she couldn't cut any other caper. I
might have made a sight o' money by her sale; and she, old
fool, had to cut me outen it. Wal, I'll only have to sell some
of the others, fur I's bound to make up a sartin sum of money
to pay to some of my creditors in L—.”</p>
          <p>This speech was addressed to Miss Bradly, upon whom it
made not half the impression that it did upon me. How I
hoped I should be one, for if young master, as I began to
believe, should die soon, the place would become to me more
horrible than a tiger's den. Any change was desirable.</p>
          <p>When the young ladies rose from their beds I went in to
attend on them, and communicated the news of young master's
illness and Aunt Polly's death. For their brother they expressed
much concern, but the faithful old domestic, who had
served them so long, was of no more consequence than a dog.
Miss Jane did seem provoked to think that she “had died on
their hands,” as she expressed it. “If pa had sold her months
ago, we might have had the money, or something valuable, but
now we must go to the expense of furnishing her with a coffin.”</p>
          <p>“Coffin! hoity-toity! Father's not going to give her a coffin,
an old store-box is good enough to put her old carcass in.” And
thus they spoke of one of God's dead.</p>
          <p>Usually persons respect those upon whom death has set his
ghastly signet; but these barbarians (for such I think they
must have been) spoke with an irreverence of one whose body
lay still and cold, only few steps from them. To some people
no thing or person is sacred.</p>
          <p>After breakfast I waited in great anxiety to hear how and
when master intended to have Aunt Polly buried.</p>
          <p>I had gone into the little desolate cabin, which was now
consecrated by the presence of the dead. There <hi rend="italics">she</hi> lay, cold and
ashen; and the long white strip that I had thrown over her was
too thin to conceal the face. It was an old muslin curtain that
<pb id="browne167" n="167"/>
I had found in looking over the boxes of the deceased, and out
of respect had flung it over the remains. So rigid and
set seemed her features in that last, deep sleep, so tightly
locked were those bony fingers, so mournful looked the straightened,
stiffened form, so devoid of speculation the half-closed
eyes, that I turned away with a shudder, saying inwardly:</p>
          <p>“Oh, death, thou art revolting!” Yet when I bethought me
of the peace passing human understanding into which she had
gone, the safe bourne that she had attained, “where the wicked
cease from troubling and the weary are at rest;” when I thought
of this, death lost its horror, and the grave its gloom. Oh,
Eternity, problem that the living can never solve. Oh, death,
full of victory to the Christian! wast thou not, to my old and
weary friend, a messenger of sweet peace; and was not the
tomb a gateway to new and undreamed-of happiness? Yes, so
will I believe; for so believing am I made joyful.</p>
          <p>Relieved thus by faith from the burden of grief, I moved
gently about the room, trying to bring something like order to
its ragged appearance; for Jake, who had been dispatched for
Doctor Mandy to come and see young master, had met on the
way a colored preacher, to whom he announced Aunt Polly's
death, and who had promised to come and preach a funeral
sermon, and attend the burial. This was to the other negroes a
great treat; they regarded a funeral as quite a gala occasion,
inasmuch as we had never had such a thing upon the farm. I
had my own doubts, though I did not express them, whether
master would permit it.</p>
          <p>Young master still slept, from the strong effects of the sleeping
potion which had been administered to him. Miss Bradly,
overcome by the night's watching, dozed in a large chair beside
the bed, and an open Bible, in which she had been reading, lay
upon her lap. The blinds were closed, but the dim light of a
small fire that blazed on the hearth gave some appearance of
life to the room. Every one who passed in and out, stepped on
tip-toe, as if fearful of arousing the sleeper.</p>
          <p>Oh, the comfort of a white skin! No darkened room, no
<pb id="browne168" n="168"/>
comfortable air, marked the place where she my friend had died.
No hushed dread nor whispered voice paid respect to the cabin-room
where lay her dead body; but, thanks to God, in the
morning of the resurrection we shall come forth alike, regardless
of the distinctions of color or race, each one to render a faithful
account of the deeds done in the body.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin came to the kitchen-door, and called Nace,
saying:</p>
          <p>“Where is that old store-box that the goods and domestics
for the house was fetched home in, from L—, last fall?”</p>
          <p>“It's in de smoke-house, Masser.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, go git it, and bury ole Poll in it.”</p>
          <p>“It's right dirty and greasy, Master,” I ventured to say.</p>
          <p>“Who keres if 'tis? What right has you to speak, slut?”
and he gave me a violent kick in the side with his rough brogan.</p>
          <p>“Take that for yer imperdence. Who tole you to put yer
mouth in?”</p>
          <p>Nace and Dan soon produced the box, which had no top, and
was dirty and greasy, as it well might be from its year's lodgment
in the meat-house.</p>
          <p>“Now, go dig a hole and put Poll in it.”</p>
          <p>As master was turning away, he was met by a neatly-dressed
black man, who wore a white muslin cravat and white cotton
gloves, and carried two books in his hand. He had an humble,
reverent expression, and I readily recognized him as the free
colored preacher of the neighborhood—a good, religious man,
God-fearing and God-serving. No one knew or could say aught
against him. How I did long to speak to him; to sit at his
feet as a disciple, and learn from him heavenly truths.</p>
          <p>As master turned round, the preacher, with a polite air, took
off his hat, saying:</p>
          <p>“Your servant, Master.”</p>
          <p>“What do you want, nigger?”</p>
          <p>“Why, Master, I heard that one of your servants was dead,
and I come to ask your leave to convene the friends in a short
prayer-meeting, if you will please let us.”</p>
          <pb id="browne169" n="169"/>
          <p>“No, I be d—d if you shall, you rascally free nigger; if
you don't git yourself off my place, I'll git my cowhide to you.
I wants none of yer tom-foolery here.”</p>
          <p>“I beg Master's pardon, but I meant no harm. I generally
go to see the sick, and hold prayer over the dead.”</p>
          <p>“You doesn't do it here; and now take your dirty black hide
away, or it will be the worse for you.”</p>
          <p>Without saying one word, the mortified preacher, who had
meant well, turned away. I trust he did as the apostles of old
were bidden by their Divine Master to do, “shook the dust
from his feet against that house.” Oh, coarse and sense-bound
man, you refused entertainment to an “angel, unawares.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I sent that prayin' rascal a flyin' quick enough;” and
with this self-gratulatory remark, he entered the house.</p>
          <p>Nace and Jake carried the box into the cabin, preceded by
me.</p>
          <p>Most reverently I laid away the muslin from the face and
form; and lifting the head, while Nace assisted at the feet, we
attempted to place the body in the box, but found it impossible,
as the box was much too short. Upon Nace's representing this
difficulty to Mr. Peterkin, he only replied:</p>
          <p>“Wal, bury her on a board, without any more foolin'
'bout it.”</p>
          <p>This harsh mandate was obeyed to the letter. With great
expedition, Nace and Jake dug a hole in the earth, and laid a
few planks at the bottom, upon which I threw an old quilt, and
on that hard bed they laid her. Good and faithful servant,
even in death thou wast not allowed a bed! Over the form I
spread a covering, and the men laid a few planks, box-fashion,
over that, and then began roughly throwing on the fresh earth.
“Dust to dust,” I murmured, and, with a secret prayer, turned
from her unmarked resting-place. Mr. Peterkin expressly
ordered that it should not have a grave shape, and so it was
patted and smoothed down, until, save for the moisture and
fresh color of the earth, you could not have known that the
ground had ever been broken.</p>

            <p>THE TRADER—A TERRIBLE FRIGHT—POWER OF PRAYER—
GRIEF OF THE HELPLESS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ABOUT noon a gaudily-dressed and rough-looking man rode
up to the gate, and alighted from a fine bay horse. With that
free and easy sort of way so peculiar to a <hi rend="italics">certain class</hi> of
man-kind, he walked up the avenue to the front door.</p>
          <p>“Gal,” he said, addressing me, “whar's yer master?”</p>
          <p>“In the house. Will you walk in?”</p>
          <p>“No, it is skersely worth while; jist tell him that me, Bill
Tompkins, wants to see him; but stay,” he added, as I was
turning to seek my master, “is you the gal he sold to me
yesterday?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, you is devilish likely. Put out yer foot. Wal, it is
nice enuff to belong to a white 'ooman. You is a bright-colored
mulatto. I <hi rend="italics">must</hi> have you.”</p>
          <p>“Heavens! I hope not,” was my half-uttered expression, as
I turned away, for I had caught the meaning of that lascivious
eye, and shrank from the threatened danger. Though I had
been cruelly treated, yet had I been allowed to retain my person
inviolate; and I would rather, a thousand-fold, have endured
the brutality of Mr. Peterkin, than those loathsome looks which
I felt betokened ruin.</p>
          <p>“Master, a man, calling himself Bill Tompkins, wishes to see
you,” said I, as I entered his private apartment.</p>
          <p>“Can't yer say Mr. Tompkins?”</p>
          <p>“He told me to tell you Bill Tompkins; I only repeat his
words.”</p>
          <p>“Whar is he?”</p>
          <pb id="browne171" n="171"/>
          <p>“At the front door.”</p>
          <p>“Didn't yer ax him in, hussy?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, but he refused, saying it was not worth while.”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” thought I, when left alone, “am I sold to that monster?
Am I to become so utterly degraded? No, no; rather
than yield my purity I will give up my life, and trust to God
to pardon the suicide.”</p>
          <p>In this state of mind I wandered up and down the yard, into
the kitchen, into the cabin, into the room where young master
lay sleeping, into the presence of the young ladies, and out
again into the air; yet my curious, feverish restlessness, could
not be allayed. A trader was in the house—a bold, obscene
man, and into his possession I might fall! Oh, happy indeed
must be those who feel that he or they have the exclusive custody
of their own persons; but the poor negro has nothing, not
even—save in rare cases—the liberty of choosing a home.</p>
          <p>I had not dared, since daylight, to go near the “lock-up,”
for a fearful punishment would have been due the one whom
Mr. Peterkin found loitering there.</p>
          <p>I was so tortured by apprehension, that my eyes burned and
my head ached. I had heard master say that the unlooked-for
death of Aunt Polly would force him to sell some of the other
slaves, in order to realize a certain sum of money, and
Tompkins had expressed a desire for me. It was likely that he
would offer a good price; then should I be lost. Oh, heavenly
Virtue! do not desert me! Let me bear up under the fiercest
trials!</p>
          <p>I had wandered about, in this half-crazed manner, never daring
to venture within “ear-shot” of master and Mr. Tompkins,
fearing that the latter might, upon a second sight of me, have
the fire of his wicked passions aroused, and then my fate would
be sealed.</p>
          <p>I determined to hide in the cabin, to pray there, in the room
that had been hallowed by the presence of God's angel of
Death; but there, cowering on the old brick hearth, like a hen
with her brood of chickens, I found, to my surprise, Amy, with
<pb id="browne172" n="172"/>
little Ben in her arms, and the two girls crouched close to her
side, evidently feeling that her presence was sufficient to protect
them.</p>
          <p>“Lor', Ann,” said Amy, her wide eyes stretched to their
utmost tension, “thar is a trader talkin' wid Masser; I won'er
whose gwine to be sole. I hope tain't us.”</p>
          <p>I didn't dare reply to her. I feared for myself, and I feared
for her.</p>
          <p>Kneeling down in the corner of the cabin, I besought mercy
of the All-merciful; but somehow, my prayers fell back cold
upon my heart. God seemed a great way off, and I could not
realize the presence of angels. “Oh,” I cried, “for the uplifting
faith that hath so often blest me! oh for the hopefulness,
the trustingness of times past! Why, why is the gate of heaven
shut against me? Why am I thus self-bound? Oh, for a wider,
broader and more liberal view! But I could not pray. Great
God! had that last and only soul-stay been taken from me?
With a black hopelessness gathering at my heart, I arose from
my knees, and looked round upon those desolate orphans,
shrinking terror-stricken, hiding away from the merciless pursuit
of a giant; and then I bethought me of my own desolation, and
I almost arraigned the justice of Heaven. Most wise Father!
pardon me! Thou, who wast tempted by Satan, and to whom
the cup of mortality was bitter, pity me and forgive!</p>
          <p>Turning away from the presence of those pleading children
I entered the kitchen, and there were Jake and Dan, terror
written on their strong, hard faces; for, no matter how hard is
the negro's present master, he always regards a change of owners
as entailing new dangers; and no wonder that, from education
and experience, he is thus suspicious, for so many troubles have
come and do come upon him, that he cannot imagine a change
whereby he is to be benefited.</p>
          <p>“Has you hearn anything, Ann?” asked Dan, with his great
flabby lips hanging loosely open, and his eyes considerably
distended.</p>
          <p>“Nothing.”</p>
          <pb id="browne173" n="173"/>
          <p>“Who's gwine to be sole?” asked Jake.</p>
          <p>“I don't know?”</p>
          <p>“Hope tisn't me.”</p>
          <p>“And hope tisn't me,” burst from the lips of both of them, and
to this my heart gave a fervent though silent echo.</p>
          <p>“He is de one dat's bought Lindy,” said old Nace, who now
entered, “and Masser's gwine to sell some de rest ob yer.”</p>
          <p>“Why do yer say de rest ob yer? Why mayn't it be you?”
asked Dan.</p>
          <p>“Bekase he ain't gwine to sell me, ha! ha! I sarved him too
long fur dat.”</p>
          <p>Ginsy and Sally came rushing in, frightened, like all the rest,
exclaiming,</p>
          <p>“Oh, we's in danger; a nigger-trader is talkin' wid master.”</p>
          <p>We had no time for prolonged speculation, for the voice of
Mr. Peterkin was heard in the entry, and, throwing open the
door, he entered, followed by Tompkins.</p>
          <p>“Here's the gang, and a devilish good-lookin' set they is.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but let me fust see the one I have bought.”</p>
          <p>“Here, Nace,” said master, “take this key, and tell Lindy to
dress herself and come here.” The last part of this sentence
was said in an under-tone.</p>
          <p>In terror I fled from the kitchen. Scarcely knowing what I
did, I rushed into the young ladies' room, into which Nace had
conducted Lindy, upon whom they were placing some of their
old finery. A half-worn calico dress, gingham apron and white
collar, completed the costume. I never shall forget the expression
of Lindy's face, as she looked vacantly around her, hunting
for sympathy, yet finding none, from the cold, haughty faces
that gazed upon her.</p>
          <p>“Now go,” said Miss Jane, “and try to behave yourself in
your new home.”</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Miss Jane,” said the humbled, weeping negro.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye,” was coldly answered; but no hand was extended
to her.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Miss Tildy.”</p>
          <pb id="browne174" n="174"/>
          <p>Miss Tildy, who was standing at the glass arranging her
hair, never turned round to look upon the poor wretch, but
carelessly said,</p>
          <p>“Good-bye.”</p>
          <p>She looked toward me; her lip was quivering and tears were
rolling down her cheeks. I turned my head away, and she
walked off with the farewell unspoken.</p>
          <p>Quickly I heard Jake calling for me. Then I knew that my
worst fears were on the point of realization. With a timid,
hesitating step, I walked to the kitchen. There, ranged in single
file, stood the servants, with anxious faces, where a variety of
contending feelings were written. I nerved myself for what I
knew was to follow, and stepping firmly up, joined the
phalanx.</p>
          <p>“That's the one,” said Tompkins, as he eyed me with that
<hi rend="italics">same</hi> look. There he stood, twirling a heavy bunch of seals which
depended from a large, curiously-wrought chain. He looked
more like a fiend than a <hi rend="italics">man</hi>.</p>
          <p>“This here one is your'n,” said Mr. Peterkin, pointing to
Lindy; “and, gal, that gentleman is yer master.”</p>
          <p>Lindy dropped a courtesy to him, and tried to wipe away her
tears; for experience had taught her that the only safe course
was to stifle emotions.</p>
          <p>“Here, gal, open yer mouth,” Tompkins said to Lindy. She
obeyed.</p>
          <p>“Now let me feel yer arms.”</p>
          <p>He then examined her feet, ankles, legs, passed his hands over
various parts of her body, made her walk and move her limbs
in different ways, and then, seemingly satisfied with the bargain,
said,</p>
          <p>“Wal, that trade is closed.”</p>
          <p>Looking toward me, his dissolute eyes began to glare furiously.
Again my soul quailed; but I tried to govern myself,
and threw upon him a glance as cold as ice itself.</p>
          <p>“What will you take for this yallow gal?” he said, as he laid
his hand upon my shoulder. I shrank beneath his touch; yet
<pb id="browne175" n="175"/>
resistance would only have made the case worse, and I was
compelled to submit.</p>
          <p>“I ain't much anxious to sell her; she is my darter Jane's
waitin' 'ooman, and, you see, my darters are putty much stuck
up. They thinks they must have a waitin'-maid; but, if you
offer a far price, maybe we will close in.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, as she is a fancy article, I'll jist say take twelve
hundred dollars, and that's more an' she's actilly worth; but I
wants her fur my <hi rend="italics">own use</hi>; a sorter private gal like, you knows,”
and he gave a lascivious blink, which Mr. Peterkin seemed to
understand. I felt a deep crimson suffuse my face. Oh, God!
this was the heaviest of all afflictions. <hi rend="italics">Sold</hi>! and for <hi rend="italics">such a
purpose</hi>!</p>
          <p>“I reckon the bargain is closed, then,” said Mr. Peterkin.</p>
          <p>I felt despair coiling around my heart. Yet I knew that to
make an appeal to their humanity would be worse than idle.</p>
          <p>“Who, which of them have you sold, father?” asked Miss
Jane, who entered the kitchen, doubtless for the humane object
of witnessing the distress of the poor creatures.</p>
          <p>“Wal, Lindy's sold, and we are 'bout closing the bargain
for Ann.”</p>
          <p>“Why, Ann belongs to me.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but Tompkins offers twelve hundred dollars; and six
hundred of it you shill have to git new furniture.”</p>
          <p>“She shan't go for six thousand. I want an accomplished
maid when I go up to the city, and she just suits me.
Remember I have your deed of gift.”</p>
          <p>This relieved me greatly, for I understood her determination;
and, though I knew all sorts of severity would be exercised
over me in my present home, I felt assured that my honor
would remain unstained.</p>
          <p>The trader tried to persuade and coax Miss Jane; but she
remained impervious to all of his importunities.</p>
          <p>“Wal, then,” he said, after finding she would yield to no
argument, “haven't you none others you can let me have? I
am 'bliged to fill up my lot.”</p>
          <pb id="browne176" n="176"/>
          <p>“Wal, since my darter won't trade nohow, I must try and
let you have some of the others, though I don't care much
'bout sellin'.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin was what was called tight on a trade; now,
though he was anxious enough to sell, he affected to be perfectly
indifferent. This was what would be termed an excellent <foreign lang="fre">ruse
de guerre</foreign>.</p>
          <p>“If you want children, I think we can supply you,” said
Miss Jane, and, looking round, she asked,</p>
          <p>“Where are Amy and her sisters?”</p>
          <p>My heart sank within me, and, though I knew full well
where they were, I would not speak.</p>
          <p>Little Jim, the son of Ginsy, cried out,</p>
          <p>“Yes, I know where dey is. I seed em in dar.”</p>
          <p>“Well, run you young rascal, and tell 'em to come here in a
minnit,” said Mr. Peterkin; and away the boy scampered. In
a few moments he returned, followed by Amy, who was bearing
Ben in her arms; and, holding on to her skirts, were the
two girls, terror limned on their dark, shining faces.</p>
          <p>“Step up here to this gentleman, Amy, and say how would
you like him for a master?” said Mr. Peterkin.</p>
          <p>“Please, sir,” replied Amy, “I don't kere whar I goes, so I
takes these chillen wid me.”</p>
          <p>“I do not want Amy to be sold. Sell the children, father;
but let us keep Amy for a house-girl.” Cold and unfeeling
looked the lady as she pronounced these words; but could
you have seen the expression of Amy's face! There is no
human language, no painter's power, to show forth the eye of
frantic madness with which the girl glared around on all.
Clutching little Ben tightly, savagely to her bosom, she said no
word, and all seemed struck by the extreme wildness of her
manner.</p>
          <p>“Let's look at that boy,” said the trader, as he attempted to
unfasten Amy's arms but were locked round her treasure.</p>
          <p>“Dont'ee, dont'ee,” shrieked the child.</p>
          <p>“Yes, but he will,” said Mr. Peterkin, as, with a giant's
<pb id="browne177" n="177"/>
force, he broke asunder the slight arms, “you imperdent hussy,
arn't you my property? mine to do what I pleases with; and
do you dar' to oppose me?”</p>
          <p>The girl said nothing; but the wild expression began to grow
wilder, fiercer, and more frightful. Little Ben, who was not
accustomed to any kind of notice, and felt at home nowhere
except in Amy's arms, set up a furious scream; but this the
trader did not mind, and proceeded to examine the limbs.</p>
          <p>“Something is the matter with this boy, he's got hip-disease;
I knows from his teeth he is older than you says.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said Amy seizing the idea, “he is weakly, he won't
do no good widout me; buy me too, please, Masser,” and she
crouched down at the trader's feet, with her hands thrown up in
an air of touching supplication; but she had gone to the wrong
tribunal for mercy. Who can hope to find so fair a flower
blooming amid the dreary brambles of a negro-trader's breast?</p>
          <p>Tompkins took no other notice of her than to give her a
contemptuous kick, as much as to say, “thing, get out of my way.”</p>
          <p>Turning to Mr. Peterkin he said,</p>
          <p>“This boy is not sound. I won't have him at any price,”
and he handed him back to Amy, who exclaimed, in a thrilling
tone,</p>
          <p>“Thank God! Bless you, Masser!” and she clasped the shy
little Ben warmly to her breast.</p>
          <p>Ben, whose intellect seemed clouded, looked wonderingly
around on the group; then, as if slowly realizing that he had
escaped a mighty trouble, clung closer to Amy.</p>
          <p>“Look here, nigger-wench, does you think to spile the sale
of property in that ar' way? Wal, I'll let you see I'll have
things my way. No nigger that ever was born, shall dictate
to me.”</p>
          <p>“No, father, I'd punish her well, even if I had to give Ben
away; he is no account here, merely an expense; and do sell
those other two girls, Amy's sisters.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin then called up Lucy and Janey. I have mentioned
these two but rarely in the progress of this book, and for
<pb id="browne178" n="178"/>
the reason that their little lives were not much interwoven with
the thread of mine. I saw them often, but observed nothing
particular about them. They were quiet, taciturn, and what is
usually called stupid children. They, like little Ben, never
ventured far away from Amy's protecting wing. Now, with a
shy step and furtive glance toward the trader, they obeyed
their master's summons. Poor Amy, with Ben clasped to her
'heart, strained her body forward, and looked with stretched
eyes and suspended breath toward Tompkins, who was
examining them.</p>
          <p>“Wal, I'll give you three hundred and fifty a-piece for 'em.
Now, come, that's the highest I'll give, Peterkin, and you
mustn't try to git any more out of me. You are a hard customer;
but I am in a hurry, so I makes my largest offer right
away: I ain't got the time to waste. That's more 'an anybody
else would give for 'em; but I sees that they has good fingers
fur to pick cotton, therefore I gives a big price.”</p>
          <p>“It's a bargain, then. They is yourn;” and no doubt Mr.
Peterkin thought he had a good bargain, or he never would
have chewed his tobacco in that peculiarly self-satisfied
manner.</p>
          <p>“Stand aside, then,” said the trader, pushing his new purchases,
as if they were a bundle of dry goods. Running up to
Amy, they began to hold to her skirts and tremble violently,
scarcely knowing what the words of Tompkins implied.</p>
          <p>“Dey ain't sold?” asked Amy, turning first from one to the
other; yet no one answered. Mr. Peterkin and Tompkins
were too busy with their trade, and the negroes too much
absorbed in their own fate, to attend to her. For my part I had
not strength to confirm her half-formed doubt. There she
stood, gathering them to her side with a motherly love.</p>
          <p>“What will you give fur this one?” and Mr. Peterkin pointed
to Ginsy, who stood with an humble countenance. When
called up she made a low courtesy, and went through the
examination. Name and age were given; a fair price was offered
for her and her child, and was accepted.</p>
          <pb id="browne179" n="179"/>
          <p>“Take this boy for a hundred dollars,” said Mr. Peterkin, as
he jerked Ben from the arms of the half-petrified Amy.</p>
          <p>“Wal, he isn't much 'count; but, rather then seem contrary,
I'll give that fur him.”</p>
          <p>And thus the trade was closed. Human beings were disposed
of with as little feeling as if they had been wild animals.</p>
          <p>“I'm sorry you won't, young Miss, let me have that maid of
yourn, but I'll be 'long next fall, and, fur a good price, I 'spect
you'll be willin' to trade. I wants that yallow wench,” and he
clicked his fingers at me.</p>
          <p>“Say, Peterkin, ken you lend me a wagen to take 'em over
to my pen?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes; and Nace can drive 'em over.”</p>
          <p>Conscious of having got a good price, Mr. Peterkin was in a
capital humor.</p>
          <p>“Come, go with me, Peterkin, and we'll draw up the papers,
and I'll pay you your money.”</p>
          <p>This was an agreeable sound to master. He ordered Nace to
bring out the wagon, and the order was hardly given before it
was obeyed. Dismal looked that red wagon, the same which
years before had carried me away from the insensible form of
my broken-hearted mother. It appeared more dark and dreary,
to me, than a coffin or hearse.</p>
          <p>“Say, Peterkin, don't let 'em take many close; jist a
change. It tires 'em too much if they have big bundles to
carry.”</p>
          <p>“They shan't be troubled with that.”</p>
          <p>“Now, niggers, git your bundles and come 'long,” said
master.</p>
          <p>“Oh,” cried Lindy, “can I git to see young master before I
start? I wants to thank him for de comfort he gib me last
night,” and she wiped the tears from her eyes, and was start-
ing toward the door of the house, when Miss Jane intercepted
her.</p>
          <p>“No, you runaway hussy, you shan't go in to disturb him,
and have a scene here.”</p>
          <pb id="browne180" n="180"/>
          <p>“Please, Miss Jane, I only wants to say good-bye.”</p>
          <p>“You shan't do it.”</p>
          <p>Mournfully, and with the tears streaming far down her
cheeks, she turned to me, saying, “Please, you, Ann, tell him
good-bye fur me, and good-bye to you. I hope you will forgive
me for all de harm I has done to you.”</p>
          <p>I took her hand, but could not speak a word. Silently I
pressed it.</p>
          <p>“Whar's your close, gal?” asked Tompkins.</p>
          <p>“I'm gwine to git 'em.”</p>
          <p>“Well, be in a hurry 'bout it.”</p>
          <p>She went off to gather up a few articles, scarcely sufficient
to cover her; for we were barely allowed a change of clothing,
and that not very decent.</p>
          <p>Ginsy, leading her child with one hand, while she held in the
other a small bundle, walked up to Miss Jane, and dropping a
low courtesy, said,</p>
          <p>“Farewell, Miss Jane; can I see Miss Tildy and young
master?”</p>
          <p>“No, John is sick, and Tildy can't be troubled just now.</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'm; Please tell 'em good-bye fur me; and I hopes
young Masser will soon be well agin. I'd like to see him afore
I went, but I don't want to 'sturb him.”</p>
          <p>“Well, that will do, go on now.</p>
          <p>“Tell young Masser good-bye,” Ginsy said, addressing her
child.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye,” repeated Miss Jane very carelessly, scarcely
looking toward them, and they moved away, and shaking hands
with the servants, they marched on to the wagon.</p>
          <p>All this time Amy had remained like one transfixed; little
Ben held one of her hands, whilst Janey and Luce grasped her
skirts firmly. These children had no clothes, for, as they performed
no regular labor, they were not allowed a change of apparel.
On a Saturday night, whilst they slept, Amy washed
out the articles which they had worn during the week; and
now, poor things, they had no bundles to be made up.</p>
          <pb id="browne181" n="181"/>
          <p>Come 'long wid yer, young ones,” and Tompkins took
Ben by the hand; but he stoutly refused to go, crying out</p>
          <p>“Go 'way, and let me 'lone.”</p>
          <p>“Come on, I'll give you a lump of sugar.”</p>
          <p>“I won't, I won't.”</p>
          <p>All of them held tightly to Amy, whose vacant face was so
stony in its deep despair, that it struck terror to my soul.</p>
          <p>“No more fuss,” said Mr. Peterkin, and he raised his large
whip to strike the screaming Ben a blow; but that motherly
instinct that had taught Amy to protect them thus long, was
not now dead, and upon her outstretched arm the blow descended.
A great, fearful gash was made, from which the fresh blood
streamed rapidly; but she minded it not. What, to that
lightning-burnt soul, were the wounds of the body ? Nothing, aye
nothing!</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't mark 'em, Peterkin, it will spile the sale,” said
Tompkins.</p>
          <p>“Come 'long now, niggers, I has no more time to wait;”
and, with a strong wrench, he broke Ben's arms loose from
Amy's form, and, holding him firmly, despite his piteous cries,
he ordered Jake to bring the other two also. This order was
executed, and quickly Luce and Janey were in the grasp of
Jake, and borne shrieking to the cart, in which all three of
them were bound and laid.</p>
          <p>Speechless, stony, petrified, stood Amy. At length, as if
gifted with a supernatural energy, she leaped forward, as the
cart drove off, and fell across the path, almost under the feet
of the advancing horses. But not yet for thee, poor suffering
child, will come the Angel of Death! It has been decreed that
you shall endure and wait a while longer.</p>
          <p>By an adroit check upon the rein, Nace stopped the wagon
suddenly, and Jake, who was standing near by, lifted Amy up.
“Take her to the house, and see that she does herself no
harm,” said Mr. Peterkin.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Masser, I will,” was the reply of the obsequious Jake.</p>
          <p>And so the cart drove on. I shall never forget the sight!
<pb id="browne182" n="182"/>
Those poor, down-cast creatures, tied hand and foot, were
conveyed they knew not whither. The shrieks. and screams of
those children ring now in my ears. Oh, doleful, most doleful!
Why came there no swift execution of that Divine threat,
“Whoso causeth harm to one of these little ones, it were better
for him that a mill-stone were hung about his neck and that
he were drowned in the sea.”</p>

            <p>TOUCHING FAREWELL FULL OF PATHOS—THE PARTING—MY
GRIEF.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE half insensible form of Amy was borne by Jake into
the cabin, and laid upon the cot which had been Aunt Polly's.
He then closed and secured the door after him.</p>
          <p>Where, all this time, was Miss Bradly? She, in her terror,
had buried her head upon the bed, on which young master still
slept. She tried to drown the sound of those frantic cries that
reached her, despite the closed door and barred shutter. Oh,
did they not reach the ear of Almighty love?</p>
          <p>“Well, I am glad,” exclaimed Miss Tildy, “that it is all over.
Somehow, Jane, I did not like the sound of those young
children's cries. Might it not have been well to let Amy go
too?”</p>
          <p>“No, of course not. Now that Lindy has been sold, we
need a house-girl, and Amy may be made a very good one;
besides, she enraged me so by attempting to spoil the sale of
Ben.”</p>
          <p>“Did she do that? Oh, well, I have no pity for her.”</p>
          <p>“It would be something very new, Till, for you to pity a
nigger.”</p>
          <p>“So it would—yet I was weak enough to feel badly when I
heard the children scream.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, you are only nervous.”</p>
          <p>“I believe I am, and think I will take some medicine.”</p>
          <p>“Take medicine,” to stifle human pity!</p>
          <p>“What rhubarb, senna, or what purgative drug would scour”
the slaveholder's nature of harshness and brutality? Could
<pb id="browne184" n="184"/>
this be found, “I would applaud to the very echo, that should
applaud again;” but, alas! there is no remedy for it. Education
has taught many of them to guard their “beloved institution”
with a sort of patriotic fervor and religious zeal.</p>
          <p>When master returned that evening, he was elated to a
wonderful degree. Tompkins had paid him a large sum in ready
cash, and this put him in a good humor with himself and
everybody else. He almost felt kindly toward the negroes. But I
looked upon him with more than my usual horror. That great,
bloated face, blazing now with joy and the effect of strong
drink, was revolting to me. Every expression of delight from
his lips brought to my mind the horrid troubles he had caused
by the simple exercise of his tyrannic will upon helpless women
and children. The humble appearance of Ginsy, the touching
innocence of her child, the unnoticed silent grief of Lindy,
the fearful, heart-rending distraction of Amy, the agony of
her helpless sisters and brother, all rose to my mind when
I heard Mr. Peterkin's mirthful laugh ringing through the
house.</p>
          <p>Late in the evening young master roused up. The effect of
the somnolent draught had died out, and he woke in full
possession of his faculties. Miss Bradly and I were with him when
he woke. Raising himself quickly in the bed, he asked,</p>
          <p>“What hour is it?”</p>
          <p>“About half-past six,” said Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>“So late? Then am I afraid that all is over! Where is
Lindy?”</p>
          <p>“Try and rest a little more; then we can talk!”</p>
          <p>“No, I must know <hi rend="italics">now</hi>.”</p>
          <p>“Wait a while longer.”</p>
          <p>“Tell me instantly,” he said with a nervous impatience very
unusual to him.</p>
          <p>“Drink this, and I will then talk to you,” said Miss Bradly,
as she held a cordial to his lips.</p>
          <p>Obediently he swallowed it, and, as he returned the glass, he
asked,</p>
          <pb id="browne185" n="185"/>
          <p>“How has this wretched matter terminated? What has
become of that unfortunate girl?”</p>
          <p>“She has been sold.”</p>
          <p>“To the trader?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but don't talk about it; perhaps she is better off than
we think.”</p>
          <p>“Is it wise for us thus to silence our sympathies?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, it is, when we are powerless to act.”</p>
          <p>“But have we not, each of us, an influence?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but in such a dubious way, that in cases like the present,
we had better not openly manifest it.”</p>
          <p>“Offensive we should never be; but surely we ought to
assume a defensive position.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but you must not excite yourself.”</p>
          <p>“Don't think of me. Already I fear I am too self-indulged.
Too much time I have wasted in inaction.”</p>
          <p>“What could you have done? And now what can you do?”</p>
          <p>“That is the very question that agitates me. Oh, that I
knew my mission, and had the power to fulfil it!”</p>
          <p>“Who of the others are sold?” he asked, turning to me.</p>
          <p>“Amy's sisters and brother,” and I could not avoid tears.</p>
          <p>“Amy, too?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, God, this is too bad! and is she not half-distracted?”</p>
          <p>I made no reply, for an admonitory look from Miss Bradly
warned me to be careful as to what I said.</p>
          <p>“Where is father?”</p>
          <p>“In his chamber.”</p>
          <p>“Ann, go tell him I wish to speak with him.”</p>
          <p>Before obeying I looked toward Miss Bradly, and, finding
nothing adverse in her expression, I went to do as he bade.</p>
          <p>“Is he any worse?” master asked, when I had delivered the
message.</p>
          <p>“No, sir; he does not appear to be worse, yet I think he is
very feeble.”</p>
          <p>“What right has you to think anything 'bout it?” he said, as
<pb id="browne186" n="186"/>
he took from the mantle a large, black bottle and drank
from it.</p>
          <p>I made no reply, but followed him into young master's room,
and pretended to busy myself about some trifling matter.</p>
          <p>“What is it you want, Johnny?”</p>
          <p>“Father, you have done a wicked thing!”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean, boy?”</p>
          <p>“You have sold Amy's sisters and brothers away from her.”</p>
          <p>“And what's wicked in selling a nigger?”</p>
          <p>“Hasn't a negro human feeling?”</p>
          <p>“Why, they don't feel like white people; of course not.”</p>
          <p>“That must be proved, father.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, now, my boy, 'taint no use for yer to be wastin' of yer
good feelin's on them miserable, ongrateful niggers.”</p>
          <p>“They are not ungrateful; miserable they are, for they have
had much misery imposed upon them.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, 'taint no use of talking 'bout it, child, go to sleep.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, father, I shall soon sleep soundly enough, in our
grave-yard.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin moved nervously in his chair, and young master
continued,</p>
          <p>“I do not wish to live longer. I can do no good here, and
the sight of so much misery only makes me more wretched.
Father, draw close to me, I have lost a great deal of blood.
My chest and throat are very sore. I feel that the tide of life
ebbs low. I am going fast. My little hour upon earth is almost
spent. Ere long, the great mystery of existence will be
known to me. A cold shadow, with death-dews on its form,
hovers round me. I know, by many signs unknown to others,
that death is now upon me. This difficult and labored speech,
this failing breath and filmy eye, these heavy night-sweats—all
tell me that the golden bowl is about to be broken: the silver
cord is tightened to its utmost tension. I am young, father; I
have forborne to speak to you upon a subject that has lain near,
near, very near my heart.” A violent paroxysm of coughing
here interrupted him. Instantly Miss Bradly was beside him
<pb id="browne187" n="187"/>
with a cordial, which he drank mechanically. “There,” he
continued, as he poised himself upon his elbow, there, good
Miss Emily, cordials are of no avail. I do not wish to stay.
Father, do you not want me to rest quietly in my grave?”</p>
          <p>“I don't want you to go to the grave at all, my boy, my
boy”, and Mr. Peterkin burst into tears.</p>
          <p>“Yes, but, father, I am going there fast, and no human power
can stay me. I shall be happy and resigned, if I can elicit from
you one promise.”</p>
          <p>“What promise is that?”</p>
          <p>“Liberate your slaves.”</p>
          <p>“Never!”</p>
          <p>“Look at me, father.”</p>
          <p>“Good God!” cried Mr. Peterkin, as his eye met the calm,
clear, fixed gaze of his son, “where did you get that look? heaven
and h—l! it will kill me;” and, rushing from the room, he
sought his own apartment, where he drank long and deeply from
the black bottle that graced his mantel-shelf. This was his
drop of comfort. Always after lashing a negro, he drank plentifully,
as if to drown his conscience. Alas! many another man
has sought relief from memory by such libations! Yet these
are the voters, the noblesse, the lords so superior to the lowly
African. These are the men who vote for a perpetuation of our
captivity. Can we hope for a mitigation of our wrongs when
such men are our sovereigns? Cool, clear-visioned men are
few, noble philanthropic ones are fewer. What then have we
to hope for? Our interests are at war with old established
usages. The prejudices of society are against us. The pride
of the many is adverse to us. All this we have to fight against;
and strong must be the moral force that can overcome it.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin did not venture in young master's room for
several hours after; and not without having been sent for
repeatedly. Meanwhile I sought Amy, and found her lying
on the floor of the cabin, with her face downwards. She did
not move when I entered, nor did she answer me when I
<pb id="browne188" n="188"/>
spoke. I lifted her up, but the hard, stony expression of her
face, frightened me.</p>
          <p>“Amy, I will be your friend.”</p>
          <p>“I don't want any friend.”</p>
          <p>“Yes you do, you like me.”</p>
          <p>“No I don't, I doesn't like anybody.”</p>
          <p>“Amy, God loves you.”</p>
          <p>“I doesn't love Him.”</p>
          <p>“Don't talk that way, child.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you go off, and let me 'lone.”</p>
          <p>“I wish to comfort you.”</p>
          <p>“I doesn't want no comfort.”</p>
          <p>“Come,” said I, “talk freely to me. It will do you good.”</p>
          <p>“I tells you I doesn't want no good for to happen to me.
I'd rather be like I is.”</p>
          <p>“Amy,” and it was with reluctance I ventured to allude
to a subject so painful; but I deemed it necessary to excite
her painfully rather than leave her in that granite-like despair,
“you may yet have your sisters and little brother restored to
you.”</p>
          <p>“How? how? and when?” she screamed with joy, and
started up, her wild eyes beaming with exultation.</p>
          <p>“Don't be so wild,” I said, softly, as I took her little, hard
hand, and pressed it tenderly.</p>
          <p>“But, say, Ann, ken I iver git de chilen back? Has
Masser said anything 'bout it? Oh, it 'pears like too much
joy fur me to iver know any more. Poor little Ben, it
'pears like I kan't do nothin' but hear him cry. And maybe
dey is a beatin' of him now. Oh, Lor' a marcy! what
shill I do?” and she rocked her body back and forward in a
transport of grief.</p>
          <p>There are some sorrows for which human sympathy is unavailing.
What to that broken heart were words of condolence?
Did she care to know that others felt for her? that another
heart wept for her grief? No, like Rachel of old, she would
not be comforted.</p>
          <pb id="browne189" n="189"/>
          <p>“Oh, Ann!” she added, “please leave me by myself. It
'pears like I kan't get my breath when anybody is by me. I
wants to be by myself. Jist let me 'lone for a little while, then
I'll talk to you.”</p>
          <p>I understood the feeling, and complied with her request.</p>
          <p>The slave is so distrustful of sympathy, he is so accustomed
to deception, that he feels secure in the indulgence of his
grief only when he is alone. The petted white, who has friends
to cluster round him in the hour of affliction, cannot understand
the loneliness and solitude which the slave covets as a boon.</p>
          <p>For several days young master lingered on, declining visibly.
The hectic flush deepened upon his cheek, and the glitter of
his eye grew fearfully bright, and there was that sharp
contraction of his features that denoted the certain approach of
death. His cough became low and even harder, and those
dreadful night-sweats increased. He lay in a stupid state, half
insensible from the effects of sedatives. Dr. Mandy, who visited
him three times a day, did not conceal from Mr. Peterkin the
fact of his son's near dissolution.</p>
          <p>“Save his life, doctor, and you shall have all I own.”</p>
          <p>“If my art could do it, sir, I would, without fee, exert myself
for his restoration.”</p>
          <p>Yet for a poor old negro his art could do nothing unfeed. Do
ye wonder that we are goaded on to acts of desperation, when
every day, nay, every moment, brings to our eyes some injustice
that is done us—and all because our faces are dark.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Mislike us not for our complexion,</l>
            <l>The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,</l>
            <l>To whom we are as neighbors, and near bred;</l>
            <l>Bring us the fairest creature Northward born,</l>

          </lg>
          <p>During young master's illness I had but little communication
with Amy. By Miss Jane's order she had been brought into
<pb id="browne190" n="190"/>
the house to assist in the dining-room. I gave her all the
instruction in my power. She appeared to listen to me, and
learned well; yet everything was done with that vacant,
unmeaning manner, that showed she felt no interest in what she
was doing. I had never heard her allude to “the children<corr sic="'">”</corr>
since the conversation just recorded. Indeed, she appeared to
eschew all talk. At night I had attempted to draw her into
conversation, but she always silenced me by saying,</p>
          <p>“I'm tired, Ann, and wants to sleep.”</p>
          <p>This was singular in one so young, who had been reared in
such a reckless manner. I should have been better satisfied if
she had talked more freely of her sorrows; that stony, silent
agony that seemed frozen upon her face, terrified me more
than the most volcanic grief; that sorrow is deeply-rooted and
hopeless, that denies itself the relief of speech. Heaven help
the soul thus cut off from the usual sources of comfort. Oh,
young Miss, spoiled daughter of wealth, you whose earliest
breath opened to the splendors of home in its most luxurious
form; you who have early and long known the watchful blessing
of maternal love, and whose soft check has flushed to the
praises of a proud and happy father, whose lip has thrilled
beneath the pressure of a brother's kiss; you who have slept
upon the sunny slope of life, have strayed 'mid the flowers, and
reposed beneath the myrtles, and beside the fountains, where
fairy fingers have garlanded flowers for your brow, oh, bethink
you of some poor little negro girl, whom you often meet in your
daily walks, whose sad face and dejected air you have often
condemned as sullen, and I ask you now, in the name of sweet
humanity, to judge her kindly. Look, with a pitying eye, upon
that face which trouble has soured and abuse contracted. Repress
the harsh word; give her kindness; 'tis this that she longs
for. Be you the giver of the cup of cold water in His name.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>A CONVERSATION—HOPE BLOSSOMS OUT, BUT CHARLESTOWN IS FULL OF EXCITABILITY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ONE evening, during young master's illness, when he was
able to sit up beside the fire, Dr. Mandy came to see him, and,
as I sat in his room, sewing on some fancy work for Miss Jane,
I heard the conversation that passed between them.</p>
          <p>“Have you coughed much?” the doctor asked.</p>
          <p>“A great deal last night.”</p>
          <p>“Do the night-sweats continue?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir, and are violent.”</p>
          <p>“Let me feel your pulse. Here—it is very quick—face is
flushed—high fever.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, doctor, I am sinking fast.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, keep up your spirits. I have been thinking that the
best thing for you would be to take a trip to Havana. This
climate is too variable for your complaint.”</p>
          <p>Young master shook his head mournfully.</p>
          <p>“The change of scene,” the doctor went on, “would be of
service to you. A healthful excitement of the imagination, and a
different train of thought, would, undoubtedly, benefit you.”</p>
          <p>“What in the South could induce a different train of
thought? Oh, doctor, the horrid system, that there flourishes
with such rank power, would only deepen my train of thought,
and make me more wretched than I am; I would not go near
New Orleans, or pass those dreadful plantations, even to secure
the precious boon of health.”</p>
          <p>“You will not see anything of the kind. You will only see
life at hotels; and there the slaves are all happy and well used.
Besides, my good boy, the negroes on the plantations are much
better used than you think; and I assure you they are very
<pb id="browne192" n="192"/>
happy. If you could overhear them laughing and singing of
an evening, you would be convinced that they are well cared
for.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, disguise thee as thou wilt, yet, Slavery, thou art horrid
and revolting.”</p>
          <p>“You are morbid on the subject.”</p>
          <p>“No, only humane; but have I not seen enough to make me
morbid?”</p>
          <p>“These are subjects upon which I deem it best to say
nothing.”</p>
          <p>“That is the invariable argument of self-interest.”</p>
          <p>“No, of prudence, Mr. John; I have no right to quarrel with
and rail out against an institution that has the sanction of the
law, and which is acceptable to the interests of my best friends
and patrons.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Exactly; the whole matter, so vital to the happiness of
others, so fraught with great humanitarian interests, must be
quietly laid on the shelf, because it may lose you or me a few
hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“Not precisely that either; but, granting, for the sake of
hypothesis only, that slavery is a wrong, what good would all my
arguments do? None, but rather an injury to the very cause
they sought to benefit. You must not exasperate the slave-holders.
Leave them to time and their own reflections. I believe
many of the Western States—yes, Kentucky herself—
would at this moment be free from slavery, if it had not been
for the officious interference of the North. The people of the
West and South are hot, fiery and impetuous. They may be
persuaded and coaxed into a measure, but never driven. All
this talk and gasconade of Abolitionists have but the tighter
bound the negroes.”</p>
          <p>“I am sorry to hear you thus express yourself, for you give
me a more contemptible opinion of the Southern and Western
men, or rather the slave-holding class, than I had before. And
so they are but children, who must be coaxed, begged, and be
sugar-plumed into doing a simple act of justice. Have they
<pb id="browne193" n="193"/>
not the manhood to come out boldly, and say this thing is
wrong, and that they will no longer countenance it in their
midst; that they will, for the sake of justice and sympathy with
humanity, liberate these creatures, whom they have held in an
unjust and wicked bondage? Were they to act thus, then
might they claim for themselves the title of chevaliers.”</p>
          <p>“Yes; but they take a different view of the subject; they
look upon slavery as just and right—a dispensation of
Providence, and feel that they are as much entitled to their slaves as
another man is to his house, carriage, or horse.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, how they shut their hearts against the voice of misery,
and close their eyes to the rueful sigh of human grief. I never
heard a pro-slavery man who could, upon any reasonable
ground, defend his position. The slavery argument is not only
a wicked, but an absurd one. How wise men can be deluded
by it I am at a loss to understand. Infatuated they must be,
else they could not uphold a system as tyrannous as it is
base.”</p>
          <p>“Well, we will say no more upon this subject,” said the doctor,
as Mr. Peterkin entered.</p>
          <p>“What's the matter?” the latter inquired, as he listlessly
threw himself into a chair.</p>
          <p>“Nothing, only Mr. John is not all right on the ‘goose,’ ” replied
Dr. Mandy, with a facetious smile.</p>
          <p>“And not likely to be,” said Mr. Peterkin; “Johnny has given
me a great deal of trouble 'bout this matter; but I hope he will
outgrow it. 'Tis only a foolish notion. He was 'lowed to
gad 'bout too much with them ar' devilish niggers, an' so 'bibed
their quare ideas agin slavery. Now, in my 'pinion, my niggers
is a darned sight better off than many of them poor whites at
the North.”</p>
          <p>“But are they as free?” asked young master.</p>
          <p>“No, to be sure they is not,” and here Mr. Peterkin ejected
from his mouth an amount of tobacco-juice that nearly
extinguished the fire.</p>
          <p>“Woe be unto the man who takes from a fellow-being the
<pb id="browne194" n="194"/>
priceless right of personal liberty!” exclaimed young master,
with his fine eyes fervently raised.</p>
          <p>“Yes, but everybody don't desarve liberty. Niggers ain't fit
for to govern 'emselves nohow. They has bin too long 'customed
to havin' masters. Them that's went to Libery has bin
of no 'count to 'emselves nor nobody else. I tell yer, niggers
was made to be slaves, and yer kan't change their Creator's design.
Why, you see, doctor, a nigger's mind is never half as
good as a white man's;” and Mr. Peterkin conceived this speech
to be the very best extract of lore and sapience.</p>
          <p>“Why is not the African mind equal to the Caucasian?”
inquired young master, with that pointed naivete for which he
was so remarkable.</p>
          <p>“Oh, it tain't no use, Johnny, fur you to be talkin' that ar'
way. It's all fine enoff in newspapers, but it won't do to bring
it into practice, 'specially out here in the West.”</p>
          <p>“No, father, I begin to fear that it is of no avail to talk common
sense and preach humanity in a community like this.”</p>
          <p>“Don't talk any more on this subject,” said the doctor; “I
am afraid it does Mr. John no particular good to be so painfully
excited. I was going to propose to you, Mr. Peterkin, to send
him South, either on a little coasting trip, or to Havana <hi rend="italics">via</hi> New
Orleans. I think this climate is too rigorous and uncertain for
one of his frail constitution to remain in it during the winter.”</p>
          <p>“Well, doctor, I am perfectly willin' fur him to go, if I had
anybody to go with him; but you see it wouldn't be safe to
trust him by himself. Now an idee has jist struck me, which,
if you'll agree to, will 'zackly suit me. 'Tis for you to go 'long;
then he'd have a doctor to rinder him any sarvice he might
need. Now Docter if you'll go, I'll foot the bill, and pay you a
good bonus in the bargain.”</p>
          <p>“Well, it will be a great professional sacrifice; but I'm willing
to make it for a friend like you, and for a patient in whose
recovery or improvement I feel so deeply interested.”</p>
          <p>”Make no sacrifices for me, dear doctor; my poor wreck of
life is not worth a sacrifice; I can weather it out a little longer
<pb id="browne195" n="195"/>
in this region. It requires a stronger air than that of the tropics
to restore strength to my poor decayed lungs.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but you must not despond,” said the doctor.</p>
          <p>“No, my boy, you musn't give up. You are too young to
die. You are my only son, and I can't spare you.” Again Mr.
Peterkin turned uneasily in his chair.</p>
          <p>“But tell me, doctor,” he added, “don't you think he is
growin' stronger?”</p>
          <p>“Why, yes I do; and if he will consent to go South, I shall
have strong hope of him.”</p>
          <p>“He must consent,” exclaimed Mr. Peterkin, with a decided
emphasis.</p>
          <p>“You know my objection, doctor, yet I cannot oppose my
wish against father's judgment; so I will go, but 'twill be without
the least expectation of ever again seeing home.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't, don't, my boy,” and Mr. Peterkin's voice faltered,
and his eyes were very moist.</p>
          <p>“Idols of clay!” I thought, “how frail ye are; albeit ye are
manufactured out of humanity's finest porcelain, yet a rude
touch, a slight jar, and the beautiful fabric is destroyed forever!”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin's treasure, his only son, was wasting slowly,
inch by inch, before his eyes—dying with slow and silent
certainty. The virus was in his blood, and no human aid could
check its strides. The father looked on in speechless dread. He
saw the insidious marks of the incurable malady. He read its
ravages upon the broad white brow of his son, where the pulsing
veins lay like tightly-drawn cords; and on the hueless lip, that
was shrivelled like an autumn leaf; in the dilated pupil of that
prophet-like eye; in the fiery spot that blazed upon each hollow
check; and in the short, disturbed breathing that seemed to
come from a brazen tube; in all these he traced the omens of
that stealthy disease that robs us, like a thief in the night-time,
of our richest treasures.</p>
          <p>“Well, my boy,” began Mr. Peterkin, “you must prepare to
start in the course of a few days.”</p>
          <p>“I am ready to leave at any moment, father; and, if we do
<pb id="browne196" n="196"/>
not start very soon, I am thinking you will have to consign me
to the earth, rather than send me on a voyage pleasure-hunting.”</p>
          <p>A bright smile, though mournful as twilight's shadows, flitted
over the pale face of young master as he said this.</p>
          <p>“Why, Johnny, you are better this evening,” said Miss Bradly,
as she entered the room, rushed up to him, and began patting
him affectionately on either cheek.</p>
          <p>“Yes, I am better, good Miss Emily; but still feeble, oh so
feeble! My spirits are better, but the restless fire that burns
eternally here will give me no rest,” and he placed his hand
over his breast.</p>
          <p>“Yes, but you must quench that fire.”</p>
          <p>“Where is the draught clear and pure enough to quench a
flame so consuming?”</p>
          <p>“The dew of divine grace can do it.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but it descends not upon my dried and burnt spirit.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin turned off, and affected to take no note of this
little colloquy, whilst Doctor Mandy began to chew furiously.</p>
          <p>The fact is, the Peterkin family had begun to distrust Miss
Bradly's principles ever since the day young master administered
such a reproof to her muffled conscience; and in truth, I
believe she had half-declared her opposition to the slave system;
and they began to abate the fervor of their friendship for her.
The young ladies, indeed, kept up their friendly intercourse
with her, though with a modification of their former warmth.</p>
          <p>I fancied that Miss Bradly looked happier, now that she had
cast off disguise and stood forth in her true character. That
cloud of faltering distrust that once hung round her like a filmy
web, had been dissipated and she stood out, in full relief, with
the beautiful robe of truth draping and dignifying her nature.
Woman, when once she interests herself in the great cause of
humanity, goes to work with an ability and ardor that put to
shame the colder and slower action of man. The heart and
mind co-work, and thus a woman, as if by the dictate of inspiration,
will achieve with a single effort the mighty deed, for the
attainment of which men spend years in idle planning. Women
<pb id="browne197" n="197"/>
have done much, and may yet achieve more toward the
emancipation and enfranchisement of the world. The historic pages
glitter with the noble acts of heroic womanhood, and histories
yet unwritten will, I believe, proclaim the good which they
shall yet do. Who but the Maid of Orleans rescued her country?
Whose hand but woman's dealt the merited death-blow to one
of France's bloodiest tyrants? In all times, she has been
most loyal to the highest good. Woman has ever been brave!
She was the instrument of our redemption, and the early watcher
at the tomb of our Lord. To her heart the Saviour's doctrine
came with a special welcome message. And I now believe
that through her agency will yet come the political ransom of
the slaves! God grant it, and speed on the blessed day!</p>
          <p>I now looked upon Miss Bradly with the admiring interest
with which I used to regard her; and though I had never had
from her an explanation of the change or changes through
which she had passed since that memorable conversation
recorded in the earlier pages of this book, I felt assured from the
fact that young master had learned to love her, that all was
right at the core of her heart; and I was willing to forgive her
for the timidity and vacillation that had caused her to play the
dissembler. The memorable example of the loving but weak
Apostle Peter should teach us to look leniently upon all those
who cannot pass safely through the ordeal of human contempt,
without having their principles, or at least actions, a little
warped. Of course there are higher natures, from whose
fortitude the rack and the stake can provoke nothing but smiles;
but neither good St. Peter nor Miss Bradly were of such
material.</p>
          <p>“I am going to leave you very soon, Miss Emily.”</p>
          <p>“And where are you going, John?”</p>
          <p>“They will send me to the South. As the poor slaves say,
I'm going down the river;” and a sweet smile flitted over that
gentle face.</p>
          <p>“Who will accompany you?”</p>
          <pb id="browne198" n="198"/>
          <p>“Father wishes Doctor Mandy to go; but I fear it will be
too great a professional sacrifice.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, some one must go with you. You shall not go alone.”</p>
          <p>“I do not wish to go at all. I shall see nothing in the South
to please me. Those magnificent plantations of rice, sugar, and
cotton, those lordly palaces, embowered in orange trees, those
queenly magnolia groves, and all the thousand splendors that
cover the coast with loveliness, will but recall to my mind the
melancholy fact that slave-labor produces the whole. I shall
fancy that some poor heart-broken negro man, or some hopeless
mother or lonely wife watered those fields with tears. Oh, that
the dropping of those sad eyes had, like the sowing of the
dragon's teeth, produced a band of armed, bristling warriors,
strong enough to conquer all the tyrants and liberate the
captives!”</p>
          <p>“This can never be accomplished suddenly. It must be the
slow and gradual work of years. Like all schemes of reformation,
it moves but by inches. Wise legislators have proposed
means for the final abolition of slavery; but, though none have
been deemed practicable, I look still for the advent of the day
when the great sun shall look goldenly down upon the emancipation
of this dusky tribe, and when the word slave shall nowhere
find expression upon the lips of Christian men.”</p>
          <p>“When do you predict the advent of that millennial day?”</p>
          <p>“I fear it is far distant; yet is it pleasant to think that it will
come, no matter at how remote an epoch.”</p>
          <p>“Distant is it only because men are not thoroughly Christianized.
No man that will willingly hold his brother in bondage is
a Christian. Moreover, the day is far off in the future,
because of the ignorant pride of men. They wish to send the
poor negro away to the unknown land from whence his
ancestors were stolen. We virtually say to the Africans,
now you have cultivated and made beautiful our continent,
we have no farther use for you. You have grown up, it
is true, beneath the shadow of our trees, you were born upon
our soil, your early associations are here. Your ignorance
<pb id="browne199" n="199"/>
precludes you from the knowledge of the excellence of any other
land: yet for all this we take no care, it is our business to drive
you hence. Cross the ocean you must. Find a home in a
strange country; lay your broad shoulder to the work, and
make for yourself an interest there. What wonder is it, if
the poor, ignorant negro shakes his head mournfully, and says
“No, I would rather stay here; I am a slave, it is true, but
then I was born here, and here I will be buried. I am tightly
kept, have a master and a mistress, but then I know what this
is. Hard to endure, I grant it—but then it is known to me.
I can bear on a little longer, till death sets me free. No, this
is my native shore; here let me stay.” Their very ignorance
begets a kind of philosophy that
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Makes them rather bear those ills they have,</l><l>Than fly to others that they know not of.”</l></lg></q></p>
          <p>Now, why, I ask, have they not as much right to remain
here as we have? This is their birthplace as well as ours.
We are, likewise, descendants of foreigners. If we drive them
hence, what excuse have we for it? Our forefathers were not
the aborigines of this country. As well might the native red
men say to us: “Fly, leave the Western continent, 'tis our
home; we will not let you stay here. You have cultivated it,
now we will enjoy it. Go and labor elsewhere.” What would
we think of this? Yet such is our line of conduct toward
those poor creatures, who have toiled to adorn our homes.
Then again, we allow the Irish, Germans, and Hungarians, to
dwell among us. Why ban the African?“</p>
          <p>“These, my young friend, are questions that have puzzled
the wisest brains.”</p>
          <p>“If it entered more into the hearts, and disturbed the brains
less, it would be better for them and for the slaves.”</p>
          <p>“Now, come, Miss Emily, I'm tired of hearing you and that
boy talk all that nonsense. It's time you were both thinking
of something else. You are too old to be indulgin' of him in
<pb id="browne200" n="200"/>
that ar' stuff. It will never come to any good. Them ar' niggers
is allers gwine to be slaves, and white folks had better be
tendin' to what consarns 'emselves.”</p>
          <p>Such arguments as the foregoing were carried on every day.
Meanwhile we, who formed the subject of them, still went on in
our usual way, half-fed and half-clad, knocked and kicked like
dogs.</p>
          <p>Amy went about her assigned work, with the same hard-set
composure with which she had begun. Talking little to any
one, she tried to discharge her duties with a docility and faithfulness
very remarkable. Yet she sternly rebuked all conversation.
I made many efforts to draw her out into a free, sociable
talk, and was always told that it was not agreeable to her.</p>
          <p>I now had no companionship among those of my own color.
Aunt Polly was in the grave; Amy wrapped in the silence of
her own grief; and Sally (the successor of Aunt Polly in the
culinary department) was a sulky, ignorant woman, who did
not like to be sociable; and the men, with their beastly instincts,
were objects of aversion to me. So my days and nights
passed in even deeper gloom than I had ever before known.</p>

            <p>THE SUPPER—ITS CONSEQUENCES—LOSS OF SILVER—A LONELY NIGHT—AMY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE winter was now drawing to a close. The heavy, dreary winter,
that had hung like an incubus upon my hours, was fast drawing to an
end. Many a little, tuneful bird came chirping with the sunny days of
the waning February. Already the sunbeam had begun to give us a
hint of the spring-warmth; the ice had melted away, and the moistened
roofs of the houses began to smoke with the drying breath of the sun,
and little green pods were noticeable upon the dried branches of the
forest trees. It was on such a day, when the eye begins to look round
upon Nature, and almost expects to solve the wondrous phenomenon
of vegetation, that I was engaged arranging Miss Jane's wardrobe. I had
just done up some laces for her, and finished off a nice silk morning-dress.
She was making extensive preparations for a visit to the city of L.
The protracted rigors of the winter and her own fancied ill-health had
induced her to postpone the trip until the opening of spring.</p>
          <p>It was decided that I should accompany her as lady's maid; and the
fact is, I was desirous of any change from the wearying monotony of
my life.</p>
          <p>Young master had been absent during the whole winter. Frequent
letters from Dr. Mandy (who had accompanied him) informed the
family of his slowly-improving health; yet the doctor stated in each
communication that he was not strong enough to write a letter himself.
This alarmed me, for I knew that he must be excessively weak, if he
denied himself the gratification of writing to his family. Miss Bradly
came to
<pb id="browne202" n="202"/>
the house but seldom; and then only to inquire the news from young
master. Her principles upon the slavery question had become pretty
well known in the neighborhood; so her residence there was not the most
pleasant. <sic corr="innuendos">Inuendoes</sic>, of a most insulting character, had been thrown out,
highly prejudicial to her situation. Foul slanders were in busy circulation
about her, and she began to be a <sic corr="tabboed">taboed</sic> person. So I was not surprised
to hear her tell Miss Jane that she thought of returning to the North
early in the spring. I had never held any private conversation with her
since that memorable one; for now that her principles were known, she
was too much marked for a slave to be allowed to speak with her alone.
Her sorrowful face struck me with pity. I knew her to be one of that
time-serving kind, by whom the loss of caste and social position is
regarded as the most fell disaster.</p>
          <p>As I turned the key of Miss Jane's wardrobe, she came into the
room, with an unusually excited manner, exclaiming,</p>
          <p>“Ann, where is your Miss Tildy?”</p>
          <p>Upon my answering that I did not know, she bade me go and seek her
instantly, and say that she wished to speak with her. As I left the
room, I observed Miss Jane draw a letter from the folds of her dress.
This was hint enough. My mother-wit told me the rest.</p>
          <p>Finding Miss Tildy with a book, in a quiet corner of the parlor, I
delivered Miss Jane's message, and withdrew. The contents of Miss
Jane's letter soon became known; for it was, to her, of such an exciting
nature, that it could not be held in <sic corr="secrecy">secresy</sic>. The letter was from Mr.
<sic corr="Summerville">Sommerville</sic>, and announced that he would pay her a visit in the course
of a few days.</p>
          <p>And, for the next “few days,” the whole house was in a perfect
consternation. All hands were at work. Carpets were taken up, shaken,
and put down again with the “clean side” up. Paint was scoured,
windows were washed; the spare bedroom was re-arranged, and
adjusted in style; the French couch was overspread with Miss Tildy's
silk quilt, that had taken the prize at the Agricultural Fair; and fresh
bouquets were
<pb id="browne203" n="203"/>
collected from the green-house, and placed upon the mantel. Everything
looked very nice about the house, and in the kitchen all sorts of
culinary preparations had gone on. Cakes,
cookies, and confections had been made in abundance. As Amy
expressed it, in her quaintly comical way, “Christmas is comin' again.”
It was the first and only time since, the, departure
of “the children,” that I had heard her indulge in any of her old
drollery.</p>
          <p>At length the “day” arrived, and with it came Mr. Summerville. Whilst
he remained with us, everything went off in the way that Miss Jane
desired. There were fine dinners, with plenty of wine, roast turkey,
curry powder, desserts, &amp;c. The silver and best china had been brought out,
and Mr. Peterkin behaved himself as well as he could.
He even consented to use a silver fork, which, considering his
prejudice against the article, was quite a concession for him to make.</p>
          <p>Time sped on (as it always will do), and brought the end of
the week, and with it, the end of Mr. Summerville's visit. I thought,
from a certain softening of Miss Jane's eye, and from the length of the
parting interview, that “<hi rend="italics">matters</hi>” had been arranged between her and Mr.
Summerville. After the last <foreign lang="fre">adieu</foreign> had been given, and Miss Jane had
rubbed her eyes enough with her fine pocket-hand kerchief (or, perhaps,
in this case, it would be well to employ the suggestion of a modern author, and
say her “lachrymal,”) I say, after all was over,
and Mr. Summerville's interesting form was fairly lost in the distance,
Miss Tildy proposed that they should settle down to their usual
manner of living. Accordingly, the silver was all rubbed brightly by
Amy, whose business it was, then handed over to Miss Tildy to be
locked up in the bureau.</p>
          <p>For a few weeks matters went on with their usual dullness. Master
was still smoking his cob-pipe, kicking negroes, and
blaspheming; and Miss Jane making up little articles for the approaching
visit to the city. She and Miss Tildy sat a great deal in their own room,
talking and speculating upon the coming joys. Passing in and out, I
frequently caught fragments of
<pb id="browne204" n="204"/>
conversation that let me into many of their secrets. Thus I learned that
Miss Jane's chief object in visiting the city was to purchase a bridal
trousseau, that Mr. <sic corr="Summerville">Sommerville</sic> “had proposed,” and, of course, been
accepted. He lived in the city; so it was decided that, after the
celebration of the nuptial rite, Miss Tildy should accompany the bride
to her new home, and remain with her for several weeks.</p>
          <p>Sundry little lace caps were manufactured; handkerchiefs
embroidered; dresses made and altered; collars cut, and an immence
deal of “transfering” was done by the sisters Peterkin.</p>
          <p>We, of the “colored population,” were stinted even more than
formerly; for they deemed it expedient to economize, in order to be the
better able to meet the pecuniary exigencies of the marriage. Thus time
wore along, heavily enough for the slaves; but doubtless delightful to the
white family. The enjoyment of pleasure, like all other prerogatives,
they considered as exclusively their own.</p>
          <p>Time, in its rugged course, had brought no change to Amy. If her heart
had learned to bear its bereavement better, or had grown more tender in
its anxious waiting, we knew it not from her word or manner. The same
settled, rocky look, the same abstracted air, marked her deportment.
Never once had I heard her laugh, or seen her weep. She still avoided
conversation, and was assiduous in the discharge of her domestic duties.
If she did a piece of work well, and was praised for it, she received the
praise with the same indifferent air; or if, as was most frequently the
case, she was harshly chided and severely punished, 'twas all the same.
No tone or word could move those rigid features.</p>
          <p>One evening Miss Bradly came over to see the young ladies, and
inquire the latest, news from young master. Miss Jane gave orders that
the table should be set with great care, and all the silver displayed. They
had long since lost their olden familiarity, and, out of respect to the
present coldness that existed between them, they (the Misses Peterkin)
desired to show
<pb id="browne205" n="205"/>
off “before the discredited school-mistress.” I heard Miss Bradly
ask Mr. Peterkin when he heard from young master.</p>
          <p>“I've just got a letter from Dr. Mandy. They ar' still in New
Orleans; but expected to start for home in 'bout three days.
The doctor gives me very little cause for hope; says Johnny is
mighty weak, and had a pretty tough cough. He says the
mighty night-sweats can't be broke; and the boy is very weak, not
able to set up an hour at a time. This is very discouragin,' Miss Emily.
Sometimes it 'pears like 'twould kill me, too, my heart is so sot 'pon that
boy;” and here Mr. Peterkin began to smoke with great violence, a sure
sign that he was laboring under intense excitement.</p>
          <p>“He is a very noble youth,” said Miss Bradly, with a quivering voice
and a moist eye; “I am deeply attached to him, and the thought of his
death is one fraught with pain to me. I hope Doctor Mandy is deceived
in the prognostics he deems so bad. Johnny's life is a bright example, and one that is needed.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, you think it will aid the Abolition cause; but not in
this region, I can assure you,” said Miss Tildy, as she tossed her head
knowingly. <corr>“</corr>I'd like to know where Johnny learned all the Anti-slavery
cant. Do you know, Miss Emily, that your incendiary principles lost
you caste in this neighborhood, where
you once, stood as a model?”</p>
          <p>Miss Tildy had touched Miss Bradly in her vulnerable point.
“Caste” was a thing that she valued above reputation, and reckoned
more desirable than honor. Had it not been for a certain
goodness of heart, from which she could not escape (though she had
offten tried) she would have renounced her Anti-slavery sentiments and
never again avowed them; but young master's words had power to
rescue her almost shipwrecked principles, and then, whilst smarting
under the lash of his rebuke, she attempted, like many an astute
politician, to “run on both sides of the question;” but this was an
equivocal position that the “out and out” Kentuckians were not going to
allow. She had to be, in their distinct phraseology, “one thing or the
other;” and, accordingly, aided by young master and her sense of justice,
<pb id="browne206" n="206"/>
she avowed herself “the other.” And, of course, with this avowal,
came the loss of cherished friends. In troops they fell away from her.
Their averted looks and distant nods nearly drove her mad. If young
master had been by to encourage and sustain her with gracious words,
she could have better borne it; but, single-handed and alone, she could
not battle against adversity. And now this speech of Miss Tildy's was
very untimely. She winced under it, yet dared not reply. What a
contemptible character, to the brave mind, seems one lacking moral
courage!</p>
          <p>“I want to see Johnny once again, and then I shall leave for the
North,” said Miss Bradly, in a pitiful tone.</p>
          <p>“See Naples and die, eh?” laughed Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Always and ever ready with your fun,” replied Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>At first her wiry turnings, her open and shameless sycophancy, and
now her cringing and fawning upon the Peterkins, caused me to lose all
respect for her. In the hour of her trouble, when deserted by those whom
she had loved as friends, when her pecuniary prospects were blighted, I
felt deeply for her, and even forgave the falsehood; but now when I saw
her shrink from the taunt and invective of Miss Tildy, and then minister
to her vanity, I felt that she was too little even for contempt. At tea, that
evening, whilst serving the table, I was surprised to observe Miss Jane's
face very red with anger, and her manner exceedingly irascible. I began to
wonder if I had done anything to exasperate her; but could think of no
offence of which I had been guilty. I knew from the way in which she
conversed with all at the table, that none of them were offenders. I was
the more surprised at her anger, as she had been, for the last week, in
such an excellent humor, getting herself ready for the visit to the city.
Oh, how I dreaded to see Miss Bradly leave, for then, I knew the storm
would break in all its fury!</p>
          <p>I was standing in the kitchen, alone, trying to think what could have
offended Miss Jane, when Amy came up to me, saying,</p>
          <pb id="browne207" n="207"/>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, two silver forks is lost, an' Miss Tildy done 'cuse
me of stealin' 'em, an' I declar 'fore heaven, I gib ebery one
of 'em to Miss Tildy de mornin' Misser Summerbille lef, an'
now she done told Miss Jane dat I told a lie, and that I stole
'em. Lor' knows what dey is gwine to do 'long wid me;
but I don't kere much, so dey kills me soon and sets me out my
misery at once.”</p>
          <p>“When did they miss the forks</p>
          <p>“Wy, to-night, when I went to set de table, I found dat two of 'em
wasn't dar; so I axed Miss Tildy whar dey was, an' she said she didn't
know. Den I axed Miss Jane; she say, 'ax Miss Tildy.' Den when I told
Miss Tildy dat, she got mad; struck me a lick right cross my face. Den I
told her bout de time Mr. Summerbille lef, when I give 'em to her—
She say, 'you's a liar, an' hab stole 'em.' Den I begun to declar I hadn't,
and she call Miss Jane, and say to her dat she knowed I hab stole 'em,
and Miss Jane got mad; kicked me, pulled my har till I screamed; den I
'spose she did 'ant want Miss Bradly to hear me; so she stopped, but
swar she'd beat me to death if I didn't get 'em fur her right off. Now,
Ann, I doesn't know whar dey is, if I was to be kilt for it.”</p>
          <p>She drew the back of her hand across her eyes, and I saw
that it was moist. I was glad of this, for her silent endurance was more
horrible to look upon than this physical softness.</p>
          <p>“Oh, God” I exclaimed, “I would that young master were here.”</p>
          <p>“What fur, Ann?”</p>
          <p>“He might intercede and prevent them from using you so
cruelly.”</p>
          <p>“I doesn't wish he was har; for I lubs young Masser, an' he
is good; if he was to see me a sufferin' it wud stress him, an'
make his complaint worse; an' he couldn't do no good; for
dey will beat me, no matter who begs. Ob, it does seem so
strange that black people was eber made. I is glad dat de
chillen is'nt har; for de sight ob dem cryin' round de ‘post,’
<pb id="browne208" n="208"/>
wud nearly kill me. I can bar anythin' fur myself, but not fur 'em. Oh, I
hopes dey is dead.”</p>
          <p>And here she heaved a dreadful groan. This was the first time I had
heard her allude to them, and I felt a choking rush in my throat.</p>
          <p>“Don't cry, Ann, take kere ob yourself. It 'pears like my time has
come. I don't feel 'feard, an' dis is de fust time I'se eber bin able to speak
'bout de chillen. If eber you sees 'em, (I niver will), tell 'em dat I niver
did forget 'em; dat night an' day my mind was sot on 'em, an' please,
Ann, gib 'em dis.”</p>
          <p>Here she took from her neck a string that held her mother's gift, and
the coin young master had given her, suspended to it. She looked at it
long and wistfully, then, slowly pressing it to her lips, she said in a low,
plaintive voice that went to my heart,
“Poor Mammy.”</p>
          <p>I then took it from her, and hid it in my pocket. A cold horror stole
over me. I had not the power to gainsay her; for an instinctive idea that
something terrible was going to occur, chained my lips.</p>
          <p>“Ann, I thanks you for all your kindness to me. I hopes you may
hab a better time den I has hab. I feel, Ann, as if I niver should come
down from dat post alive.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Trust in God, Amy.”</p>
          <p>She shook her head despairingly.</p>
          <p>“He will save you.”</p>
          <p>“No, God don't kare for black folks.”</p>
          <p>“What did young master tell you about that? Did he not say God
loved all His creatures alike?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but black folks aint God's critters.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, they are, just as much as white people.”</p>
          <p>“No dey aint.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Amy, I wish I could make you understand how it is.”</p>
          <p>“You kant make me belieb dat ar' way, no how you can fix it. God
don't kare what a comes ob niggers; an' I is glad he don't, kase when I
dies, I'll jist lay down and rot like de worms, and dere wont be no
white folks to 'buse me.”</p>
          <pb id="browne209" n="209"/>
          <p>“No, there will be no white folks to abuse you in heaven; but God
and His angels will love you, if you will do well and try to get there.”</p>
          <p>“I don't want to go ther, for God is one of the white people, and, in
course, he'd beat de niggers.”</p>
          <p>Oh, was not this fearful, fearful ignorance? Through the solid rock of
her obtusity, I could, with no argument of mine, make an aperture for a
ray of heavenly light to penetrate. Do Christians, who send off
missionaries, realize that heathendom exists in their very midst; aye,
almost at their own hearthstone? Let them enlighten those that dwell in
the bonds of night on their own borders; then shall their efforts in
distant lands be blest. Numberless instances, such as the one I have
recorded, exist in the slave States. The masters who instruct their slaves
in religion, could be numbered; and I will venture to assert that, if the
census were taken in the State of Kentucky, the number would not
exceed twenty. Here and there you will find an instance of a mistress
who will, perhaps, on a Sunday evening, talk to a female slave about the
propriety of behaving herself; but the gist of the argument, the hinge
upon which it turns, is—“obey your master and mistress;” upon this one
precept hang all the law and the prophets.”</p>
          <p>That night, after my house duties were discharged, I went to the
cabin, where I found Amy lying on Tier face, weeping bitterly. I lifted
her up, and tried to console her; but she exclaimed, with more energy
than I had ever heard her,</p>
          <p>“Ann, every ting seems so dark to me. I kan't see past tomorrow. I
has bin thinkin' of Aunt Polly; I keeps seein' her, no matter what way I
turns.”</p>
          <p>“You are frightened,” I ventured to say.</p>
          <p>“No, I isn't, but I feels curus.”</p>
          <p>“Let me teach you to pray.”</p>
          <p>“Will it do me any good?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, if you put faith in God.”</p>
          <p>“What's faith?”</p>
          <p>“Believe that God is strong and willing to save you; that is faith.”</p>
          <pb id="browne210" n="210"/>
          <p>“Who is God? I never seed him.”</p>
          <p>“No, but He sees you.”</p>
          <p>“Whar is He?” and she looked fearfully around the room, in which the
scanty fire threw a feeble glare.</p>
          <p>“Everywhere. He is everywhere,” I answered.</p>
          <p>“Is He in dis room?” she asked in terror, and drew near me.</p>
          <p>“Yes, He is here.”</p>
          <p>“Oh lor! He may tell Masser on me.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>This ignorance may, to the careless reader, seem laughable; but, to me,
it was most horrible, and I could not repress my tears. Here was the
force of education. Master was to her the strongest thing or person in
existence. Of course she could not understand a higher power than that
which had governed her life. There are hundreds as ignorant; but no
missionaries come to enlighten them!</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't speak that way; you know God made you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but dat was to please Masser. He made me fur to be a slave.”</p>
          <p>Now, how would the religious slave-holder answer that?</p>
          <p>I strove, but with no success, to make her understand that over her
soul, her temporal master had no control; but her ignorance could not
see a difference between the body and soul. Whoever owned the former,
she thought, was entitled to the latter. Finding I could make no
impression upon her mind, I lay down and tried to sleep; but rest was
an alien to me. I dreaded the breaking of the morn. Poor Amy slept, and
I was glad that she did. Her overtaxed body yielded itself up to the most
profound rest. In the morning, when I saw her sleeping so soundly on
the pallet, I disliked to arouse her. I felt, as I fancied a human jailer must
feel, whose business it is to awaken a criminal on the morning of his
execution; yet I had it to do, for, if she had been tardy at her work, it
would have enraged her tyrants the more, and been worse for her.</p>
          <p>Rubbing her eyes, she sat upright on the pallet and murmured,</p>
          <p>“Dis is de day. I's to be led to de post, and maybe kilt.”</p>
          <p>I dared not comfort her, and only bade her to make haste and attend
to her work.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>AT breakfast, Miss Jane shook her head at Amy, saying,</p>
          <p>“I'll settle accounts with you, presently.”</p>
          <p>I wondered if that tremulous form, that stood eyeing her in affright,
did not soften her; but no, the “shaking culprit,” as she styled Amy,
was the very creature upon whom she desired to deal swift justice.</p>
          <p>Pitiable was the sight in the kitchen, where Jake and Dan, great stout
fellows, were making their breakfasts off of scraps of meat, old bones
and corn-bread, whilst the aroma of coffee, broiled chicken, and
egg-cakes was wafted to them from the house-table.</p>
          <p>“I wish't I had somepin' more to eat,” said Dan.</p>
          <p>“You's never satisfy,” replied Sally, the cook; “you gits jist as much
as de balance, yit you makes de most complaints.”</p>
          <p>“No I doesn't.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, you does; don't he, Jake?”</p>
          <p>“Why, to be sartain he does,” said Jake, who of late had agreed to
live with Sally as a wife. Of course no matrimonial rite was allowed, for
Mr. Peterkin was consistent enough to say, that, as the law did not
recognize the validity of negro marriages, he saw no use of the
tomfoolery of a preacher in the case; and this is all reasonable enough.</p>
          <p>“You allers takes Sal's part,” said Dan, “now sense she has got to be your wife; you and her is allers colloged together agin' de rest ov us.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, haint I right for to 'tect my ole 'oman?”</p>
          <pb id="browne212" n="212"/>
          <p>“Now, ha, ha!” cried Nace, as he entered, “de idee ob yer 'tectin' a
wife! I jist wisht Masser sell yer apart, den whar is yer 'tection ob one
anoder?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, dat am very different. Den I'd jist git me anoder ole 'oman, an'
she'd git her anoder ole man.”</p>
          <p>“Sure an' I would,” was Sally's reply; “hain't I done had five old men
already, an' den if Jake be sole, I'de git somebody else.”</p>
          <p>“White folks don't do dat ar' way,” interposed Dan, as he picked
away at a bone.</p>
          <p>“In course dey don't. Why should dey?” put in Nace.
“Ain't dey our Massers, and habn't dey dar own way in ebery ting?”</p>
          <p>“I wisht I'd bin born white,” added Dan.</p>
          <p>“Ya, ya, dat is funny!”</p>
          <p>“Do de free colored folks live like de whites?” asked Sally.</p>
          <p>“Why, laws, yes; once when I went with Masser to L.,” Nace began,
“at de tavern whar we put up, dar was a free collored man what waited
on de table, and anoder one what kipt barber-shop in de tavern. Wal
dey was drest as nice as white men. Dar dey had dar standin' collar, and
nice cravat, and dar broadcloth, and dar white handkersher; and de
barber, he had some wool growin' on his upper lip jist like de quality
men. Ya, ya, but I sed dis am funny; so when I 'gin to talk jist as dough
dey was niggers same as I is, dey straighten 'emselves up and tell me dat
I was a speakin' to a gemman. Wal, says I,
haint your faces black as mine? Niggers aint gemmen, says I, for I thought
I'd take dar airs down; but den, dey spunk up and say dey was not
niggers, but colored pussons, and dey call one anoder Mr. Wal I t'ought
it was quare enoff; and more an' dat, white folks speak 'spectable to 'em,
jist same as dey war white. Whole lot ob white gemmans come in de
barbershop to be shaved; and den dey'd pay de barber, and maybe like
as not, set down and talk 'long wid him.”</p>
          <p>There is no telling how long the garrulous Nace would have continued
the narration of what he saw in L—, had he not been
<pb id="browne213" n="213"/>
suddenly interrupted by the entrance of Miss Tildy, inquiring for
Amy.</p>
          <p>Instantly all of them assumed that cheerful, smiling, sycophantic
manner, which is well known to all who have ever looked in at the
kitchen of a slaveholder. Amy stood out from the group to answer Miss
Tildy's summons. I shall never forget the expression of subdued misery
that was limned upon her face.</p>
          <p>“Come in the house and account for the loss of those forks,” said
Miss Tildy, in the most peremptory manner.</p>
          <p>Amy made no reply to this; but followed the lady into the house.
There she was court-marshalled, and of course, found guilty of a high
misdemeanor.</p>
          <p>“Wal,” said Mr. Peterkin, “we'll see if the ‘post’ can't draw from you
whar you've put 'em. Come with me.”</p>
          <p>With a face the picture of despair, she followed.</p>
          <p>Upon reaching the post, she was fastened to it by the wrist and ankle
fetters; and Mr. Peterkin, foaming with rage, dipped his cowhide in the
strongest brine that could be made, and drawing it up with a flourish, let
it descend upon her uncovered back with a lacerating stroke. Heavens!
what a shriek she gave! Another blow, another and a deeper stripe, and
cry after cry came from the hapless victim!</p>
          <p>“Whar is the forks?” thundered Mr. Peterkin, “tell me, or I'll have
the worth out of yer cussed hide.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed, indeed, Masser, I doesn't know.”</p>
          <p>“You are a liar,” and another and a severer blow.</p>
          <p>“Whar is they?”</p>
          <p>“I give 'em to Miss Jane, Masser, indeed I did.”</p>
          <p>“Take that, you liar,” and again he struck her, and thus he continued
until he had to stop from exhaustion. There she stood, partially naked,
bleeding at every wound, yet none of us dared go near and offer her
even a glass of cold water.</p>
          <p>“Has she told where they are?” asked Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“No, she says she give 'em to you.”</p>
          <p>“Well, she tells an infamous lie; and I hope you will beat
<pb id="browne214" n="214"/>
her until pain forces her to acknowledge what she has done with
them.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I'll git it out of her yet, and by blood, too.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, father, Amy needs a good whipping,” said Miss Jane, for she has
been sulky ever since we took her in the house. Two or three times I've
thought of asking you to have her taken to the post.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I've noticed that she's give herself a good many ars. It does me
rale good to take 'em out of her.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, father, you are a real negro-breaker. They don't dare behave
badly where you are.”</p>
          <p>This, Mr. Peterkin regarded as high praise; for, whenever he related
the good qualities of a favorite friend, he invariably mentioned that he
was a “tight master;” so he smiled at his daughter's compliment.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said Miss Tildy, “whenever father approaches, the darkies
should set up the tune, ‘See the conquering hero comes.’ ”</p>
          <p>“Good, first-rate, Tildy,” replied Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“ 'Till is a wit.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, you are both high-larn't gals, a-head of yer pappy.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, father, please don't speak in that way.”</p>
          <p>“It was the fashion when I was edicated.”</p>
          <p>“Just listen,” they both exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“Jake,” called out Mr. Peterkin, whose wrath was getting excited by
the criticisms of his daughters, “go and bring Amy here.”</p>
          <p>In a few moments Jake returned, accompanied by Amy. The blood
was oozing through the body and sleeves of the frock that she had
hastily thrown on.</p>
          <p>“Whar's the spoons?” thundered out Mr. Peterkin.</p>
          <p>“I give 'em to Miss Tildy.”</p>
          <p>“You are a liar,” said Miss Tildy, as she dashed up to her, and struck
her a severe blow on the temple with a heated poker. Amy dared not
parry the blow; but, as she received it, she fell
<pb id="browne215" n="215"/>
fainting to the floor. Mr. Peterkin ordered Jake to take her out of their
presence.</p>
          <p>She was taken to the cabin and left lying on the floor. When I went in
to see her, a horrid spectacle met my view! There she lay stretched
upon the floor, blood oozing from her whole body. I washed it off
nicely and greased her wounds, as poor Aunt Polly had once done for
me; but these attentions had to be rendered in a very secret manner. It
would have been called treason, and punished as such, if I had been
discovered.</p>
          <p>I had scarcely got her cleansed, and her wounds dressed, before she
was sent for again.</p>
          <p>“Now,” said Miss Tildy, “if you will tell me what you did with the
forks, I will excuse you; but, if you dare to say you don't know, I'll beat
you to death with this,” and she held up a bunch of briery switches,
that she had tied together. Now only imagine briars digging and scraping
that already lacerated flesh, and you will not blame the equivocation to
which the poor wretch was driven.</p>
          <p>“Where are they?” asked Miss Jane, and her face was frightful as the
Medusa's.</p>
          <p>“I hid 'em under a barrel out in the back yard.”</p>
          <p>“Well, go and get them.”</p>
          <p>“Stay,” said Miss Jane, “I'll go with you, and see if they are there.”</p>
          <p>Accordingly she went off with her, but they were not there.</p>
          <p>“Now, where are they, <hi rend="ITALICS">liar</hi>?” she asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Miss Jane, I put 'em here; but I 'spect somebody's done stole
'em.”</p>
          <p>“No, you never put them there,” said Miss Tildy. “Now tell me
where they are, or I'll give you this with a vengeance,” and she shook
the briers.</p>
          <p>“I put 'em in my box in the cabin.”</p>
          <p>And thither they went to look for them. Not finding them there, the
tortured girl then named some other place, but with as little success
they looked elsewhere.</p>
          <p>“Now,” said Miss Tildy, “I have done all that the most
<pb id="browne216" n="216"/>
humane or just could demand; and I find that nothing but a touch
of this can get the truth from you, so come with me.” She took
her to the “lock-up,” and secured the door within. Such
screams as issued thence, I pray heaven may never hear
again. It seemed as if a fury's strength endowed Miss Tildy's
arm.</p>
          <p>When she came out she was pale from fatigue.</p>
          <p>“I've beaten that girl till I've no strength in me, and she has less life in
her; yet she will not say what she did with the forks.”</p>
          <p>“I'll go in and see if I can't get it out of her,” said Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“Wait awhile, Jane, maybe she will, after a little reflection, agree to
tell the truth about it.</p>
          <p>“Never,” said Miss Jane, “a nigger will never tell the truth till it is
beat out of her.” So saying she took the key from Miss Tildy, and bade
me follow her. I had rather she had told me to hang myself.</p>
          <p>When she unlocked the door, I dared not look in. My eyes were
riveted to the ground until I heard Miss Jane say:</p>
          <p>“Get up, you hussy.”</p>
          <p>There, lying on the ground, more like a heap of clotted gore than a
human being, I beheld the miserable Amy.</p>
          <p>“Why don't she get up?” inquired Miss Jane. I did not reply. Taking
the cowhide, she gave her a severe lick, and the wretch cried out, “Oh,
Lord!”</p>
          <p>“The Lord won't hear a liar,” said Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“Oh , what will 'come of me?”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="ITALICS">Death</hi>, if you don't confess what you did with the forks.”</p>
          <p>“Oh God, hab mercy! Miss Jane, please don't beat me any more.
My poor back is so sore. It aches and smarts dreadful,” and she lifted
up her face, which was one mass of raw flesh; and wiping or trying to
wipe the blood away from her eyes with a piece of her sleeve that had
been cut from her body, she besought Miss Jane to have mercy on her;
but the spirit of her father was too strongly inherited for Jane Peterkin
to know aught of human pity.</p>
          <pb id="browne217" n="217"/>
          <p>“Where are the forks?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, law! oh, law!” Amy cried out, “I swar I doesn't know anything
'bout 'em.”</p>
          <p>Such blows as followed I have not the heart to describe; for they
descended upon flesh already horribly mangled.</p>
          <p>The poor girl looked up to me, crying out:</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, beg for me.”</p>
          <p>“Miss Jane,” I ventured to say; but the tigress turned and struck me
such a blow across the face, that I was blinded for full five minutes.</p>
          <p>“There, take that! you impudent hussy. Do you dare to ask me not
to punish a thief?”</p>
          <p>I made no reply, but withdrew from her presence to cleanse my face
from the blood that was flowing from the wound.</p>
          <p>As I bathed my face and bound it up, I wondered if acts such as these
had ever been reported to those clergymen, who so stoutly maintain that
slavery is just, right, <hi rend="ITALICS">and almost</hi> available unto salvation. I cannot think
that they do understand it in all its direful wrongs. They look upon the
institution, doubtless, as one of domestic servitude, where a strong
attachment exists between the slave and his owner; but, alas! all that is
generally fabulous, worse than fictitious. I can fearlessly assert that I
never knew a single case, where this sort of feeling was cherished. The
very nature of slavery precludes the existence of such a feeling. Read the
legal definition of it as contained in the statute books of Kentucky and
Virginia, and how, I ask you, can there be, on the slave's part, a love for
his owner? Oh, no, that is the strangest resort, the fag-end of argument;
that most transparent fiction. Love, indeed! The slave-master love his
slave! Did Cain love Abel? Did Herod love those innocents, whom, by a
bloody edict, he consigned to death? In the same category of lovers will
we place the slave-owner.</p>
          <p>When Miss Jane had beaten Amy until <hi rend="italics">she</hi> was satisfied, she came,
with a face blazing, like Mars, from the “lock-up.”</p>
          <p>“Well, she confesses now, that she put the forks under the corner of
a log, near the poultry coop.”</p>
          <pb id="browne218" n="218"/>
          <p>“Its only another one of her lies,” replied Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Well, if it is, I'll beat her until she tells the truth, or I'll kill her.”</p>
          <p>So saying, she started off to examine the spot. I felt that this was but
another subterfuge, devised by the poor wretch to gain a few moments'
respite.</p>
          <p>The examination proved, as I had anticipated, a failure.</p>
          <p>“What's to be done?” inquired Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Leave her a few moments longer to herself, and then if the truth is
not obtained from her, kill her.” These words came hissing though her
clenched teeth.</p>
          <p>“It won't do to kill her,” said Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“I don't care much if I do.”</p>
          <p>“We would be tried for murder.”</p>
          <p>“Who would be our accusers? Who the witnesses? You forget that
Jones is not here to testify.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, and so we are safe.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I never premeditate anything without, counting the cost.”</p>
          <p>“But then the loss of property!”</p>
          <p>“I'd rather gratify my revenge than have five hundred dollars, which
would be her highest market value.”</p>
          <p>Tell me, honest reader, was not she, at heart, a murderess? Did she
not plan and premeditate the deed? Who were her accusers? That God
whose first law she had outraged; that same God who asked Cain for his
slain brother.</p>
          <p>“Now,” said Miss Jane, after she had given the poor creature only a
few moments relief, “now let me go and see what that wretch has to say
about the forks.”</p>
          <p>“More lies,” added Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“Then her fate is sealed,” said the human hyena.</p>
          <p>Turning to me, she added, in the most authoritative manner,
“Come with me, and mind that you obey me; none of your
impertinent tears, or I'll give you this.”</p>
          <p>And she struck me a lick across the shoulders. I can assure you I felt
but little inclination to do anything whereby such a
<pb id="browne219" n="219"/>
penalty might be incurred. Taking the key of the “lock up” from her
pocket, she ordered me to open the door. With a trembling hand I
obeyed. Slowly the old, rusty-hinged door swung open, and oh,
heavens! what a sight it revealed! There, in the centre of the dismal
room, suspended from a spoke, about
three feet from the ground, was the body of Amy! Driven by
desperation, goaded to frenzy, she had actually hung herself!
Oh, God! that fearful sight is burnt in on my brain, with a
power that no wave of Lethe can ever wash out! There,
covered with clotted blood, bruised and mangled, hung the
wretched girl! There, a bleeding, broken monument of the white man's
and white woman's cruelty! God of my sires! is there for us no
redress? And Miss Jane—what did she do?
Why, she screamed, and almost swooned with fright! Ay, too late it
was to rend the welkin with her cries of distress. She had done the
deed! Upon her head rested the sin of that freshly-shed blood! She was
the real murderess. Oh, frightful
shall be her nights! Peopled with racks, execution-blocks,
and ghastly gallows-poles, shall be her dreams! At the lone
hour of midnight, a wan and bloody <sic corr="corpse">corse</sic> shall glide around
her bed-side, and shriek into her trembling ear the horrid word
“murderess!” Let me still remain in bondage, call me still by the
ignoble title of slave, but leave me the unbought and priceless
inheritance of a stainless conscience. I am free of murder
before God and man. Still riot in your wealth; still batten
on inhumanity, women of the white complexion, but of the black
hearts! I envy you not. Still let me rejoice in a darker face, but
a snowy, self-approving conscience.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane's screams brought Mr. Peterkin, Miss Tildy and the
servants to her side. There, in front of the open door of
the lock-up, they stood, gazing upon that revolting spectacle! No word
was spoken. Each regarded the others in awe. At
length, Mr. Peterkin, whose heartlessness was equal to any
emergency, spoke to Jake:</p>
          <p>“Cut down that body, and bury it instantly.”</p>
          <p>With this, they all turned away from the tragical spot; but
<pb id="browne220" n="220"/>
I, though physically weak of nerve, still remained. That poor, bereaved
girl had been an object of interest to me; and I could not now leave her
distorted and lifeless body. Cold-hearted ones were around her; no
friendly eye looked upon her mangled <sic corr="corpse">corse</sic>, and I shuddered when I
saw Jake and Dan rudely handle the body upon which death had set its
sacred seal.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>CONVERSATION OF THE FATHER AND SON—THE DISCOVERY;
ITS CONSEQUENCES—DEATH OF THE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>VERY lonely to me were the nights that succeeded Amy's death. I
spent them alone in the cabin. A strange kind of superstition took
possession of me! The room was peopled with unearthly guests. I
buried my face in the bed-covering, as if that could protect me or
exclude supernatural visitors. For two weeks I scarcely slept at all; and
my constitution had begun to sink under the over-taxation. This was all
the worse, as Amy's death entailed upon me a double portion of work.</p>
          <p>“What!” said Mr. Peterkin to me, one day, “are you agoin to die, too, Ann? Any time you gits in the notion, jist let me know, and I'll
give you rope enough to do it.”</p>
          <p>In this taunting way he frequently alluded to that fatal tragedy
which should have bowed his head with shame and remorse.</p>
          <p>Young master had returned, but not at all benefited by his trip. A
deep carnation was burnt into his shrivelled cheek, and he walked with
a feeble, tottering step. The least physical exertion would bring on a
violent paroxysm of coughing. The unnatural glitter of his eye, with its
purple surroundings, gave me great uneasiness; but he was the same
gentle, kind-spoken young master that he had ever been. His glossy,
golden hair had a dead, dry appearance; whilst his chest was fearfully
sunken; yet his father refused to believe that all these marks were the
heralds of the great enemy's approach.</p>
          <p>“The spring will cure you, my boy.”</p>
          <p>“No, father, the spring is coming fast; but long before its
<pb id="browne222" n="222"/>
flowers begin to scent the vernal gales, I shall have passed through the
narrow gateway of the tomb.”</p>
          <p>“No, it shall not be. All my money shall go to save you.”</p>
          <p>“I am purchased, father, with a richer price than gold; the inestimable
blood of the Lamb has long since paid my ransom; I go to my father in
heaven.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, my son! you want to go; you want to leave me. You do not
love your father.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I do love you, father, very dearly; and I would that you were
going with me to that lovely land.”</p>
          <p>“I shill never go thar.”</p>
          <p>“'Tis that fear that is killing me, father.”</p>
          <p>“What could I, now, do to be saved?”</p>
          <p>“Believe in the Lord Jesus, and be baptized.”</p>
          <p>“Is that all?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, that is all; but it embraces a good deal, dear father; a good deal
more than most persons deserve. In order to a perfect belief in the Lord
Jesus, you must act consistently with that belief. You must deal justly.
Abundantly give to the poor, and, above all, you must love mercy, and
do mercifully to all. Now I approach the great subject upon which I fear
you will stumble. You must,” and he pronounced the words very
slowly, “liberate your slaves.” There was a fair gleam from his eyes
when he said this.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin turned uneasily in his chair. He did not wish to
encourage a conversation upon this subject.</p>
          <p>One evening, when it had been raining for two or three days, and the
damp condition of the atmosphere had greatly increased young master's
complaint, he called me to his bedside.</p>
          <p>“Ann,” he said, in that deep, sepulchral tone, “I wish to ask you a
question, and I urge you not to deceive me. Remember I am dying, and
it will be a great crime to tell me a falsehood.”</p>
          <p>I assured him that I would answer him with a faithful regard to truth.</p>
          <p>“Then tell me what occasioned Amy's death? Did she come to it by
violence?”</p>
          <pb id="browne223" n="223"/>
          <p>I shall never forget the deep, penetrating glance that he fixed upon
me. It was an inquiry that went to my soul. I could not have answered
him falsely.</p>
          <p>Calmly, quietly, and without exaggeration, I told him all the
circumstances of her death.</p>
          <p>“Murder!” he exclaimed, “murder, foul and most unnatural!”</p>
          <p>I saw him wipe the tears from his hollow eyes, and that sunken
chest heaved with vivid emotion.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin came in, and was much surprised to find young master
so excited.</p>
          <p>“What is the matter, my boy?”</p>
          <p>“The same old trouble, father, these unfortunate negroes.”</p>
          <p>“Hang 'em; let them go to the d—l, at once. They are not worth all
this consarn on your part.”</p>
          <p>“Father, they possess immortal souls, and are a part of Christ's
purchase.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, that kind of talk does very well for preachers and church
members.”</p>
          <p>“It should do for all humanity.”</p>
          <p>“I doesn't know what pity means whar a nigger is consarned.”</p>
          <p>“And 'tis this feeling in you that has cost me my life.”</p>
          <p>“Confound thar black hides. Every one of 'em that ever growed in
Afriky isn't worth that price.”</p>
          <p>“Their souls are as precious in God's eyes as ours, and the laws of
man should recognize their lives as valuable.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, now, my boy! don't talk any more 'bout it. It only 'stresses
you far nothing.”</p>
          <p>“No, it distresses me for a great deal. For the value of
Christ-purchased souls.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin concluded the argument as he usually did, when it
reached a knotty point, by leaving. All that evening I noticed that
young master was unusually restless and feverish. His mournful eyes
would follow me withersoever I moved about the room. From the
constant and earnest movement of his lips, I knew that he was engaged
in prayer.</p>
          <pb id="browne224" n="224"/>
          <p>When Miss Bradly came in and looked at him, I thought, from the
frightened expression of her face, that she detected some alarming
symptoms. This apprehension was confirmed by the manner of Dr.
Mandy. All the rest of the evening, I wandered near Miss Bradly
and the doctor, trying to catch, from their conversation, what they
thought of young master's condition; but they were very guarded in
what they said, well knowing how acutely sensitive Mr. Peterkin was
on the subject. Miss Jane and Miss Tildy did not appear in the least anxious
or uneasy about him. They sewed away upon their silks and
laces, never once thinking that the angel of death was hovering
over their household and about to snatch from their embrace
one of their most cherished idols. Verily, oh, Death, thou art
like a thief in the night; with thy still, feline tread, thou
enterest our chambers and stealest our very breath away
without one admonition of thy coming!</p>
          <p>But not so came he to young master. As a small-voiced angel, with
blessings concealed beneath his shadowy wing, he came, the herald of
better days to him! As a well-loved bridegroom to a waiting bride, was
the angel of the tombs to that expectant spirit! 'Twas painful, yet
pleasant, to watch with what patient courage he endured bodily pain.
Often, unnoticed by him, did I watch, with a terrible fascination, the
heroic struggle with which he wrestled with suffering and disease. Sad and
piteous were the shades and inflections of severe agony that passed over
his noble face! I recall now with sorrow, the memory of that time!
How well, in fancy, can I see him, as he lay upon that downy bed, with
his beautiful gold hair thrown far back from his sunken temples, his blue,
upturned eyes, fringed by their lashes of fretted gold, and those pale,
thin hands that toyed so fitfully with the drapery of the couch, and the
restless, loving look which he so frequently cast upon each of the dear
ones who drew around him. It must be that the “sun-set of life” gives
us a keener, quicker sense, else why do we love the more fondly as the
curtain of eternity begins to descend upon us? Surely, there must be a
deeper, undeveloped
<pb id="browne225" n="225"/>
sense lying beneath the surface of general feeling, which only the
tightening of life's cords can reveal! He grew gentler, if possible, as his
death approached. Very heavenly seemed he in those last, most trying moments!
All that had ever been earthly of him, began to recede; the fleshly taints
(if there were any) grew fainter and fainter, and the glorious
spiritual predominated! Angel more than mortal, seemed he. The
lessons which his life taught me have sunk deep in my nature; and I can
well say, “it was good for him to have been here.”</p>
          <p>It was a few weeks after the death of Amy, when Miss Tildy was
overlooking the bureau that contained the silver and glass ware, she
gave a sudden exclamation, that, without knowing why, startled me
very strangely. A thrill passed over my frame, an icy contraction of the
nerves, and I knew that something awful was about to be revealed.</p>
          <p>“What <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the matter with you?” asked Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>Still she made no reply, but buried her face in her hands,
and remained thus for several minutes; when she did look up, I saw
that something terrible was working in her breast.
“Culprit,” was written all over her face. It was visible in the downcast
terror of her eye, and in the blanched contraction of
the lips, and quivered in the dilating nostril, and was stamped upon
the whitening brow!</p>
          <p>“What ails you, Tildy?” again inquired her sister.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Why, look here!</hi>” and she held up, to my terror, the two missing
forks!</p>
          <p>Oh, heavens! and for her own carelessness and mistake had
Amy been sacrificed? I make no comment. I merely state the case, and
leave others to draw their own conclusions. Yet, this much I will add,
that there were no Caucasian witnesses
to the bloody deed, therefore no legal cognizance could be taken of it!
Most noble and righteous American laws! Who that lives beneath your
shelter, would dare to say they are not wise and sacred as the laws of
the Decalogue? Thrice a day should their authors go up into the
Temple, and thank our Lord that they are not like publicans and
sinners.</p>
          <pb id="browne226" n="226"/>
          <p>One evening—oh! I shall long remember it, is one full of sacredness,
full of sorrow, and yet tinged with a hue of heaven! It was in the deep,
delicious beauty of the flowering month of May. The twilight was
unusually red and refulgent. The evening star shone like the full eye of
love upon the dreamy earth! The flowers, each with a dew-pearl
glittering on its petals, lay lulled by the calm of the hour. Young master,
fair saint, lay on his bed near the open window, through which the
scented gales stole sweetly, and fanned his wasted cheek! Thick and
hard came his breath, and we, who stood around him, could almost see
the presence of the “monster grim,” whose skeleton arms were fast
locking him about!</p>
          <p>Flitting round the bed, like a guardian spirit, was Miss Bradly,
whilst her tearful eye never wandered for an instant from that face now
growing rigid with the kiss of death! Miss Jane stood at the head of the
bed wiping the cold damps from his brow, and Miss Tildy was striving
to impart some of her animal warmth to his icy feet. Mr. Peterkin sat
with one of those thin hands grasped within his own, as if disputing
and defying the advance of that enemy whom no man is strong enough
to baffle.</p>
          <p>Slowly the invalid turned upon his couch, and, looking out upon the
setting sun, he heaved a deep sigh.</p>
          <p>“Father,” he said, as he again turned his face toward Mr. Peterkin,
who still clasped his hand, “do you not know from my failing pulse,
that my life is almost spent?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, my boy, it is too, too hard to give you up.”</p>
          <p>“Yet you <hi rend="italics">must</hi> nerve yourself for it.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“I have no nerve to meet this trouble.”</p>
          <p>“Go to God, He will give you ease.”</p>
          <p>“I want Him to give me you.”</p>
          <p><corr>“</corr>Me He lent you for a little while. Now He demands me at your
hands, and His requisition you must obey.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I won't give up; maybe you'll yet be spared to me.”</p>
          <p>“No, God's decree it is, that I should go.”</p>
          <p>“It cannot, shall not be.”</p>
          <pb id="browne227" n="227"/>
          <p>“Father, father, you do but blaspheme.”</p>
          <p>“I will do anything rather than see you die.”</p>
          <p>“I am willing to die. I have only one request to make of you. Will
you grant it? If you refuse me, I shall die wretched and unhappy.”</p>
          <p>“I will promise you anything.”</p>
          <p>“But will you keep your promise?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, my boy.”</p>
          <p>“Do you promise most faithfully?”</p>
          <p>“I do.”</p>
          <p>“Then promise me that you will instantly manumit your slaves.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin hesitated a moment.</p>
          <p>“Father, I shall not die happy, if you refuse me.”</p>
          <p>“Then I promise faithfully to do it.”</p>
          <p>A glad smile broke over the sufferer's face, like a sunbeam over a
snow-cloud.</p>
          <p>“Now, at least I can die contentedly! God will bless your effort, and
a great weight has been removed from my oppressed heart.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Mandy now entered the room; and, taking young master's hand
within his own, began to count the pulsations. A very ominous change
passed over his face.</p>
          <p>“Oh, doctor,” cried the patient, “I read from your countenance the
thoughts that agitate your mind; but do not fear to make the disclosure
to my friends even here. It will do me no harm. I know that my hours
are numbered; but I am willing, nay, anxious to go. Life has been one
round of pain, and now, as I am about to leave the world, I take with
me a blessed assurance that I have not lived in vain. Doctor, I call upon
you, and all the dear ones here present, to witness the fact that my
father has most solemnly promised me to liberate each of his slaves and
never again become the holder of such property<corr sic="?">.</corr>
Father, do you not promise before these witnesses?”</p>
          <p>“I do, my child, I do,” said the weeping father.</p>
          <p>“Sisters,” continued young master, “will you promise to urge
<pb id="browne228" n="228"/>
or offer no objection to the furtherance of this sacred wish of your
dying brother?”</p>
          <p>“I do,” “I do,” they simultaneously exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“And neither of you will ever become the owner of slaves?”</p>
          <p>“Never,” “never,” was the stifled reply.</p>
          <p>“Come, now, Death, for I am ready for thee!”</p>
          <p>“You have exerted yourself too much already,” said the doctor,
“now pray take this cordial and try to rest; you have overtaxed
your power. Your strength is waning fast.”</p>
          <p>“No, doctor, I cannot be silent; whilst I've the strength, pray let me
talk. I wish this death-bed to be an example. Call in the servants. Let me
speak with them. I wish to devote my power, all that is left of me now,
to them.”</p>
          <p>To this Mr. Peterkin and the doctor objected, alleging that his life
required quiet.</p>
          <p>“Do not think of me, kind friends, I shall soon be safe, and ,am now
well-cared for. If I did not relieve myself by speech, the anxiety would
kill me. As a kind favor, I beg that you will not interrupt me. Call the
good servants.”</p>
          <p>Instantly they all, headed by Nace, came into the chamber, each
weeping bitterly.</p>
          <p>“Good friends,” he began, and now I noticed that his voice was
weak and trembling, “I am about to leave you. On earth you will never
see me again; but there is a better world, where I trust to meet you all.
You have been faithful and attentive to me. I thank you from the
bottom of my soul for it, and, if ever I have been harsh or unkind to
you in any way, I now beg that you will forgive me. Do not weep,” he
continued, as their loud sobs began to drown his feeble voice. “Do not
weep, I am going to a happy home, where trouble and pain will never
harm me more. Now let me tell you, that my father has promised me
that each of you shall be free immediately after my death.”</p>
          <p>This announcement was like a panic to the poor, broken-spirited
wretches. They looked wonderingly at young master, and then at each
other, never uttering a word.</p>
          <pb id="browne229" n="229"/>
          <p>“Come, do not look so bewildered. Ah, you do not believe me; but,
good as is this news, it is true; is it not, father?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, my son, it is true.”</p>
          <p>When Mr. Peterkin spoke, they simultaneously started. That voice
had power to recall them from the wildest dream of
romance. Though softened by sorrow and suffering, there was still
enough of the wonted harshness to make those poor wretches know it
was Mr. Peterkin who spoke, and they quaked
with fear.</p>
          <p>“In the new home and new position in life, which you will take, my
friends, I hope you will not forget me; but, above all
things, try to save your souls. Go to church; pray much and often.
Place yourselves under God's protection, and all will be right. You,
Jake, had better select as an occupation that of a
farmer, or manager of a farm for some one of those wealthy but humane
men of the Northern States. You, Dan, can make an excellent dray
driver; and at that business, in some of the Northern cities, you would
make money. Sally can get a situation as cook; and Ann, where is Ann?”
he said, as he looked around.</p>
          <p>I stepped out from a retired corner of the room, into which I had
shrunk for the purpose of indulging my grief unobserved.</p>
          <p>“Don't weep, Ann,” he began; “you distress me when you
do so. You ought, rather, to rejoice, because I shall so soon be set free
from this unhappy condition. If you love me, prepare to meet me in
heaven. This earth is not our home; 'tis but a transient abiding-place,
and, to one of my sensitive temperament, it has been none the
happiest. I am glad that I am going; yet a few pangs I feel, in bidding
you farewell; but think of me only as one gone upon a pleasant journey
from snow-clad regions to a land smiling with tropic beauty, rich in
summer bloom and vocal with the melody of southern birds! Think of
me as one who has exchanged the garments of a beggar for the crown of a king and
the singing-robes of a prophet. I hope you will do well in life, and I
would advise that you improve your education, and then become a
teacher. You are fitted for that
<pb id="browne230" n="230"/>
position. You could fill it with dignity. Do all you can to elevate the mind as
well as manners of your most unfortunate race. And now, poor old
Nace, what pursuit must I recommend to you?” After a moment's
pause, he added with a smile, “I will point out none; for you are
Yankee enough, Nace, to get along anywhere.”</p>
          <p>He then requested that we should all kneel, whilst he besought for us
and himself the blessings of Divine grace.</p>
          <p>I can never forget the words of that beautiful prayer. How like fairy
pearls they fell from his lips! And I do not think there was a single
heart present that did not send out a fervent response! It seemed as if
his whole soul were thrown into that one burning appeal to heaven. His
mellow eyes grew purple in their intense passionateness; his pale lip
quivered; and the throbbing veins, that wandered so blue and beautifully
through his temples, were swollen with the rapid tide of emotion.</p>
          <p>As we rose from our knees, he elevated himself upon his elbow, and
looking earnestly at each one of us, said solemnly,</p>
          <p>“God bless all of you!” then sank back upon the pillow; a bright
smile flitted over his face, and he held his hand out to Miss Bradly, who
clasped it lovingly.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, kind friend,” he murmured, “never forsake the noble
Anti-slavery cause. Cling to it as a rock and anchor of safety.
Good-bye, and God bless you.”</p>
          <p>He then gave his other hand to Dr. Mandy, but, in attempting to
speak, he was checked by a violent attack of coughing, and blood gushed
from his mouth. The doctor endeavored to arrest the flow, but in vain;
the crimson tide, like a stream broken loose from its barrier, flowed with
a stifling rush.</p>
          <p>Soon we discovered, from the ghastly whiteness of the patient's face,
and the calm, set stare of the eyes, that his life was almost gone. Oh,
God! how hard, pinched and contracted appeared those once beauteous
features! How terrible was the blank fixedness of those blue orbs! No
motion of the hand could distract their look.</p>
          <pb id="browne231" n="231"/>
          <p>“Heavens!” cried Miss Jane, “his eyes are set!”</p>
          <p>“No, no,” exclaimed Mr. Peterkin, and with many gestures, he
attempted to draw the staring eyes away from the object upon which
they were fastened; but vain were all his endeavors. He had no power
to call back a parting spirit; he, who had sent others to an unblest grave,
could not now breathe fresh vigor into a frame over which Death held
his skeleton arm. Where was Remorse, the unsleeping fiend, in that
moment?</p>
          <p>I was looking earnestly at young master's face, when the great change
passed over it. I saw Dr. Mandy slowly press down the marble
eye-lids and gently straighten the rigid limbs; then, very softly turning to
the friends, whose faces were hidden by their clasped hands, he
murmured,</p>
          <p>“All is over!”</p>
          <p>Great heaven! what screams burst from the afflicted family.</p>
          <p>Mr. Peterkin was crazy. His grief knew no bounds! He raved, he tore
his hair, he struck his breast violently, and then blasphemed. He did
everything but pray. And that was a thing so unfamiliar to him, that he
did not know how to do it. Miss Jane swooned, whilst Miss Tildy
raved out against the injustice of Providence in taking her brother from
her.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly and I laid the body out, dressed it in a suit of pure
white, and filletted his golden curls with a band of white rose-buds.
Like a gentle infant resting in its first, deep sleep, lay he there!</p>
          <p>After spreading the snowy drapery over the body, Miss Bradly
covered all the furniture with white napkins, giving to the room the
appearance of a death-like chill, There were no warm, rosy, life-like
tints. Upon entering it, the very heart grew icy and still. The family,
one by one, retired to their own apartments for the indulgence of
private and sacred grief!</p>

            <p>THE FUNERAL—MISS BRADLY'S DEPARTURE—THE
DISPUTE—SPIRIT QUESTIONS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>WHEN I entered the kitchen, I found the servants still weeping
violently.</p>
          <p>“Poor soul,” said Sally, “he's at rest now. If he hain't gone to heaven, 'taint no use of havin' any; fur he war de best critter I iver seed. He
never gived me a cross word in all his life-time. Oh, Lord, he am gone
now!”</p>
          <p>“I 'members de time, when Mister Jones whipt me, dat young
masser comed to me wid some grease and rubbed me all over, and talked
so kind to me. Den he tell me not to say nothin' 'bout it, and I niver did
mention it from dat day until dis.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, he was mighty good,” added Jake, “and I's sorry he's dead.”</p>
          <p>“I'se glad he got us our freedom afore he died. I wonder if we'll git
it?” asked Nace, who was always intent upon selfishness.</p>
          <p>“Laws! didn't he promise? Den he mus' keep his word,” added
Jake.</p>
          <p>I made no comment. My thoughts upon the subject I kept locked in
the depths of my own bosom. I knew then, as now, that natures like
Mr. Peterkin's could be changed only by the interposition of a miracle.
He had now shrunk beneath the power of a sudden blow of misfortune;
but this would soon pass away, and the savage nature would re-assert
itself.</p>
          <p>All that gloomy night, I watched with Miss Bradly and Dr. Mandy
beside the corpse. Often whilst the others dozed, would I steal to the
bed and turn down the covering, to gaze upon that 
<pb id="browne233" n="233"/>
still pale face! Reverently I placed my hand upon that rich golden head,
with its band of flowers.</p>
          <p>There is an angel-like calm in the repose of death; a subdued awe that
impresses the coldest and most unbelieving hearts! As I looked at that
still body, which had so lately been illumined by a radiant soul, and saw
the noble look which the face yet wore, I inwardly exclaimed, 'Tis well
for those who sleep in the Lord!</p>
          <p>All that long night I watched and waited, hoped and prayed. The
deep, mysterious midnight passed, with all its fearful power of passion
and mystery; the still, small hours glided on as with silver slippers, and
then came the purple glory of a spring dawn! I left the chamber of death,
and went out to muse in the hazy day-break. And, as I there reflected,
my soul grew sick and sore afraid. One by one my friends had been
falling around me, and now I stood alone. There was no kind voice to
cheer me on; no gentle, loving hand stretched forth to aid me; no smile
of friendship to encourage me. In the thickest of the fight, unbucklered, I
must go. Up the weary, craggy mountain I must climb. The burning
sands I must tread alone! What wonder that my spirit, weak and
womanly, trembled and turned away, asking for the removal of the cup
of life! Only the slave can comprehend the amount of agony that I
endured. He alone who clanks the chain of African bondage, can know
what a cloud of sorrow swept over my heart.</p>
          <p>I saw the great sun rise, like a blood-stained gladiator, in the East, and
the diamond dew that glittered in his early light. I saw the roses unclose
fragrantly to his warming call; yet my heart was chill. Through the
flower-decked grounds I walked, and the aroma of rarest blooms filled
my senses with delight, yet woke no answering thrill in my bosom.
Must it not be wretchedness indeed, when the heart refuses to look
around upon blooming, vernal Nature, and answer her with a smile of
freshness?</p>
          <p>A little after daylight I re-entered the house, and found Miss Bradly
dozing in a large arm-chair, with one hand thrown-upon
<pb id="browne234" n="234"/>
the cover of the bed where lay young master's body. Dr. Mandy was
outstretched upon the lounge in a profound sleep. The long candles had
burnt very low in the sockets, and every now and then sent up that
flicker, which has been so often likened to the struggles of expiring
humanity. I extinguished them, and closed the shutters, to exclude the
morning rays that would else have stolen in to mar the rest of those who
needed sleep. Then returning to the yard, I culled a fresh bouquet and
placed it upon the breast of the dead. Gently touching Miss Bradly, I
roused her and begged that she would seek some more comfortable
quarters, whilst I watched with the body. She did so, having first
imprinted a kiss upon the brow of the heavenly sleeper.</p>
          <p>When she withdrew, I took from my apron a bundle of
freshly gathered flowers, and set about weaving fairy chains and
garlands, which I scattered in fantastic profusion over and around the
body.</p>
          <p>A beautiful custom is it to decorate the dead with fresh flowers!
There is something in the delicate, fairy-like perfume, and in the magical
shadings and formation of flowers, that make them appropriate offerings
to the dead. Strange mystical things that they are, seemingly instinct
with a new and inchoate life; breathing in their heavenly fragrance of a
hidden blessing, telling a story which our dull ears of clay can never
comprehend. Symbols of diviner being, expressions of quickening
beauty, we understand ye not. We only <hi rend="italics">feel</hi> that ye are God's richest
blessing to us, therefore we offer ye to our loved and holy dead!</p>
          <p>When the broad daylight began to beam in through the crevices of the
shutters, and noise of busy life sounded from without, the family rose.
Separately they entered the room, each turning down the spread, and
gazing tearfully upon the ghastly face. Often and often they kissed the
brow, cheek, and lips.</p>
          <p>“How lovely he was in life,” said Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>“Indeed he was, and he is now an angel,” replied Miss Tildy, with a
fresh gush of emotion.</p>
          <p>“My poor, poor boy,” said Mr. Peterkin, as he sank down on
the bed beside the body; “how proud I was of him. I allers
<pb id="browne235" n="235"/>
knowed he'd be tuck 'way from me. He was too putty an' smart an'
good fur this world. My heart wus so sot on him! yit sometimes he
almost run me crazy. I don't think it was just in Providence to take my
only boy. I could have better spared one of the gals. Oh, tain't right, no
how it can be fixed.”</p>
          <p>And thus he rambled on, perfectly unconscious of the bold
blasphemy which he was uttering with every breath he drew. To
impugn the justice of his Maker's decrees was a common practice with
him. He had so long rejoiced in power, and witnessed the uncomplaining
vassalage of slaves, that he began to regard himself as the very highest
constituted authority! This is but one of the corrupting influences of
the slave-system.</p>
          <p>That long, wearing day, with its weight of speechless grief, passed
at last. The neighbors came and went. Each praised the beauty of the
corpse, and inquired who had dressed it. At length the day closed, and
was succeeded by a lovely twilight. Another night, with its star-fretted
canopy, its queenly, slow-moving moon, its soft aromatic air and pearly
dew. And another gray, hazy day-break, yet still, as before, I watched
near the dead. But on the afternoon of this day, there came a long, black
coffin, with its silver plate and mountings; its interior trimmings of
white satin and border of lace, and within this they laid the form of
young master! His pale, fair hands were crossed prayerfully upon his
breast; and a fillet of fresh white buds bound his smooth brow, whilst a
large bouquet lay on his breast, and the wreaths I had woven were
thrown round him and over his feet. Then the lid was placed on and
tightly screwed down. Then came the friends and neighbors, and a good
man who read the Bible and preached a soothing and ennobling sermon.
The friends gave one more look, another, a longer and more clinging
kiss, then all was over. The slow procession followed after the vehicle
that carried the coffin, the servants walking behind. Poor, uncared-for
slaves, as we were, we paid a heart-felt tribute to his memory, and
watered his new-made grave with as sincere tears as ever flowed from
eyes that had looked on happier times.</p>
          <p>I lingered until long after the last shovel-full of dirt was
<pb id="browne236" n="236"/>
thrown upon him. Others, even his kindred, had left the spot ere I
turned away. That little narrow grave was dearer and nearer to me, as
there it lay so fresh and damp, shapen smoothly with the sexton's
spade, than when, several weeks after, a patrician obelisk reared its
Parian head towards the blue sky. I have always looked upon grave-monuments
as stony barriers, shutting out the world from the form that
slowly moulders below. When the wild moss and verdant sward alone
cover the grave, 'tis easy for us to imagine death only a sleep; but the
grave-stone, with its carvings and frescoes, seems a sort of prison, cold
and grim in its aristocratic splendor. For the grave of those whom I love,
I ask no other decoration than the redundant grass, the enamelled mosaic
of wild flowers, a stream rolling by with its dirge-like chime, a weeping
willow, and a moaning dove.</p>
          <p>The shades of evening were falling darkly ere I left the burial-ground.
There, amid the graves of his ancestors, beside the tomb of his mother, I
left him sleeping pleasantly. “Life's fitful fever over,” his calm soul
rests well.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>In a few weeks after his death, the family settled back to their
original manner of life. Mr. Peterkin grew sulky in his grief. He chewed
and drank incessantly. The remonstrances of his daughters had no effect
upon him. He took no notice of them, seemed almost to ignore their
existence. Feeding sullenly on his own rooted sorrow, he cared nothing
for those around him.</p>
          <p>We, the servants, had been allowed a rather better time; for as he was
entirely occupied with his own moody reflections, he bestowed upon us
no thought. Yet we had heard no word about his compliance with the
sacred promise he had made to the dead. Did he feel no touch of
remorse, or was he so entirely sold to the d—l, as to be incapable of
regret?</p>
          <p>The young ladies had been busy making up their mourning, and took
but little, notice of domestic affairs. Miss Jane concluded to postpone
her visit to the city, on account of their
<pb id="browne237" n="237"/>
recent bereavement; but later in the summer, she proposed going.</p>
          <p>One afternoon, several weeks after the burial of young master,
Miss Bradly came over to see the ladies for the purpose, as she said,
of bidding them farewell, as early on the following morning she
expected to start North, to rejoin her family, from whom she had been
so long separated. Miss Jane received the announcement with her usual
haughty smile; and Miss Tildy, who was rather more of a hypocrite,
expressed some regret at parting from her old teacher.</p>
          <p>“I fear, dear girls, that you will soon forget me. I hoped that an
intimate friendship had grown up between us, which nothing could
destroy; but it seems as if, in the last half-year, you have ceased to love
me, or care for me.”</p>
          <p>“I can only answer for myself, dear Miss Bradly,” said Miss Tildy,
“and I shall ever gratefully and fondly remember you, and my
interesting school-days.”</p>
          <p>“So shall I pleasantly recollect my school-hours, and Miss Bradly as
our preceptress; and, had she not chosen to express and defend those
awfully disgraceful and incendiary principles of the North, I should
have continued to think of her with pleasure.” Miss Jane said this with
her freezing air of hauteur.</p>
          <p>“But I remained silent, dear Jane, for years. I lived in your midst, in
the very families where slave-labor was employed; yet I molested none.
I did not inveigh against your peculiar domestic institution; though,
Heaven knows, every principle of my nature cried out against it. Surely
for all this I deserve some kind consideration.”</p>
          <p>“'Tis a great pity your prudence did not hold out to the last; and I can
assure you 'tis well for the safety of your life and person that you were
a woman, else would it have gone hard with you. Kited through the
streets with a coat of tar and a plumage of hen-feathers, you would have
been treated to a rail-ride, none the most complimentary.” Here Miss
Jane laughed heartily at the ridiculous picture she had drawn.</p>
          <p>Miss Bradly's face reddened deeply as she replied:</p>
          <pb id="browne238" n="238"/>
          <p>“And all this would have been inflicted -upon me because I dared to
have an opinion upon a subject of vital import to this our proud
Republic. This would have been the gracious hospitality, which, as
chivalry-loving Southerners, you would have shown to a stranger from
the North! If this be your mode and manner of carrying out the Comity
of States, I am heartily glad that I am about returning to the other side of
the border.”</p>
          <p>“And we give you joy of your swift return. Pray, tell all your
Abolition friends that such will be their reception, should they dare to
venture among us.”</p>
          <p>“Yet, as with tearful eyes you stood round your brother's death-bed,
you solemnly promised him that his dying wish, with regard to the
liberation of your father's slaves, should be carried out, and that you
would never become the owner of such property.”</p>
          <p>“Stop! stop!” exclaimed Miss Jane, and her face was livid with rage,
“you have no right to recur to that time. You are inhuman to introduce it
at this moment. Every one of common sense knows that brother was
too young to have formed a correct opinion upon a question of such
momentous value to the entire government; besides, a promise made to
the dying is never binding. Why should it be? We only wished to relieve
him from anxiety. Father would sell every drop of his blood before he
would grant a negro liberty. He is against it in principle. So am I.
Negroes were made to serve the whites; for that purpose only were
they created, and I am not one who is willing to thwart their Maker's
wise design.”</p>
          <p>Miss Jane imagined she had spoken quite conclusively and
displayed a vast amount of learning. She looked around for
admiration and applause, which was readily given her by her
complimentary sister.</p>
          <p>“Ah, Jane, you should have been a man, and practiced law. The
courts would have been the place for the display of your brilliant
talents.”</p>
          <p>“But the halls of legislation would not, I fear,” said Miss
<pb id="browne239" n="239"/>
Bradly, “I have had the benefit of her wise, just, and philanthropic
views.”</p>
          <p>“I should never have allowed the Abolitionists their present
weight of influence, whilst the power of speech and the strength of
action remained to me,” answered Miss Jane, very tartly.</p>
          <p>“Oh no, doubtless you would have met the Douglas in his hall, and
the lion in his den,” laughingly replied Miss Bradly.</p>
          <p>Thus the conversation was carried on, upon no very friendly terms,
until Miss Jane espied me, when she thundered out,</p>
          <p>“Leave the room, Ann, we've no use for negro company here, unless,
indeed, as I think most probable, Miss Bradly came to visit you, in
which case she had better be shown to the kitchen.”</p>
          <p>This insult roused Miss Bradly's resentment, and she rose, saying,</p>
          <p>“Young ladies, I came this evening to take a pleasant <foreign lang="fre">adieu</foreign>, little
expecting to meet with such treatment; but be it as you wish; I take
my leave;” and, with a slight inclination of the head, she departed.</p>
          <p>“Oh, she is insulted!” cried Miss Tildy.</p>
          <p>“I don't care if she is, we owe her nothing. For teaching us she was
well paid; now let her take care of herself.”</p>
          <p>“I am going after her to say I did not wish to insult her; for really,
notwithstanding her Abolition sentiments, I like her very much, and I
wish her always to like me.”</p>
          <p>So she started off and overtook Miss Bradly at the gate. The
explanation was, I presume, accepted, for they parted with kisses and
tears.</p>
          <p>That evening, when I was serving the table, Miss Jane reported the
conversation to her father, who applauded her manner of argument
greatly.</p>
          <p>“Set my niggers free, indeed! Catch me doing any such foolish thing.
I'd sooner be shot. Don't you look for anything of the kind, Ann; I'd
sooner put you in my pocket.”</p>
          <p>And this was the way he kept a sacred promise to his dead son! But
cases such as this are numerous. The negro is
<pb id="browne240" n="240"/>
lulled with promises by humane masters—promises such as those
that led the terror-stricken Macbeth on to his fearful doom. They
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Keep the word of promise to the ear,</l><l>But break it to the hope.”</l></lg></q>
How many of them are trifled with and lured on; buoyed up
from year to year with stories, which those who tell them are
resolved shall never be realized.</p>
          <p>My memory runs back now to some such wretched recollections
and my heart shrivels and crumbles at the bare thought,
like scorched paper. Oh, where is there to be found injustice
like that which the American slaves daily and hourly endure,
without a word of complaint? “We die daily”—die to love,
to hope, to feeling, humanity, and all the high and noble gifts
that make existence something more than a mere breathing span.
We die to all enlargement of mind and expansion of heart.
Our every energy is bound down with many bolts and bars;
yet whole folios have been written by men calling themselves
wise, to prove that we are by far the happiest portion of the
population of this broad Union! What a commentary upon the
liberality of free men!</p>
          <p>After the conversation with Miss Bradly, the young ladies began to
resume their old severity, which the death of young master had checked;
but Mr. Peterkin still seemed moody and troubled. He drank to a
frightful excess. It seemed to have increased his moroseness. He slept
sounder at night, and later in the morning, and was swollen and bloated
to almost twice his former dimensions. His face was a dark crimson
purple; he spoke but little, and then never without an oath. His
daughters remarked the change, but sought not to dissuade him. Perhaps
they cared not if his excesses were followed by death. I had long known
that they treated him with respect only out of apprehension that they
would be cut short of patrimonial favors. But the death of young master
had almost certainly insured them against this, and they were unusually
insolent to their
<pb id="browne241" n="241"/>
father; but this he appeared not to notice; for he was too sottishly
drunk even to heed them.</p>
          <p>The necessity of wearing black, and the custom of remaining away
from places of amusement, had forced Miss Jane to decline, or at least,
postpone her trip to the city.</p>
          <p>I shall ever remember that summer as one of unusual luxuriance. It
seemed to me, that the forests were more redundant of foliage than I had
ever before seen them. The wild flowers were gayer and brighter, and the
sky of a more glorious blue; even the little feathered songsters sang more
deliciously; and oh, the moonlight nights seemed wondrously soft and
silvery, and the hosts of stars seven times multiplied! I began to live,
again. Away through the old primeval woods I took occasionally a stolen
ramble! Whole volumes of romance I drained from the ever-affluent
library of Nature. I truly found—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Tongues in the trees; books, in the running brooks,</l><l>Sermons in stones, and good in everything.”</l></lg></q>
It is impossible to imagine how much I enjoyed those solitary walks,
few and far between as they were. I used to wonder why the ladies did
not more enjoy the luxury of frequent communion with Nature in her
loveliest haunts! Strange, is it not, how little the privileged class value
the pleasures and benefits by which they are surrounded! I would have
given ten years of my life (though considering my trouble, the sacrifice
would have been small) to be allowed to linger long beside the winding,
murmuring brook, or recline at the fountain, looking far away into the
impenetrable blue above; or to gather wild flowers at will, and toy with
their tiny leaflets! but indulgences such as these would have been
condemned and punished as indolence.</p>
          <p>I cannot now, honestly, recall a single pleasure that was allowed me,
during my long slavery to Mr. Peterkin. Then who can ask me, if I
would not rather go back into bondage than <hi rend="italics">live</hi>, aye <hi rend="italics">live</hi> (that is the
word), with the proud sense of freedom mine? I have often been asked if
the burden of finding
<pb id="browne242" n="242"/>
food and raiment for myself was not great enough to make me wish
to resign my liberty. No, a thousand times no! Let me go half-clad, and
meanly fed, but still give me the custody of my own person, without a
master to spy into and question out my up-risings and down-sittings,
and confine me like a leashed hound! Slavery in its mildest phases (of
which I have <hi rend="italics">only</hi> heard, for I've always seen it in its darker terrors)
must be unhappy. The very knowledge that you have no control over
yourself, that you are subject to the will, even whim, of another; that
every privilege you enjoy is yours only by concession, not right, must
depress and all but madden the victim. In no situation, with no flowery
disguises, can the revolting institution be made consistent with the
free-agency of man, which we all believe to be the Divine gift. We have been
and are cruelly oppressed; why may we not come out with our petition
of right, and declare ourselves independent? For this were the infant
colonies applauded; who then shall inveigh against us for a practice of
the same heroism? Every word contained in their admirable Declaration,
applies to us.</p>

            <p>THE AWFUL CONFESSION OF THE MASTER—DEATH; ITS 
COLD SOLEMNITY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>TIME passed on; Mr. Peterkin drank more and more violently. He
had grown immense in size, and now slept nearly all the day as well as
night. Dr. Mandy had told the young ladies that there was great danger
of apoplexy. I frequently saw them standing off, talking, and looking at
their father with a strange expression, the meaning of which I could not
divine; but sure I am there was no love in it, 'twas more like a surmise or
inquiry, “How long will you be here?” I would not “set down aught in
malice,” I would rather “extenuate,” yet am I bound in truth to say that
I think their father's death was an event to which they looked with
pleasure. He had not been showy enough for them, nor had he loved
such display as they wished: true, he allowed them any amount of
money; but he objected to conforming to certain fashions, which they
considered indispensable to their own position; and this difference in
ideas and tastes created much discord. They were not girls of feeling and
heart. To them, a father was nothing more than an accidental guardian,
whose duty it was to supply them with money.</p>
          <p>Late one night, when I had fallen into a profound sleep, such an one
as I had not known for months, almost years, I was suddenly aroused
by a loud knocking at the cabin-door, and a shout of—</p>
          <p>“Ann! Ann!”</p>
          <p>I instantly recognized the sharp staccato notes of Miss Jane's voice;
and, starting quickly up, I opened the door, but half-dressed, and
inquired what was wanting?</p>
          <pb id="browne244" n="244"/>
          <p>“Are you one of the Seven Sleepers, that it requires such
knocking to arouse you? Here I've been beating and banging the door,
and yet you still slept on.”</p>
          <p>I stammered out something like an excuse; and she told me master
was very ill, and I must instantly heat a large kettle of water; that Dr.
Mandy had been sent for, and upon his arrival, prescribed a hot bath.</p>
          <p>As quickly as the fire, aided by mine and Sally's united efforts, could
heat the water, it was got ready. Jake, Nace, and Dan lifted the large
bathing-tub into Mr. Peterkin's room, filled it with the warm water, and
placed him in it. The case was as Dr. Mandy had predicted. Mr. P. had
been seized with a violent attack of apoplexy, and his life was despaired
of.</p>
          <p>All the efforts of the physician seemed to fail. When Mr. Peterkin
did revive, it was frightful to listen to him. Such revolting oaths as he
used! Such horrid blasphemy as poured from his lips, I shrink from the
foulness of recording.</p>
          <p>Raving like a madman, he called upon God to restore his son, or stand
condemned as unjust. His daughters, in sheer affright, sent for the
country preacher; but the good man could effect nothing. His pious
words were wasted upon ears duller than stone.</p>
          <p>“I don't care a d—n for your religion. None of your hypocritical
prayin' round me,” Mr. Peterkin would say, when the good parson
sought to beguile his attention, and lead him to the contemplation of
divine things.</p>
          <p>Frightful it was, to me, to stand by his bed-side, and hear him call
with an oath for whiskey, which was refused.</p>
          <p>He had drunk so long, and so deeply, that now, when he was
suddenly checked, the change was terrible to witness. He grew timid,
and seemed haunted by terrible spectres. Anon he would call to some
fair-haired woman, and shout out that there was blood, clotted blood, on
her ringlets; then, rolling himself up in the bed covering, he would shriek
for the skies and mountains to hide him from the meek reproach of
those girlish eyes!</p>
          <pb id="browne245" n="245"/>
          <p>“Something terrible is on his memory,” said the doctor to Miss Jane?
“Do you know aught of this?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing,” she replied with a shudder.</p>
          <p>“Don't you remember,” asked Miss Tildy, “how often Johnny's eyes
seemed to recall a remorseful memory, and how father would, as now, cry
for them to shut out that look which so tormented him?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes,” and they both fled from the room, and did not again go
near their father. On the third evening of his illness, when Dr. Mandy
(who had been constantly with him) sat by his bed, holding his pulse,
<sic corr="he">`</sic> turned on his side, and asked in a mild tone, quite unusual to him,</p>
          <p>“Doctor, must I die? Tell me the truth; I don't want to be deceived.”</p>
          <p>After a moment's pause, the doctor replied, “Yes, Mr. Peterkin, I
will speak the truth; I don't think you can recover from this attack, and,
if I am not very much mistaken, but a few hours of mortal life now
remain to you.”</p>
          <p>“Then I must speak on a matter what has troubled me a good deal. If
I was a good scholar I'd a writ it out, and left it fur you to read; but as I
warn't much edicated, I couldn't do that, so I'll jist tell you all, and
relieve my mind.” Here Mr. Peterkin's face assumed a frightful
expression; his eyes rolled terribly in his head, and blazed with an
expression which no language can paint. His very hair seemed erect with
terror.</p>
          <p>“Don't excite yourself; be calm! Wait until another time, then tell
me.”</p>
          <p>“No, no, I must speak now, I feel it 'twill do me good. Long time ago
I had a good kind mother, and one lovely sister;” and here his voice sank
to a whisper. “My father I can't remember; he died when I was a baby. I
was a wild boy; a ‘brick,’ as they usin' to call me. 'Way off in old
Virginny I was born and raised. My mother was a good, easy sort of
woman, that never used any force with her children, jist sich a person as
should raise gals, not fit to manage onruly boys like
<pb id="browne246" n="246"/>
me. I jist had my own way; came and went when I pleased.
Mother didn't often reprove me; whenever she did, it was in a
gentle sort of way that I didn't mind at all. I'd promise far enough;
but then, I'd go and do my own way. So I growed up to the age
of eighteen. I'd go off on little trips; get myself
in debt, and mother'd have to pay. She an' sis had to take in
sewin' to support 'emselves, and me too. Wal, they didn't make
money fast enough at this; so they went out an' took in washin'.
Sis, poor little thing, hired herself out by the
day, to get extry money for to buy knic-nacs fur mother,
whose health had got mighty bad. Wal, their rent had fell
due, and Lucy (my sister) and mother had bin savin' up money
far a good while, without sayin' anything to me 'bout it; but,
of nights when they thought I was asleep, I seed 'em slip the
money in a drawer of an old bureau, that stood in the room
whar I slept. Wal, I owed some men a parcel of money,
gamblin' debts, and they had bin sorter quarrelin' with me
'bout it, and railin' of me 'bout my want of spirit, and I was
allers sort of proud an' very high-tempered. So I 'gan to
think mother and Luce was a saving up money fur to buy
finery fur 'emselves, an' I 'greed I'd fix 'em fur it. So one
night I made my brags to the boys that I'd pay the next
night, with intrust. Some of 'em bet big that I wouldn't do it.
So then I was bound fur it. Accordin', next night I tried to
get inter the drawer; but found it fast locked. I tried agin.
At length, with a wrinch, I bust it open, an' thar before me, all
in bright specie, lay fifty dollars! A big sum it 'peared to
me, and then I was all afired with passion, for Luce had
refused me when I had axed her to lend me money. Jist as I
had pocketed it, an' was 'about to drive out of the room, Lucy
opened the door, an' seein' the drawer wide open, she guessed
it all. She gave one loud scream, saying, ‘Oh, all our hard
savin's is gone.’ I made a sign to her to keep silent; but she
went on hallowin' and cotcht hold of me, an' by a sort of quare
strength, she got her arm round me, an' her hand in my pocket,
where the money was”</p>
          <pb id="browne247" n="247"/>
          <p>“You musn't have this, indeed you musn't,” said she, “for it
is to pay our rent.”</p>
          <p><corr>“</corr>One desperate effort I made, an' knocked her to the floor.
Her head struck agin the sharp part of the bureau, and the
blood gushed from it; I give one loud yell for mother, an' then
fled. Give me some water,” he added in a hollow tone.</p>
          <p>After moistening his lips, he continued:</p>
          <p>“Reachin' my companions, I paid down every cent of the
money, principal and interest, then got my bet paid, and left
'em, throwin' a few dollars toward 'em for the gineral treat.</p>
          <p>“About midnight, soft as a cat, I crept along to our house;
and I knew from the light through the open shutter of the winder,
that she was either dead or dyin'; for it was a rule at our 
house put out afore ten.</p>
          <p>“I slipped up close to the winder, and lookin' in, saw the
very wust that I had expected—Lucy in her shroud! A long,
white sheet was spread over the body! Two long candles burnt
at the head and foot of the corpse. Three neighbor-women was
watchin' with her. While I still looked, the side door opened,
and mother came in, looking white as a ghost. She turned down
the sheet from the body. I pressed my face still closer to the
winder-pane; and saw the white, dead face; the forehead,
where the wound had been given, was bandaged up. Mother
knelt down, and cried out with a tone that froze my blood—</p>
          <p>“ ‘My child, my murdered child!’ I did not tarry another
minute; but with one loud yell bounded away. This scream
roused the women, who seized up the candle and run out to the
door. I looked back an' saw them with candles in hand,
examining round the house. For weeks I lived in the woods on
herbs and nuts; occasionally stoppin' at farm-houses, an' buyin'
a leetle milk and bread, still I journeyed on toward the West,
my land of promise. At last, on foot, after long travel, I reached
Kaintuck. I engaged in all sorts of head-work, but did'nt
succeed very well till I began to trade in niggers; then I made
money fast enough. I was a hard master. It seemed like I
was the same as that old Ishmael you read of in the old book;
<pb id="browne248" n="248"/>
my hand was agin every man, and every man's agin me. After while, I
got mighty rich from tradin' in niggers, and married. These is my
children. This is all of my story,—a bad one 'tis too; but, doctor, that
boy, my poor, dead Johnny, was so like Lucy that he almost driv' me
mad. At times he had a sartin look, jist like hern, that driv' a dagger to
my heart. Oh, Lord! if I die, what will become of me? Give me some
whiskey, doctor, I mus' have some, for the devil and all his imps seem
to be here.”</p>
          <p>He began raving in a frightful manner, and sprang out of bed so
furiously that the doctor deemed it necessary to have him confined.
Jake, Dan, and Nace were called in to assist in tying their master. It was
with difficulty they accomplished their task; but at last it was done.
Panting and foaming at the mouth, this Goliath of human abominations
lay! He, who had so often bound negroes, was now by them bound
down! If he had been fully conscious, his indignation would have
known no limits.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane sent for me to come to her room. I found her in hysterics.
Immediately, at her command, I set about rubbing
her head, and chafing her temples and bands with cologne; but all that I
could do seemed to fall far short of affording any relief. It appeared to
me that her lungs were unusually strong, for such screams I hardly ever
listened to; but her life was stout enough to stand it. The wicked are
long-lived!</p>
          <p>Miss Tildy had more self-control. She moved about the house with
her usual indifference, caring for and heeding no one, except as she
bestowed upon me an occasional reprimand, which, to this day, I cannot
think I deserved. If she mislaid an article of apparel, she instantly
accused me of having stolen it; and persisted in the charge until it was
found. She always accompanied her accusations with impressive blows.
It is treatment such as this that robs the slave of all self-respect. He is
constantly taught to look upon himself as an animal, devoid of all good
attributes, without principle, and full of vice. If he really tries to
practice virtue and integrity, he gets no
<pb id="browne249" n="249"/>
credit for it. “<hi rend="italics">Honest for a nigger,</hi>” is a phrase much in use in Kentucky
the satirical significance of which is perfectly
understood by the astute African. I knew that it was hard for me to
hold fast to my principles amid such fierce trials. It was so common a
charge—that of liar and thief—that despite my
practice to the contrary, I almost began to accept the terms as deserved.
In some cases, the human conscience is a flexile thing! but, thank
Heaven! mine withstood the trial!</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>On the morning of the fifth day after Mr. Peterkin's illness,
his perturbed spirit, amid imprecations and blasphemies the most
horrible, took its leave of the mortal tenement. Whither went it, oh, angel
of mercy? A fearful charge had his guardian-angel to render up.</p>
          <p>This was the second time I had witnessed the death of a
human master. I had no tears; and, as a veracious historian, I am bound
to say that I regard it as a beneficent dispensation
of Divine Providence. He, my tyrant, had gone to his Judge to render a
fearful account of the dreadful deeds done in the body.</p>
          <p>After he was laid out and appropriately dressed, and the room
darkened, the young ladies came in to look at him. I believe they wept.
At least, I can testify to the premonitory symptoms of weeping,
viz., the fluttering of white pocket-handkerchiefs, in
close proximity to the eyes! The neighbors gathered round them with
bottles of <foreign lang="fre">sal-volatile</foreign>, camphor, fans, &amp;c., &amp;c. There was no dearth of
consolatory words, for they were rich.
Though Mr. Peterkin's possessions were vast, he could carry no tithe
of them to that land whither he had gone; and at that bar before which
he must stand, there would flash on him the
stern eye of Justice. His trial there would be equitable and rigid. His
money could avail him nought; for <hi rend="italics">there</hi> were allowed no “packed
juries,” bribed and suborned witnesses, no wily attorneys to turn Truth
astray; no subtleties and quibbles of litigation; all is clear, straight,
open, even-handed justice, and his own deeds, like a mighty cloud of
evidence,
<pb id="browne250" n="250"/>
would rise up against him—and so we consign him to his fate
and to his mother earth.</p>
          <p>But he was befittingly buried, even with the rites of
Christianity! There was a man in a white neck-cloth, with a sombre
face, who read a psalm, offered up a well-worded prayer, gave
out a text, and therefrom preached an appropriate, elegiac sermon.
Not one, to be sure, in which the peculiar virtues of brother
Peterkin were set forth, but a sort of pious oration, wherein
religion, practical and revealed, was duly encouraged, and
great sympathy offered to the <hi rend="italics">lovely</hi> and bereaved daughters, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The body was placed in a very fine coffin, and interred in the family
burying-ground, near his wife and son! At the grave, Miss
Jane, who well understood scenic effect, contrived to get up an attack of
syncope, and fell prostrate beside the new-made grave. Of course “the
friends” gathered round her with restoratives, and, shouting for “air,”
they made an opening in the crowd, through which she was borne to a
carriage and driven home.</p>
          <p>I had lingered, tenderly, beside young master's tomb, little heeding
what was passing around, when this theatrical excitement roused me.
Oh! does not one who has real trouble, heart-agony, sicken when he
hears of these affectations of grief?</p>
          <p>Slowly, but I suspect with right-willing hearts, the crowd turned
away from the grave, each betaking himself to his own home and
pursuit.</p>
          <p>A few weeks after, a stately monument, commemorative of his good
deeds, was erected to the memory of James Peterkin.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>WEEKS rolled monotonously by after the death of Mr. Peterkin.
There was nothing to break the cloud of gloom that
enveloped everything.</p>
          <p>The ladies were, as ever, cruel and abusive. Existence became more
painful to me than it had been before. It seemed as if every hope was
dead in my breast. An iron chain bound every aspiration, and I settled
down into the lethargy of despair. Even Nature, all radiant as she is, had
lost her former charms. I looked not beyond the narrow horizon of the
present. The future held out to me no allurements, whilst the dark and
gloomy past was an arid plain, without fountain, or flower, or sunshine,
over which I dared not send my broken spirit.</p>
          <p>In this state of dreary monotony, I passed my life for months, until
an event occurred which changed my whole after-fate.</p>
          <p>Mr. Summerville, who, it seems, had kept up a regular
correspondence with Miss Jane, made us a visit, and, after much secret
talking in dark parlors, long rambles through the woods,
twilight and moonlight whisperings on the gallery, Miss Jane
announced that there would, on the following evening, be performed a
marriage ceremony of importance to all, but of very particular interest
to Mr. Summerville and herself.</p>
          <p>Accordingly, on the evening mentioned, the marriage rite was
solemnized in the presence of a few social friends, among whom Dr.
Mandy and wife shone conspicuously. I duly plied the guests with
wine, cakes and confections.</p>
          <p>Miss Tildy, by the advice of her bride-sister, enacted the
<pb id="browne252" n="252"/>
pathetic very perfectly. She wept, sighed, and, I do believe, fainted or
tried to faint. This was at the special suggestion of her sister, who duly
commended and appreciated her.</p>
          <p>Mr. Summerville, for the several days that he remained with us,
looked, and was, I suppose, the very personification of delight.</p>
          <p>In about a week or ten days after the solemnization of the
matrimonial rite, Mr. Summerville made his “better half” (or worse, I
know not which), understand that very important business urged his
immediate return to the city. Of course, whilst the novelty of the
situation lasted, she was as obedient and complaisant as the most
exacting husband could demand, and instantly consented to her lord's
request. She bade me get ready to accompany her; and, as she had heard
that people from the country were judged according to the wardrobe of
their servants, she prepared for me quite a decent outfit.</p>
          <p>One bright morning, I shall ever remember it, we started off with
innumerable trunks, band-boxes, &amp;c.—for the city of L—. Without one
feeling of regret, I turned my face from the Peterkin farm. I never saw it
after, save in dark and fearful dreams, from which I always awoke with a
shudder. I felt half-emancipated, when my back was turned against it,
and in the distance loomed up the city and freedom. I had a queer fancy,
that if the Peterkin influence were once thrown off, the rest would
speedily succeed!</p>
          <p>If I had only been allowed, I could have shouted out like a school-boy
freed from a difficult lesson; but Miss Jane's checking glance was upon
me, and 'twas like winter's frozen breath over a gladsome lake.</p>
          <p>I well remember the beautiful ride upon the boat, and how long and
lingeringly I gazed over the guard, looking down at the blue, dolphin-like
waves. All the day, whilst others lounged and talked, I was looking at
those same curling, frothy billows, making, in my own mind, fifty
fantastic comparisons, which then appeared to me very brilliant, but,
since I have learned to think differently. Truly, the foam has died on
the wave.</p>
          <pb id="browne253" n="253"/>
          <p>When night came on, wrapped in her sombre purple, yet glittering
with a cuirass of stars and a helmet of planets, the waters sparkled and
danced with a fairy-like beauty, and I thought I had never beheld anything
half so ecstatic! There was none on that crowded steamer who dreamed
of the glory that was nestling, like a thing of love, deep and close down
in the poor slave's breast!</p>
          <p>To those who surrounded me, this was but an ordinary sight; to me it
was one of strange, unimagined loveliness. I was careful,
however, to disguise my emotions. I would have given worlds (had I
been their possessor) to speak my joy in one wild word,
or to shout it forth in a single cry.</p>
          <p>This pleasure, like all others, found its speedy end. The next
morning, about ten o'clock, we landed in L—, a city of some commercial
consequence in the West. Indeed, by old residents of the interior of
Kentucky, it is regarded as “<hi rend="italics">the city.</hi>” I have often since thought of my
first landing there; of its dusty, dirty coal-besmoked appearance; of its
hedge of drays, its knots of garrulous and noisy drivers, and then the
line of dusky warehouses, storage rooms, &amp;c. All this instantly rises to
my mind when I hear that growing city spoken of.</p>
          <p>Mr. Summerville engaged one of the neatest-looking coaches at the
wharf; and into it Miss Jane, baggage and servant were unceremoniously
hurried. I had not the privilege and scarcely the wish to look out of the
coach-window, yet, from my crowded and uncomfortable position, I
could catch a sight of an occasional ambitious barber's pole, or myriad-tinted
chemists' bottles; all these, be it remembered, were novelties to
me, who had never been ten miles from Mr. Peterkin's farm. At length
the driver drew a halt at the G— House, as Mr. Summerville had
directed, and, at this palatial-looking building Mr. Summerville had taken
quarters. How well I recollect its wide hall, its gothic entrance and
hospitable-looking vestibule! The cane-colored floor cloth,
corresponding with the oaken walls, struck me as the harmonious design
of an artistic mind.</p>
          <p>For a few moments only was Miss Jane left in the neat
<pb id="browne254" n="254"/>
reception-room, when a nice-looking mulatto man entered, and, in a low,
gentlemanly tone, informed her that her room was ready. Taking the
basket and portmanteau from me, he politely requested that we would
follow him to room No. 225. Through winding corridors and
interminable galleries, he conducted us, until, at last, we reached it.
Drawing a key from his pocket, he applied it to the lock, and bade Miss
Jane enter. She was much pleased with the arrangement of the furniture,
the adjustment of the drapery, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>The floor was covered with a beautiful green velvet carpet, torn
bouquet pattern, whilst the design of the rug was one that well
harmonized with the disposition of the present tenant. It was a wild
tiger reposing in his native jungle.</p>
          <p>After Miss Jane had made an elaborate toilette, she told me, as a great
favor, she would allow me to go down stairs, or walk through the halls
for recreation, as she had no further use for me.</p>
          <p>I wandered about, passing many rooms, all numbered in gilt figures.
The most of them had their doors open, and I amused myself watching
the different expressions of face and manners
of their occupants. This had always been a habit of mine, for the
indulgence of which, however, I had had but little opportunity.</p>
          <p>I strayed on till I reached the parlors, and they burst upon me with the
necromantic power of Aladdin's hall. A continuity of four apartments
rolled away into a seeming mist, and the adroit position of a mirror
multiplied their number and added greatly to the gorgeous effect. There
were purple and golden curtains, with their many tinsel ornaments;
carpets of the gayest style, from the richest looms. “Etruscan vases,
quaint and old” adorned the mantel-shelf, and easy divans and lounges
of mosaic-velvet were ranged tastefully around. An arcade, with its
stately pillars, divided two of the rooms, and the inter-columniations
were ornamented with statues and statuettes; and upon a marble table,
in the centre of one of the apartments, was a blooming magnolia, the
first one I had ever seen! That strange and
<pb id="browne255" n="255"/>
mysterious odor, that, like a fine, inner, sub-sense, pervades the
nerve with a quickening power, stole over me! I stood before
the flower in a sort of delicious, delirious joy. There, with its
huge fan-like leaves of green, this pure white blossom, queen
of all the tribe of flowers, shed its glorious perfume and 
unfolded its mysterious beauty. It seemed that a new life was
opening upon me. Surely, I said this <hi rend="italics">is</hi> fairy land. For more
than an hour I lingered beside, that splendid magnolia, vainly essaying
to drink in its glory and its mystery.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane and Mr. Summerville had gone out to take a drive over the
city, and I was comparatively free, in their absence to go whithersoever
I pleased.</p>
          <p>Whilst I still loitered near the flower, a very sweet but manly
voice asked:</p>
          <p>“Do you love flowers?”</p>
          <p>I turned hastily, and to my surprise, beheld a fine-looking gentleman
standing in close contiguity to me. With pleasure
I think now of his broad, open face, written all over with love and
kindness; his deep, fervid blue eye, that wore such a gentle expression;
and the scant, yet fair hair that rolled away
from his magnificent forehead! He appeared to be slightly upwards of
fifty; but I am sure from his face, that those fifty years had been most
nobly spent.</p>
          <p>I trembled as I replied:</p>
          <p>“Yes, I am very fond of flowers.”</p>
          <p>He noticed my embarrassment, and smiled most benignantly.</p>
          <p>“Did you ever see a magnolia before?”</p>
          <p>“Is this a magnolia?” I inquired, pointing to the luxurious flower.</p>
          <p>“Yes, and one of the finest I ever saw. It belongs to the
South. Are you sure you never saw one before?” He fixed
his eyes inquiringly upon me as I answered:</p>
          <p>“Oh, quite sure, sir; I never was ten miles from my master's
farm in my life.”</p>
          <p>“You are a slave?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir. I am.”</p>
          <pb id="browne256" n="256"/>
          <p>He waited a moment, then said:</p>
          <p>“Are you happy?”</p>
          <p>I dared not tell a falsehood, yet to have truly stated my feelings,
would have been dangerous; so I evasively replied:</p>
          <p>“Yes, as much so as most slaves.”</p>
          <p>I thought I heard him sigh, as he slowly moved away.</p>
          <p>My eyes followed him with inquiring wonder. Who could he be?
Certain I was that no malice had prompted the question he had asked
me. The circumstance created anxiety in my mind. All that day as I
walked about, or waited on Miss Jane, that stranger's faces hone like a
new-risen moon upon my darkened heart. Had I found, accidentally, one
of those Northern Abolitionists, about whom I had heard so much?
Often after when sent upon errands for my mistress, I met him in the
halls, and he always gave me a kind smile and a friendly salutation. Once
Miss Jane observed this, and instantly accused me of having a
dishonorable acquaintance with him. My honor was a thing that I had
always guarded with the utmost vigilance, and to such a serious charge I
perhaps made some hasty reply, whereupon Miss Jane seized a riding-whip,
and cut me most severely across the face, leaving an ugly mark, a
trace of which I still bear, and suppose I shall carry to my grave. Mr.
Summerville expostulated with his wife, saying that it was better to use
gentle means at first.</p>
          <p>“No, husband,” (she always thus addressed him,) “I know more
about the management of <hi rend="italics">niggers</hi> than you do.”</p>
          <p>This gross pronunciation of the word negro has a popular use even
among the upper and educated classes of Kentucky. I am at a loss to
account for it, in any other way than by supposing that they use it to
express their deepest contempt.</p>
          <p>Mr. Summerville was rather disposed to be humane to his servants.
He was no advocate of the rod; he used to term it the relic of barbarism.
He preferred selling a refractory servant to whipping him. This did not
accord particularly well with Miss Jane's views, and the consequence
was they
<pb id="browne257" n="257"/>
had many a little private argument that did not promise to end
well.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane made many acquaintances among the hotel, with whom
she was much pleased. She had frequent invitations to attend the
theatre, concerts, and even parties. Many of the fashionables of the city
called upon her, offering, in true Kentucky style, the hospitalities of
their mansions. With this she was quite delighted, and her new life
became one of intense interest and gratification, as her letters to her
sister proved.</p>
          <p>She would often regret Tildy was not there to share in her
delight; but it had been considered best for her to remain at
the old homestead until some arrangement could be made about
the division of the estate. Two of the neighbors, a gentleman
and his wife, took up their abode with her; but she expected to
visit the city so soon as Miss Jane went to house-keeping,
which would be in a few months. Miss Jane was frequently out
spending social days and evenings with her friends, thus giving
me the opportunity of going about more than I had ever done
through the house. In this way I formed a pleasant acquaintance
with several of the chambermaids, colored girls and free. Friendships
thus grew up which have lasted ever since, and will continue,
I trust, until death closes over us. One of the girls,
Louise, a half-breed, was an especial favorite. She had read
some, and was tolerably well educated. From her I often borrowed
interesting books, compends of history, bible-stories,
poems, &amp;c. I also became a furious reader of newspapers, thus
picking up, occasionally, much useful information. Louise introduced
me, formally, to the head steward, an intelligent
mulatto man, named Henry, of most prepossessing appearance; but
the shadow of a great grief lurked in the full look of his large
dark eye! “I am a slave, God help me!” seemed stamped
upon his face; 'twas but seldom that I saw him smile, and then
it was so like the reflection of a tear, that it pained me full as
much as his sigh. He had access to the gentlemen's reading-room and
through him I often had the opportunity of
<pb id="browne258" n="258"/>
reading the leading Anti-slavery journals. With what avidity I devoured
them! How full they were of the noblest philanthropy! Great
exponents of real liberty! at the words of your argument my heart
leaped like a new-fledged bird! Still pour forth your burning eloquence;
it will yet blaze like a watchfire on the Mount of Liberty! The gladness,
the hope, the faith it imparted to my long-bowed heart, would, I am
sure, give joy to those noble leaders of the great cause.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>THE ARGUMENT.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ONE day, when Miss Jane and Mr. Summerville had gone out at an
early hour to spend the entire day, I little knew what to do with myself
as I had no books nor papers to read, and Louise had business that took
her out of the house.</p>
          <p>The day was unusually soft and pleasant. I wandered through the
halls, and, drawing near a private gallery that ran along in front of the
gentlemen's room, I paused to look at a large picture of an English
fox-chase, that adorned the wall. Whist examining its rare and peculiar
beauties, my ear was pleasantly struck by the sound of a
much-esteemed voice, saying—</p>
          <p>“Well, very well! Let us take seats here, in this retired place, and
begin the conversation we have been threatening so long.”</p>
          <p>I glanced out at the crevice of the partially open door, and distinctly
recognized the gentleman who had spoken to me of the magnolia, and
who (I had learned) was James Trueman, of Boston, a man of high
standing and social position, and a successful practitioner of law in his
native State.</p>
          <p>The other was a gentleman from Virginia, one of the very first
families (there are no second, I believe), by the name of Winston, a man
reputed of very vast possessions, a land-holder, and an extensive owner
of slaves. I had frequently observed him in company with Mr.
Trueman, and had inquired of Henry who and what he was.</p>
          <p>I felt a little reluctant to remain in my position and bear this
conversation, not designed for me; yet a singular impulse urged
<pb id="browne260" n="260"/>
me to remain. I felt (and I scarce know why) that it had a bearing upon
the great moral and social question that so agitated the country. Whilst I
was debating with myself about the propriety of a retreat, I caught a
few words, which determined me to stay and hear what I believed
would prove an interesting discussion.</p>
          <p>“Let us, my dear Mr. Winston,” began Mr. Trueman, “indulge for a
few moments in a conversation upon this momentous subject. Both of
us have passed that time of life when the ardor and impetuosity of
youthful blood might unfit us for such a discussion, and we may say
what we please on this vexed question with the distinct understanding,
that however offensive our language may become, it will be regarded as
<hi rend="italics">general</hi>, neither meant nor understood to have any application to
ourselves.”</p>
          <p>“I am quite willing and ready to converse as you propose,” replied
the other, in a quick, unpleasant tone, “and I gladly accept the terms
suggested, in which you only anticipate my design. It is well to agree
upon such restraint; for though, as you remind me, our advancing years
have taken much of the fervor from our blood, and left us calm, sober,
thoughtful men, the agitating nature of the subject and the deep interest
which both of us feel in it, should put us on our guard. If, then, during
the progress of the conversation, either of us shall be unduly excited, let
the recollection of the conditions upon which we engage in it, recall him
to his accustomed good-humor.”</p>
          <p>“Well, we have settled the preliminaries without difficulty, and to
mutual satisfaction. And now, the way being clear, our discussion may
proceed. I assume, then, in the outset, that the, institution of slavery,
as it exists in the South, is a monstrous evil. I assume this proposition;
not alone because it is the universal sentiment of the ‘rest of mankind;’
but also, because it is now very generally conceded by slave-holders
themselves.”</p>
          <p>“Pray, where did you learn that slave-holders ever made such a
concession? As to what may be the sentiment of the, ‘rest of
mankind,’ I may speak by-and-bye. For the present, my
concern is with the opinion of that large slave-holding class to
<pb id="browne261" n="261"/>
which I belong. I am extensively acquainted among them, and if that is
their opinion of our peculiar institution, I am entirely ignorant of it.”</p>
          <p>“Your ignorance,” said Mr. Trueman, with a smile, “ in that regard,
while it by no means disproves my proposition, may be easily
explained. With your neighbors, who feel like yourself the dread
responsibility of this crying abomination, it is not pleasant, perhaps, to
talk upon it, and you avoid doing so, without the slightest trouble;
because you have other and more engaging topics, such as the condition
of your farms, the prospect of fine crops, and all the ‘changes of the
varying year.’ But, read the declarations of your chosen
Representatives, the favorite sons of the South, in the high councils of
our nation; and you will discover, that in all the debates involving it,
slavery, in itself, and in its consequences, is frankly admitted to be a
tremendous evil.”</p>
          <p>“Our Representatives may have sometimes thought proper to
make such an admission to appease the fanaticism of Northern
Abolitionists, and to quiet the agitations of the country in the spirit of
generous compromise: but <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am not bound to make it, and <hi rend="italics">I will not
make it</hi>. Neither do I avoid conversations with my neighbors upon the
subject of slavery from the motive you intimate, nor from any other
motive. I have frequently talked with them upon it, boldly and
candidly, as I am prepared to talk to you or any reasonable man. Your
proposition I positively deny, and can quickly refute.” I thought there
was a little anger in the tone in which he said this; but no excitement
was discernible in the clear, calm voice with which Mr. Trueman
answered—</p>
          <p>“Independently of the admission of your Representatives, which, I
think, ought to bind you (for you must have been aware of it, and since
it was public and undisputed, your acquiescence might be fairly
presumed), there are many considerations that establish the truth of my
position. But I cannot indorse your harsh reflection upon the
Representatives of your choice. I cannot believe them capable of
admitting, for
<pb id="browne262" n="262"/>
any purpose, a proposition which, in their opinion and that of their
constituents, asserts a falsehood. The immortal Henry Clay and such
men as he are responsible for the admission, and not one of them was
ever so timid as to be under the dominion of fear, or so dishonest as to
be hypocritical.”</p>
          <p>A moment's pause ensued, when Mr. Winston appeared to rally, and
said,</p>
          <p>“I do not understand, then, if that was their real opinion, how it was
possible for them to continue to hold slaves. To say the least of it, their
practice was not in accordance with their theory. Hence I said, that
under certain circumstances and to serve a special purpose, they may
have conceded slavery to be an evil. For my own part, if I were
persuaded that this proposition is true, it would constrain me to liberate
all my slaves, whatever may be my attachment to them or the loss I
should necessarily suffer. Some of them have been acquired by
purchase; others by inheritance: all of them seem satisfied with their
treatment upon my estate; yet nothing could induce me to claim the
property I have hitherto thought I possessed in them, when convinced
of the evil which your proposition asserts.”</p>
          <p>“Nothing could be fairer, my dear Mr. Winston. Your conviction
will doubtless subject you to immense sacrifices: but these will only
enhance your real worth as a man, and I am sure you will make them
without hesitation, though it may be, not without reluctance. Now, it is
a principle of law, well settled, that no person can in any manner
convey a title, even to those things which are property, greater than
that which be rightfully possesses. If, for instance, I acquire, by theft or
otherwise, unlawful possession of your watch or other articles of value,
which is transferred, by the operation of purchase and sale, through
many hands, your right never ceases; and the process of law will enable
you to obtain possession. Each individual who purchased the article,
may have his remedy against him from whom he procured it, however
extended the series of purchasers: but, since whatever right any one of
them
<pb id="browne263" n="263"/>
has derived originally from me, and since my unlawful acquisition
conferred no right at all, it follows that none was
transmitted. Consequently, you were not divested, and the just spirit of
law, continuing to recognize your property in the article whenever
found, provides the ready means whereby you may
reduce it once more to possession. This principle of law is not peculiar
to a single locality; it enters into the remedial code of all civilized
countries. Its benefits are accessible to the free negro in this land of the
dark Southern border; and, I trust, it will not be long before those who
are now held in slavery may be embraced in its beneficent operation.
Whether it is recognized internationally, I am not fully prepared to say;
but it ought to be, if it is not, for it is the dictate of equity and
common sense. But, upon the hypothesis that it is so recognized,
if the property of an inhabitant of Africa were stolen from him
by a citizen of the United States, he might recover it. As for
those people who, in the Southern States, are held as slaves,
they or their ancestors came here originally not by their own choice,
but by compulsion, from distant Africa. You will hardly deny, I
presume, what is, historically, so evident—that, “they were captured,”
as the phrase is, or, in our honest vernacular, <hi rend="italics">stolen</hi> and
brought by violence from their native homes. Had they been the proper
subjects of property, what could prevent the application of the
principle I have quoted?”</p>
          <p>After two or three hems and haws, Mr. Winston began:</p>
          <p>“I have never inquired particularly into the matter; but have always
entertained the impression which pervades the Southern
mind, that our negroes are legitimately our slaves, in pursuance of the
malediction denounced by God against Ham and his descendants, of
whom they are a part. And, so thinking, I believed we were entitled to
the same right to them which we exercise over the beasts of the field, the
fowls of the air, and the fishes of the deep. Moreover, your principle of
law, which is indeed very correct, is inapplicable to their case. There is
also a principle in the law of my State, incapacitating slaves to hold
property. They are property themselves; and property
<pb id="browne264" n="264"/>
cannot hold property. Apart from the terrible curse, which doomed them in
the beginning, they were slaves in their own country to men of their own
race; slaves by right of conquest. Therefore, taking the instance you have
suggested, by way of illustration, were any article of value wrested from
their possession, under this additional principle, the law could riot give
them any redress. But, inasmuch as whatever they may acquire becomes
immediately the property of their master,
to him the law will furnish a remedy.”</p>
          <p>“You do not deny,” and here Mr. Trueman's tone was elevated and
a little excited, “that the first of those who reached this country were
stolen in Africa. Now, for the sake of the argument merely, I will admit
that they were slaves at home. If they were slaves at home—it matters
not whether by ‘right or conquest,’ or ‘in pursuance of <hi rend="italics">the</hi> curse,’ they must have been the property of somebody, and those who stole them and
sold them into bondage in America could give no valid title to their
purchasers; for by the theft they had acquired none themselves. Hence,
if ever they were slaves, they are still the property of their masters in
Africa; but, if your interpretation of “the curse” is correct, those
masters were also slaves, and, being such, under the principle of law
which you have quoted, they could not for this reason hold property.
Therefore, those oppressed and outraged, though benighted people, who
were first sold into slavery, to the eternal disgrace of our land, were, in
sheer justice, either <hi rend="italics">free</hi>, or the property—even after the sale of—their
African masters, if they had any; in neither case could they belong to
those of our citizens who were unfortunate enough to buy them. They
were not slaves of African masters: for, according to your argument, all
of the race are slaves, and slaves cannot own slaves any more than
horses can own horses; therefore, since no other people claimed
dominion over them, they were, necessarily, free. You cannot escape
from this dilemma, and the choice of either horn is fatal to your cause.
Being free, might they not have held property like other
<pb id="browne265" n="265"/>
nations? And, had any of it been stolen from them by those who are
amenable to our laws, would not consistency compel us, who recognize
the just principle I have quoted, to restore it to them? This is the
course pursued among ourselves; and it ceases not with restoration;
but on the offender it proceeds to inflict punishment, to prevent a
repetition of the offence. This is the course we should pursue toward
that down-trodden race whose greatest guilt is ‘a skin not colored like
our own.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“As the case stands, it is not a question of property, but of that more
valuable and sacred right, the right of <hi rend="italics">personal liberty</hi>, of which we now
boast so loudly. What, in the estimation of the world, is the worth of
those multitudinous orations, apostrophies to liberty, which, on each
recurring Fourth of July, in whatever quarter of the globe Americans
may be assembled, penetrate the public ear? What are they worth to us,
if, while reminding us of early colonial and revolutionary struggles
against the galling tyranny of the British crown, they fail to inculcate the
easy lesson of respect for the rights of all mankind? In keeping those
poor Africans in the South still enslaved, you practically ignore this
lesson, and you trample with unholy feet that divine ordinance which
commands you ‘to do unto others as you would have others do unto
you.’ By the oppression to which we were subjected under the yoke of
Britain, and against which we wrestled so long, so patiently, so
vigorously, in so many ways, and at last so triumphantly, I adjure you
to put an end, at once and forever, to this business of holding slaves.
This is oppression indeed, in comparison with which, that which drew
forth our angry and bitter complaints, was very freedom. Let us, instead
of perpetuating this infamous institution, be true to ourselves; let us
vindicate the pretensions we set up when we characterize ours as ‘the
land of liberty, the asylum of the oppressed,’ by proclaiming to the
nations of the earth that, so soon as a slave touches the soil of America,
his manacles shall fall from him: let us verify the words engraven in
enduring brass on the old bell which from the tower of Independence
Hall rang out our glorious Declaration, and in deed and in truth
<pb id="browne266" n="266"/>
proclaim ‘Liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison doors to
them that are bound.’ As you value truth, honor, justice, consistency,
aye, humanity even, wipe out the black blot which defiles the border of
our escutcheon, and the country will then be in reality what is now
only in name, a <hi rend="italics">free</hi> country, loving liberty disinterestedly for its own
sake, and for that of all people, and nations, and tribes, and tongues.</p>
          <p>“You may still, if you choose, dispute and philosophize about
the inequality of races, and continue to insist on the boasted
superiority of <hi rend="italics">our</hi> Caucasian blood; but the greatest disadvantages which a
comparison can indicate will not prove that one's
claim to liberty is higher than another's. It may be that we
of the white race, are vastly superior to our African brethren.
The differences, however, are not flattering to us; for we should
remember with shame and confusion of face, that our injustice
and cruelty have produced them. Having first enslaved the
poor Africans and subsequently withheld from them every
means of improvement, it is not strange that such differences
should exist as those on which we plume ourselves. But is it
not intolerable that we should now quote them with such brazen
self-gratulation?<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Despite the manifold disadvantages that encumber and clog the
movements of the Africans, unfortunately for the validity of your
argument their race exhibits many proud specimens to prove their
capability of culture, and of the enjoyment of freedom. Give them but
the same opportunities that we have, and they will rival us in learning,
refinement, statesmanship, and general demeanor, as is incontestibly
shown in the lives and characters of many now living. Such men as Fred
Douglas and President Roberts, would honor any complexion; or, I
ought rather to say, should make us forget and despise the distinctions
of color, since they reach not below the surface of the skin, nor affect, in
the least, that better part that gives to man all his dignity and worth.
Nor need I point to these illustrious examples to rebut the inferences
you deduce from color. Every village and hamlet in your own sunny
South, can furnish an
<pb id="browne267" n="267"/>
abundant refutation, in its obscure but eloquent ‘colored preachers’—
noble patterns of industry and wisdom, who show forth, by their
exemplary bearing, all the beauty of holiness,—
‘allure to brighter worlds and lead the way.’ ”</p>
          <p>It is impossible to furnish even the faintest description of the
pleading earnestness of the speaker's tone. His full, round,
rich voice, grew intense, low and silvery in its harmonious utterance.
As he pronounced the last sentence, it was with difficulty
I could repress a cry of applause. Oh, surely, surely, I thought, our
cause, the African's cause, is not helpless, is not
lost, whilst it still possesses such an advocate. My eyes overflowed
with grateful tears, and I longed to kiss the hem of his
garment.</p>
          <p>“You forget,” answered Mr. Winston, “or you would do well
to consider, that these cases are exceptional cases, which neither
preclude my inferences nor warrant your assumption.”</p>
          <p>“Exceptions, indeed, they are; but why?” inquired Mr. Trueman.
“Exceptions, you know, prove the rule. Now, you
infer from the sooty complexion of the Africans, a natural and
necessary incapacity for the blessings of self-government and the
refinements of education. I have mentioned individuals of this fatal
complexion who are in the wise enjoyment of these
sublime privileges: one of them has acquired an enviable, celebrity as an
orator, the other is the accomplished President of the infant Liberian
Republic. If color incapacitated, as you seem to think, it would affect all
alike; but it has not incapacitated these, therefore it does not
incapacitate at all. These are exceptions not to the general <hi rend="italics">capacity</hi> of
the blacks, but only to their general opportunity. What they
have done others may do—the opportunities being equal.”</p>
          <p>“I have listened to you entire argument,” rejoined Mr.
Winston, “very patiently, with the expectation of hearing the
proposition sustained with which you so vauntingly set out. You will,
perhaps, accord to me the credit of being—what in this
age of ceaseless talk is rarely met—‘a good listener.’ But, after all my patience and attention, I am still unsatisfied—if not
<pb id="browne268" n="268"/>
shaken. You have failed to meet the argument drawn from the ‘curse’
pronounced on the progenitors of the unfortunate race: you have failed
to present or notice what is generally considered by theologians and
moralists the right of a purchaser—in your illustration from stolen
goods—to something for the money with which he parts; and here, I think, you
manifested great unfairness; and, above all, you have failed to propose
any feasible remedy for the state of things against which you inveigh.
What have you to say on these material points?”</p>
          <p>“Very much, my good sir, as you will find, if, instead of taking
advantage of every momentary pause to make out such a ‘failure’ as you
desire, you only prolong your very complimentary patience. I wish you
to watch the argument narrowly; to expose the faintest flaw you can
detect in it; and, at the end, if unsatisfied, cry out ‘failure,’ or let it wring from you a reluctant confession. You will, at least, before I shall have
done, withdraw the illiberal imputation of unfairness. It would be an
easy task for me to anticipate all you can say, and to refute it; but such
a course would leave you nothing to say, and, since I intend this
discussion to be strictly a conversation, I shall leave you at liberty to
present your own arguments in your own way. Now, as to the argument
from ‘the curse,’ you must permit me to observe, that your
interpretation is too free and latitudinarian. Mine is more literal, more in
accordance with the character of God; it fully satisfies the Divine
vengeance, and, whether correct or not, has, at least, as much authority
in its favor. Granting the dominion of the white over the black race to be
in virtue of ‘the curse,’ it by no means conveys such power as your
Southern institution seeks to justify. The word <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> nowhere occurs in
that memorable malediction; but there is an obvious distinction between
<hi rend="italics">its</hi> import and that of the word <hi rend="italics">servant</hi>, which it <hi rend="italics">does</hi> employ. Surely,
for the offence of looking upon the nakedness of his father, Ham could
not have incurred and entailed upon his posterity a heavier punishment
than they would necessarily suffer as the
<pb id="browne269" n="269"/>
simple servants of their brethren. And this consideration should induce
you to give them, at least, the same share of freedom as is enjoyed by the
<hi rend="italics">white servants</hi> to be found in many a household in the South. Such
servitude would be the utmost that a merciful God could require. Even
this, however, was under the old dispensation; and the reign of its laws,
customs, and punishments, should melt under the genial rays of the sun
of Christianity. Many of your own patriots, headed by Washington and
Jefferson, have long since, thought so; and but few in these days plead
‘the curse’ as excuse or justification for that ‘damned spot’ which all will
come ultimately to consider the disgrace of this enlightened age and
nation. As to your next point, the right which a purchaser of stolen
goods may acquire in them in consideration of the money which he
pays, I grant all the benefit that even the most generous theologian or
moralist can allow in the best circumstances of such a case. And what
does this amount to? A return of the purchase-money, with a reasonable
or very high rate of interest for the detention, would be as much as any
one could demand. Applying this to the case of the stolen Africans, how
many of those who were forced from their native land to this have died
on their master's hands without yielding by their labor, not alone the
principal, but a handsome percentage upon the money invested in their
purchase? Thus purchasers were indemnified—abundantly indemnified,
against loss. The indemnity, however, should have been sought from the
seller, not from the article or person sold. But, at best, purchasers of
stolen goods, to entitle themselves to any indemnity, should at least be
innocent; for if they buy such goods, <hi rend="italics">knowing them to be stolen</hi>, they are
guilty of a serious misdemeanor, which is everywhere punishable under
the law. ‘He who asks equity must do equity.’ When, therefore, you of
the South would realize the benefit of the concession of theologians and
moralists—the benefit of justice—you should bring yourselves within
the conditions they require; you should come into court with clean
hands, and with the intention of acting in good faith. Have you done so?
<pb id="browne270" n="270"/>
Did your fathers do so before you? Not at all. They were not ignorant
purchasers of the poor, ravished African; they knew full well that he had
been stolen and brought by violence from his distant home:
consequently, they were guilty of a misdemeanor in purchasing;
consequently, too, they come not within the case proposed by the
theologians and moralists, which might entitle them to indemnity; nor
were they in a condition to ask it. The present generation, claiming
through them, find themselves in the same predicament, with the same
title only, and the same unclean hands, perpetuating their foul
oppression. None of them, as I have shown, had a right to claim
indemnity by reason of having invested their money in that way; and, if
they ever had such right, they have been richly indemnified already.
Therefore, it is absurd for you to continue the slave business upon this
plea. Having thus answered your only objections to my position, I
might remind you of your determination, and call upon you to ‘liberate
your slaves,’ and take sides with me in opposition to the cruel
institution. You are greatly mistaken in supposing that my omission to
propose a plan, by which slave-holders could <hi rend="italics">conveniently, and without
pecuniary loss</hi>, emancipate their slaves, constitutes the slightest
objection to the argument I have advanced. If you defer their
emancipation until such a plan is proposed; if you are unwilling to incur
even a little sacrifice, what nobility will there be in the act, to entitle you
to the consideration of the just and good, or to the approval of your own
consciences? I sought by this discussion, to convince you that slavery
is an enormous evil; the proposition was declared in all its boldness.
You volunteered a pledge to release your slaves if I could sustain it, let
the sacrifice be what it might. Some sacrifice, then, you must have
anticipated; and, should your conviction now demand it, you have no
cause to complain of me. Your pledge was altogether voluntary; I did
not even ask it; nor did I design to suggest any such plan of universal
emancipation as would suit the <hi rend="italics">convenience</hi> of everybody. I am not so
extravagantly silly as to hope to do that. But, after all, why wait for a <hi rend="italics">plan</hi>?
<pb id="browne271" n="271"/>
Immediate, universal emancipation is not impracticable, and
numberless methods might and would at once be devised, if
the people of your States were sincere when they profess
to desire its accomplishment. Their <hi rend="italics">real</hi> wish, however, whatever it
may be, need not interfere between your individual pledge, and its
prompt fulfilment.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Trueman paused for full five minutes, and, as I peered out from
my hiding-place, I thought there was a very quizzical sort of expression
on his fine face.</p>
          <p>“Well, what have you to say?” he at length asked.</p>
          <p>“It seems to me,” Mr. Winston began, in an angry tone, “you speak
very flippantly and very wildly about general emancipation. Consider,
sir, that slavery is so woven into our society, that there is scarcely a
family that would not be more or less affected by a change.
Fundamental alterations in society, to be safely made, must be the slow
work of years:
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘Not the hasty product of a day,</l><l>But the well-ripened fruit of wise delay.’</l></lg></q>
So it is only by almost imperceptible degrees that the emancipationists
and impertinent Abolitionists can ever attain ‘the consummation’ they
pretend to have so much at heart. If they would just stay at home and
devote their spare time to cleansing their own garments, leaving us of the
South to suffer alone what they are pleased to esteem the evil and sin
and curse, the shame, burden and abomination of slavery, we should the
sooner discover its blasting enormities, and strive more zealously to
abolish them and the institution from which they proceed. Their
super-serviceable interference, hitherto, has only riveted and tightened the
bondage of those with whom they sympathize; and such a result will
always attend it. Our slaves, as at present situated, are very well
satisfied, as, indeed, they ought to be: for they are exempt from the
anxious cares of the free, as to what they shall eat or what they shall
drink, or wherewithal they shall be clothed. Many poor men of our own
color would gladly exchange conditions with them, because they find life to
<pb id="browne272" n="272"/>
be a hard, an incessant struggle for the scantiest comforts, with
which our slaves are supplied at no cost of personal solicitude.
Besides, sir, our institution of slavery is vastly more burdensome to
ourselves than to the negroes for whom you affect so in much
fraternal love.”</p>
          <p>“One would suppose, that if you thought it burdensome, you would
be making some effort to relieve yourselves,” interposed Mr. Trueman,
in that clear and pointed manner that was his peculiarity; “and, if
immediate emancipation were deemed impracticable in consequence
of the radical hold which this institution has at the South, you might
naturally be expected to be doing something toward that end by the
encouragement of education among those in bondage, by the sanction of
marriage ties between them, and by other efforts to ameliorate their
condition. Certain inducements might be presented for the manumission
of slaves by individual owners, for there are some of this class, I am
happy to think, who, in tender humanity, would release their slaves, if
the stringency of the laws did not deter them from it. Would it not be
well to abate somewhat of this rigor, and allow all slaves, voluntarily
manumitted, to remain in the several States with at least the privileges of
the free negroes now resident therein, so that the olden ties, which have
grown up between themselves and their owners, might not be abruptly
snapped asunder? Besides, to enforce the propriety of this alteration of
the law, it would be well to reflect that the South is the native home of
most of the slaves, who cherish their local attachments quite as much as
ourselves; and hence the law which now requires them, when by any
means they have obtained their freedom, to remove beyond the limits of
the State, is a very serious hardship and should cease to exist. This
would be a long stride toward your own relief from the burden of which
you complain. As to the slaves, who you think should be content with
their condition, in which they have, as you say, ‘no care for necessary
food and raiment,’ I would suggest that they have the faculty of
distinguishing between slavery and bondage, and have sense enough to
see that though these things,
<pb id="browne273" n="273"/>
which are generally of the coarsest kind, are provided by their masters,
the means by which they are furnished are but a scanty portion of their
own hard earnings. Were they free, they could work in the same way,
and be entitled to <hi rend="italics">all</hi> the fruits of their labor. Then they would have the
same inducements to toil that we now have, and the same ambition to
lift themselves higher and higher in the social scale. Those white men
whom you believe willing to exchange situations with them, are too
indolent to enjoy the privileges of freedom, and would be utterly
worthless as slaves. You declaim against the course which the
Abolitionists have pursued, and seem disposed, in consequence,
to tighten the cords of servitude. You would be let alone, forsooth,
to bear this burden as long as you please, and to get rid
of it at pleasure. So long as there was any hope that you
would do what you ought in the matter, you were let alone, and
if you were the only sufferers from your peculiar institution,
you might continue undisturbed; but the yoke lies heavy and
galling upon the poor slaves themselves, whose voices are stifled,
and it is high time for the friends of human rights to speak in
their behalf, till they make themselves heard. At this momentous
period, when new States and Territories are knocking for
admission at the doors of our Union—States and Territories of
free and virgin soil, which you are seeking to defile by the
introduction of slavery—it is fit that they should persevere in
their noble efforts, that they should resist your endeavors, and
strive with all their energies to confine the obnoxious institution
within its already too-extended bounds; for they know,
that, if they would attain their object—the ultimate and entire
abolition of slavery from our land—they should oppose
strenuously every movement tending to its extension; for, the broader
tile surface over which it spreads, the more formidable will be
the difficulty of its removal. Therefore it is that they are now
so zealously engaged, and they address you as men whose
‘judgment has not fled to brutish beasts,’ with arguments against the evil
itself and the weight of anguish it entails. Thus they have ever done, and
you tell me that the result has 
<pb id="browne274" n="274"/>
been to rivet the chains of those in whose behalf they plead. As well
might the sinner, whose guilt is pointed out to him by the minister of
God, resolve for that very reason to plunge more deeply into sin.”</p>
          <p>His voice became gradually calmer and calmer, until finally it sank
into the low notes of a solemn half-whisper. I held my breath in intense
excitement, but this transport was broken by the harsh tones of the
Virginian, who said</p>
          <p>“All this is very ridiculous as well as unjust; for, at the South slaves
are regarded as property, and, inasmuch as our territories are acquired
by the common blood and treasure of the whole country, we have as
much right to locate in them with our property as you have with any of
those things which are recognized as property at the North. In your
great love of human rights you might take some thought of us; but the
secret of your action is jealousy of our advancement by the aid of
slave-labor, which you would have at the North if you needed it. We
understand you well, and we are heartily tired of your insulting and
impudent cant about the evils of the system of slavery. We want no
more of it.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Trueman, without noticing the insolence of Winston, continued
in the same impressive manner:</p>
          <p>“We do take much thought of you at the South, and hence it is that
we dislike to see you passively submitting to the continuance of an
institution so fraught with evil in itself, and very burdensome, as even
you have admitted. We, of the North, feel strongly bound to you by the
recollection of common dangers, struggles and trials; and, with an
honorable pride, we wish our whole nation to stand fair, and, so far as
possible, blameless before the world. We are doing all we can to remove
the evils of every kind which exist at the North; and, as we are not
sectional in our purposes, we would stimulate you to necessary action
in regard to your especial system. We know its evils from sore
experience, for it once prevailed amongst us; but, fortunately, we
opened our eyes, and gave ourselves a blessed riddance of it. The
example is well worthy of your
<pb id="browne275" n="275"/>
imitation, but, ‘pleased as you are with the possession<corr>’</corr>, says Blackstone,
speaking of the origin and growth of property, ‘you seem afraid to look
back to the means by which it was acquired, as if fearful of some defect
in your title; or, at best, you rest satisfied with the decision of the laws
in your favor, without examining the reason or authority upon which
those laws have been built.’ To the eyes of the nations, who regard us
from far across the ocean, and who see us, as a body, better than we see
ourselves, slavery is the great blot that obscures the disc of our
Republic, dimming the effulgence of its Southern half, as a partial eclipse
darkens the world's glorious luminary. It is, therefore, not alone upon the
score of human rights in general, but from a personal interest in our
National character, that the Abolitionists interfere. Various
Congressional enactments have confirmed the justice of these views,
which they are endeavoring to enforce by moral suasion (for they
deprecate violence) upon the South. Those enactments assume
jurisdiction, to some extent at least, upon the subject of slavery, having
gone so far as to prohibit the continuance of the slave-trade, denouncing
it as piracy, and punishing with death those who are in any way engaged
in it. I have yet to learn that the South has ever protested against this
law, in which the Abolitionists see a strong confirmation of their own
just principles. Why should they not go a step further, and forbid all
traffic in slaves, such as is pursued among your people? Why do not the
States themselves interpose their power to put down at once and
forever, such nefarious business? This would be productive of vastly
more good than anything which Colonization societies can effect.”</p>
          <p>“Suppose, sir.” began Mr. Winston, “we were to annul the present
laws regulating the manumission of slaves, and to abolish the institution.
entirely from our midst; where would be the safety of our own white
race? There is great cause for the apprehension generally entertained, of
perpetual danger and annoyance, if they were permitted to remain
among us. They are there in large numbers, and, having once obtained
their
<pb id="browne276" n="276"/>
freedom, with permission to reside where they now are, they would
seek to become ‘a power in the State,’ which would incite them, if
resisted, into fearful rebellion. These are contingencies which sagacious
statesmen have foreseen<corr sic="."/> and which they would be unable to avert.
Consequently, they had rather bear those ills they have, than fly to
others that they know not of.”</p>
          <p>“How infelicitous,” Mr. Trueman suddenly retorted, “is your
quotation, for, truly, you ‘know not’ that these anticipated
consequences would ensue; but ‘motes they are to trouble
the mind's eye.’ Your sagacious statesmen might more wisely
employ their thoughts in contemplating the more probable
results of continuing your slaves in their present abject condition.
Far more reason is there to apprehend rebellion and insurrection
now, than the distant dangers you predict. Even this last objection is 
vain, unsubstantial, and, at best, only speculative,
resorted to as an unction to mollify the sores of conscience.
Some of your eminent men have expressed a hope that the
colored race might be removed from the South, and from
slavery, through the instrumentality of Colonization, by which,
it is expected, that they would eventually be transported to
Africa, and encouraged to establish governments for themselves.
This proposal is liable, and with more emphasis, to the
objection I advanced a while ago, when speaking of the laws
which practically discourage manumission, for, if it is a hardship
(as I contend it is) for them to be driven from their native
State to one strange and unfamiliar to them, it is increasing
that severity to require them to seek a home in Africa, whose
climate is as uncongenial to them as to us, and with whose
institutions they feel as little interest, or identity, as we do.
Admit, for a moment, the practicability of such a scheme. We
should, soon after, be called upon to recognize them as one of
the nations of the earth, with whom we should treat as we do
now with the English, French, German, and other nations. I
will suggest to your Southern sages, who delight in speculations,
that, in the progress of years, they might desire, in imitation
<pb id="browne277" n="277"/>
of some other people, to accept the invitations we extend to
the oppressed and unhappy of the earth. What is there, in that case, to
binder them from immigrating in large numbers? Could you distinguish
between immigrants of their class, and those who now settle upon our
soil? Either you could or you could not. If you could not so
distinguish, you would in all likelihood have them speedily back,
in greater numbers than they come from Green Erin, or Fader-land.
Thus you would be reduced to almost the same condition as general
emancipation would bring about; but, if you could, and did make the
distinction, is it not quite likely that deadly offence would be
given to their government, which, added to their already accumulated
wrongs, would light up the fires of a more frightful
war than the intestine rebellion you have talked of; or than
any that has ever desolated this continent? Bethink yourselves
of these things amid your gloomy forebodings, and you will find
them pregnant with fearful issues. You will discover, too, the
folly of longer maintaining your burdensome system, and the
wisdom of heeding whilst you may, the counsel of the philanthropic,
which urges you to just, generous, speedy, universal
emancipation. But I have fatigued you, and will stop; hoping
soon to hear that you have magnanimously redeemed the
promise which I had the gratification to bear at the commencement of our 
conversation.”</p>
          <p>When Mr. Trueman paused, Mr. Winston sprang to his feet in a rage,
knocking over his chair in the excitement, and declaring that he had most
patiently listened to flimsy Abolition talk, in which there was no
shadow of argument, mere common cant; that he would advise Mr.
Trueman to be more particular in the dissemination of his dangerous and
obnoxious opinions and, as to his own voluntary pledge, it was conditional,
and those conditions had not been complied with, and he did not consider himself
bound to redeem it. Mr. Trueman endeavored to calm and soothe the
hot-blooded Southerner; but his words had no effect upon the illiberal
man, whom he had so fairly demolished in argument.</p>
          <pb id="browne278" n="278"/>
          <p>As they passed my hiding-place, <hi rend="italics">en route</hi> to their respective
apartments, I peeped out through a crevice in the door at them. It was
very easy to detect the calm, self-poised man, the thoughtful reasoner,
in the still, pale face and erect form of Trueman; whilst the red,
hot-flushed countenance, the quick, peering eye and audacious manner of the
other, revealed his unpleasant disposition and unsystematized mind.</p>
          <p>When the last echo of their retreating footsteps had died upon the
ear, I stole from my concealment, and ventured to my own quarters.
Many new thoughts sprang into existence in my mind, suggested by the
conversation to which I had listened.</p>
          <p>I venerated Mr. Trueman more than ever. No disciple ever regarded
the face of his master so reverently as I watched his countenance, when I
chanced to meet him in any part of the house.</p>

            <p>THE MISDEMEANOR—THE PUNISHMENT—ITS CONSEQUENCE—
FRIGHT.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE next day Miss Jane, observing my unusual thoughtfulness,
said:</p>
          <p>“Come, now, Ann, you are not quite free. From the airs that you
have put on, one would think you had been made so.”</p>
          <p>“What have I done, Miss Jane?” This was asked in a quiet tone,
perhaps not so obsequiously as she thought it should be. Thereupon
she took great offence.</p>
          <p>“How dare you, Miss, speak <hi rend="italics">—</hi> in that tone? Take that,” and she
dealt me a blow across the forehead with a long, limber whalebone, that
laid the flesh open. I was so stunned by it that I reeled, and should have
fallen to the floor, had I not supported myself by the bed-post.</p>
          <p>“Don't you dare to scream.”</p>
          <p>I attempted to bind up my brow with a handkerchief. This she
regarded as affectation.</p>
          <p>“Take care, Miss Ann,” she often prefixed the Miss when she was
mad, by way of taunting me; “give yourself none of those important
airs, I'll take you down a little.”</p>
          <p>When Mr. Summerville entered, she began to cry, saying:</p>
          <p>“Husband, this nigger-wench has given me a great deal of
impertinence. Father never allowed it; now I want to know if you will
not protect me from such insults.”</p>
          <p>“Certainly, my love, I'll not allow any one, white or black, to insult
you. Ann, how dare you give your mistress impudence?”</p>
          <p>“I did not mean it, Master William.” I had thus addressed him ever
since his marriage.</p>
          <p>I attempted to relate the conversation that had occurred,
<pb id="browne280" n="280"/>
wherein Miss Jane thought I had been impudent, when she suddenly
sprang up, exclaiming:</p>
          <p>“Do you allow a negro to give, testimony against your own wife?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly not.”</p>
          <p>“Now, Mr. Summerville,” she was getting angry with him, “I require
you to whip that girl severely; if you don't do it—why—” and she
ground her teeth fiercely.</p>
          <p>“I will have her whipped, my dear, but I cannot whip her.”</p>
          <p>“Why can't you?” and the lady's eye flashed.</p>
          <p>“Because I should be injured by it. <hi rend="italics">Gentlemen</hi> do not correct negroes: 
they hire others to do that sort of business.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, well, then, hire some one who will do it well.”</p>
          <p>“Come with me, Ann,” he said to me, as I stood speechless with fear
and mortification.</p>
          <p>“Seeing him again motion me to follow, I, forgetful of the injustice
that had been done me, and the honest resentment I should feel—forgetful
of everything but the humiliation to which they were going to subject
me—fell on my knees before Miss Jane, and besought her to excuse, to
forgive me, and I would never offend her again.</p>
          <p>“Don't dare to ask mercy of me. You know that I am too much like
father to spare a nigger.”</p>
          <p>Ah, well I knew it! and vainly I sued to her. I might have known that
she rejoiced too much in the sport; and, had she been in the country,
would have asked no higher pleasure than to attend to it personally. A
negro's scream of agony was music to her ears.</p>
          <p>I governed myself as well as I could while I followed Mr.
Summerville, through the halls and winding galleries. Down flights of
steps, through passages and lobbys we went, until at last we landed in
the cellar. There Mr. Summerville surrendered me to the care of a Mr.
Monkton, the bar-keeper of the establishment duly appointed and
fitted for the office of slave-whipping.</p>
          <p>“Here,” said Mr. Summerville, “give this girl a good,
<pb id="browne281" n="281"/>
genteel whipping; but no cruelty, Monkton, and here is your fee;” so
saying he handed him a half-dollar, then left the dismal cellar.</p>
          <p>I have since read long and learned accounts of the gloomy,
subterranean cells, in which the cruel ministers of the Spanish
Inquisition performed their horrible deeds; and I think this
cellar very nearly resembled them. There it was, with its low,
damp, vault-like roof; its unwholesome air, earthen floor,
covered with broken wine bottles, and oyster cans, the debris of
many a wild night's revel! There stood the monster Monkton,
with his fierce, lynx eye, his profuse black beard, and frousy
brows; a great, stalwart man, of a hard face and manner, forming no bad 
picture of those wolfish inquisitors of cruel, Catholic
Spain!</p>
          <p>Over this untempting scene a dim, waning lamp, threw its blue glare,
only rendering the place more hideous.</p>
          <p>“Now, girl, I am to lick you well. You see the half-dollar. Well, I'm to
git the worth of it out of your hide. Now, what would you think if I
didn't give you a single lick?”</p>
          <p>I looked him full in the face, and even by that equivocal light I had
power to discern his horrid purpose, and I quickly and proudly replied,</p>
          <p>“I should think you did your duty poorly.”</p>
          <p>“And why?”</p>
          <p>“Because you engaged to do <hi rend="italics">the job</hi>, and even received your pay in
advance; therefore, if you fail to comply with your bargain, you are not
trustworthy.”</p>
          <p>“Wal, you're smart enough for a lawyer.”</p>
          <p>“Well, attend to your business.”</p>
          <p>“This is my business,” and he held up a stout wagon-whip; “come,
strip off.”</p>
          <p>“That is not a part of the contract.”</p>
          <p>“Yes; but it's the way I always whips 'em.”</p>
          <p>“You were not told to use me so, and I am not going to remove one
article of my clothing.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but you <hi rend="italics">shall</hi>;” and he approached me, his wild eye
<pb id="browne282" n="282"/>
glaring with a lascivious light, and the deep passion-spot blazing
on his cheek.</p>
          <p>“Girl, you've got to yield to me. I'll have you now, if its only to
show you that I can.”</p>
          <p>I drew back a few steps, and, seizing a broken bottle, waited, with a
deadly purpose, to see what he would do. He came so near that I
almost fancied his fetid breath played with its damnable heat upon my
very cheek.</p>
          <p>“You've got to be mine. I'll give you a fine calico dress, and a pretty
pair of ear-bobs!”</p>
          <p>This was too much for further endurance. What! must I give up the
angel-sealed honor of my life in traffic for trinkets? Where is the
woman that would not have hotly resented such an insult?</p>
          <p>I turned upon him like a hungry lioness, and just as his wanton hand
was about to be laid upon me, I dexterously aimed, and hurled the bottle
directly against his left temple. With a low cry of pain he fell to the
floor, and the blood oozed freely from the wound.</p>
          <p>As my first impression was that I had slain him, so was it my first
desperate impulse to kill myself; yet with a second thought came my
better intention, and, unlocking the door, I turned and left the gloomy
cell. I mounted the dust-covered steps, and rapidly threaded silent,
spider -festooned halls, until I regained the upper courts. How beautiful
seemed the full gush of day-light to me! But the heavy weight of a
supposed crime bowed me to the earth.</p>
          <p>My first idea was to proceed directly to Mr. Summerville's
apartment and make a truthful statement of the affair. What he would
do or have done to me was a matter upon which I had expended no
thought. My apprehension was altogether for the safety of my soul.
Homicide was so fearful a thing, that even when committed in actual
self-defence, I feared for the justice of it. The Divine interrogatory made to
Cain rang with painful accuracy in my mental ear! “Am I my brother's
keeper?” I repeated it again and again, and I lived years in the brief
<pb id="browne283" n="283"/>
space of a moment. Away over the trackless void of the future fled
imagination, painting all things and scenes with a sombre color.</p>
          <p>The first recognizable person whom I met was Mr. Winston. I knew
there was but little to hope for from him, for ever since the argument
between himself and Mr. Trueman, he had appeared unusually
haughty; and the waiters said that he had become excessively
overbearing, that he was constantly knocking them around with his
gold-headed cane, and swearing that Kentucky slaves were almost as bad as
Northern free negroes.</p>
          <p>Henry (who had become a <hi rend="italics">most dear friend of mine</hi>) told me
that Mr. Winston had on one or two occasions, without the
slightest provocation, struck him severely over the head; but
these things were pretty generally done in the presence of Mr.
Trueman, and for no higher object, I honestly believe, than to
annoy that pure-souled philanthropist. So I was assured that
he was not one to entrust with my secret, especially as a great
intimacy had sprung up between him and Miss Jane. I, therefore,
hastily passed him, and a few steps on met Mr. Trueman.
How serene appeared his chaste, marble face! Who that looked
upon him, with his quiet, reflective eye, but knew that an angel
sat enthroned within his bosom? Do not such faces help to
prove the perfectibility of the race? If, as the transcendentalists believe,
these noble characters are only types of what the
<hi rend="italics">whole man</hi> will be, may we not expect much from the advent
of that dubious personage?</p>
          <p>“Mr. Trueman,” I said, and my voice was clear and unfaltering, for
something in his face and manner exorcised all fear,
“I have done a fearful deed.”</p>
          <p>“What, child?” he asked, and his eye was full of solicitude.</p>
          <p>I then gave him a hurried account of what had occurred in the cellar. After a slight pause, he said:</p>
          <p>“The best thing for you to do will be to make instant confession to
Mr. Summerville. Alas! I fear it will go hard with you, for <hi rend="italics">you are a
slave</hi>.”</p>
          <p>I thanked him for the interest he had manifested in me, and
<pb id="browne284" n="284"/>
passed on to Miss Jane's room. I paused one moment at the floor,
before turning the knob. What a variety of feelings were at work in my
breast! Had I a fellow-creature's blood upon my hands? I trembled in
every limb, but at length controlled myself sufficiently to enter.</p>
          <p>There sat Miss Jane, engaged at her crochet-work, and Master
William playing with the balls of cotton and silk in her little basket.</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann, I trust you've got your just deserts, a good whipping,”
said Miss Jane, as she fixed her eyes upon me.</p>
          <p>Very calmly I related all that had occurred. Mr. Summerville sprang
to his feet and rushed from the room, whilst Miss Jane set up a series
of screams loud enough to reach the most distant part of the house. All
my services were required to keep her from swooning, or <hi rend="italics">affecting to
swoon</hi>.</p>
          <p>The ladies from the adjoining room <sic corr="rushed">srushed</sic> in to her assistance, and
were soon busy chafing her bands, rubbing her feet, and bathing her
temples.</p>
          <p>“Isn't this terrible!” ejaculated one.</p>
          <p>“What <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the matter?” cried another.</p>
          <p>“Poor creature, she is hysterical,” was the explanation of a third.</p>
          <p>I endeavored to explain the cause of Miss Jane's excitement.</p>
          <p>“You did right,” said one lady, whose truly womanly spirit burst
through all conventionality and restraint.</p>
          <p>“What,” said one, a genuine Southern conservative, “do you
say it was right for a slave to oppose and resist the punishment
which her master had directed?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly not; but it was right for a female, no matter whether
white or black, to resist, even to the shedding of blood, the lascivious
advances of a bold libertine.”</p>
          <p>“Do you believe the girl's story?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; why not?”</p>
          <p>“I don't; it bears the impress of falsehood on its very face.”</p>
          <p>“No,” added another Kentucky true-blue, “Mr. Monkton
<pb id="browne285" n="285"/>
was going to whip her, and she resisted him. That's the
correct version of the story, I'll bet my life on it.”</p>
          <p>To all of this aspersion upon myself, I was bound to be a silent
auditor, yet ever obeying their slightest order to hand them water,
cologne, &amp;c. Is not this slavery indeed?</p>
          <p>When Mr. Summerville left the room, he hastily repaired to the bar,
where he made the story known, and getting assistance, forthwith went
to the cellar, Mr. Winston forming one of the party of investigation.
His Southern prejudices were instantly aroused, and he was ready “to
do or die” for the propogation of the “peculiar institution.”</p>
          <p>The result of their trip was to find Monkton very feeble from the
loss of blood, and suffering from the cut made by the broken bottle, but
with enough life left in him for the fabrication of a falsehood, which was
of course believed, as he had a <hi rend="italics">white face</hi>. He stated that he had
proceeded to the administration of the whipping, directed by my master;
that I resisted him; and finding it necessary to bind me, he was
attempting to do so, when I swore that I would kill him, and that suiting
the action to the word, I hurled the broken bottle at his temples.</p>
          <p>When Mr. Summerville repeated this to Miss Jane, in my presence,
stating that it was the testimony that Monkton was prepared to give in
open court, for I was to be arrested, I could not refrain from uttering a
cry of surprise, and saying:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Monkton has misrepresented the case, as ‘I can show.’ ”</p>
          <p>“Yes, but you will not be allowed to give evidence,” said Master
William.</p>
          <p>“Will Mr. Monkton's testimony be taken?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>“Certainly, but a negro cannot bear witness against a white person.”</p>
          <p>I said nothing, but many thoughts were troubling me.</p>
          <p>“You see, Ann, what your bad conduct has brought <hi rend="italics">you</hi> to,” said
Miss Jane.</p>
          <p>Again I attempted to tell the facts of the case, and defend myself, but
she interrupted me, saying:</p>
          <p>“Do you suppose I believe a word of that? I can assure
<pb id="browne286" n="286"/>
you I do not, and, moreover, I'm not going to spend my money to have
a lawyer employed to keep you from the punishment you so richly
deserve. So you must content yourself to take the public hanging or
whipping in the jail yard, which is the penalty that will be affixed to
your crime.” Turning to Mr. Summerville, she added, “I think it will do
Ann good, for it will take down her pride, and make her a valuable
nigger. She has been too proud of her character; for my part, I had rather
she had had less virtue. I've always thought she was virtuous because
she did not want us to increase in property, and was too proud to have
her children live in bondage.”</p>
          <p>I dared not make any remark; but there I stood in dread of the
approaching arrest, which came full soon.</p>
          <p>As I was sewing for Miss Jane, Mr. Summerville opened the door,
and said to a rough man, pointing to me</p>
          <p>“There's the girl.”</p>
          <p>“Come along with me to jail, gal.”</p>
          <p>How fearfully sounded the command. The jail-house was a place of
terror, and though I had in my brief life “supped full of horrors,” this
was a new species of torture that I had hoped to leave untasted.</p>
          <p>Taking with me nothing but my bonnet, I followed Constable
Calcraft down stairs into the street. Upon one of the
landings I met Henry, and I knew from his kindly mournful
glance, that he gave me all his compassion.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Ann,” he said, extending his hand to me, “good-bye, and
keep of good cheer; the Lord will be with you.” I looked at him, and
saw that his lip was quivering; and his dark eye glittered with a furtive
tear. I dared not trust my voice, so, with a grateful pressure of the
hand, I passed him by, keeping up my composure right stoutly. At the
foot of the stair I met Louise, who was weeping.</p>
          <p>“I believe you, Ann, we all believe you, and the Lord will make it
appear on the day of your trial that you are right, only keep up your
spirits, and read this,” and she slipped a little pocket-Testament into
my hand, which was a welcome present.</p>
          <pb id="browne287" n="287"/>
          <p>Now, I thought, the last trial is over. All the tender ones who love
me have spoken their comforting words, and I may resume my pride
and hauteur; but no—standing within the vestibule was the man whom
I reverenced above all others, Mr. Trueman. One effort more, and then I
might be calm; but before the sunshine of his kindliness the snow and
ice of my pride melted and passed away in showers of tears. The first
glance of his pitying countenance made me weep. I was weary and
heavy-laden, and, even as to a mortal brother, I longed to pour into his
ear the pent-up agony of my soul.</p>
          <p>“Poor girl,” he said kindly, as he offered me his white and
finely-formed hand, “I believe you innocent; there is that in your clear,
womanly look, your unaffected utterance, that proves to me you are
worthy to be heard. Trust in God.”</p>
          <p>Oh, can I ever forget the diamond-like glister of his blue eyes! and
<hi rend="italics">that tear</hi> was evoked from its fountain for my sorrow; even then I felt a
thrill of joy. We love to have the sympathy and confidence of the truly
great. I made no reply, in words, to Mr. Trueman, but he understood
me.</p>
          <p>Conducted by the constable, I passed through a number of streets, all
crowded with the busy and active, perhaps the <hi rend="italics">happy</hi>. Ah, what a fable
that word seemed to express! I used to doubt every smiling face I saw,
and think it a <hi rend="italics">radiant lie</hi>! but, since then, though in a subdued sense, I
have learned that mortals may be happy.</p>
          <p>We stopped, after a long walk, in front of a large building of Ionic
architecture, and of dark brown stone, ornamented by beautiful flutings,
with a tasteful slope of rich sward in front, adorned with a variety of
flowers and shrubbery. Through this we passed and reached the first
court, which was surrounded by a high stonewall. Passing through a
low door-way, we stood on the first pave; here I was surrendered to the
keeping of the jailer, a man apparently devoid of generosity and
humanity. After hearing from Constable Calcraft an account of the
crime for which I was committed, he observed—</p>
          <p>“A sassy, impudent, <hi rend="italics">on</hi>ruly gal, I guess; we have plenty
<pb id="browne288" n="288"/>
<hi rend="italics">sich</hi>; this will larn her a lessin. Come with me,” he said, as he turned
his besotted face toward me.</p>
          <p>Through dirty, dark, filthy passages I went, until we reached a
gloomy, loathsome apartment, in which he rudely thrust me, saying—</p>
          <p>“Thar's your quarters.”</p>
          <p>Such a place as it was! A small room of six by eight, with a dirty,
discolored floor, over which rats and mice scampered <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ad libitum</hi></foreign>. One
miserable little iron grate let in a stray ray of daylight, only revealing
those loathsome things which the friendly darkness would have
concealed. Cowering in the corner of this wretched pen was a poor,
neglected white woman, whose face seemed unacquainted with soap
and water, and her hair tagged, ragged, and unused to comb or brush.
She clasped to her breast a weasly suckling, that every now and then
gave a sickly cry, indicative of the cholic or a heated atmosphere.</p>
          <p>“Poor comfort!” said the woman, as I entered, “poor comfort here,
whare the starved wretches are cryin' for ar. My baby has bin a sinkin'
ever sense I come here. I'd not keer much if we could both die.”</p>
          <p>“For what are you to be tried?”</p>
          <p>“For takin' a loaf of bread to keep myself and child from starvin'.”</p>
          <p>She then asked me for what I stood accused. I told her my story, and
we grew quite talkative and sociable, thereby realizing the old axiom,
“Misery loves company.”</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>For several days I lingered on thus, diversifying the time only by
reading my Testament, the gift of Louise, and occasionally having a
long talk with my companion, whom I learned to address by the name
of Fanny. She was a woman of remarkably sensitive feelings, quick and
warm in all her impulses; just such a creature as an education and
kindly training would have made lovely and lovable; but she had been
utterly neglected—had grown up a complete human weed.</p>
          <pb id="browne289" n="289"/>
          <p>Our meals were served round to us upon a large wooden drawer, as
filthy as dirt and grease could make it. The cuisine dashed our rations, a
slice of fat bacon and “pone” of corn bread to us, with as little
ceremony as though we had been dogs; and we were allowed one
blanket to sleep on.</p>
          <p>One day, when I felt more than usually gloomy, I was agreeably
disappointed, as the cumbersome door opened to admit my kind friend
Louise. The jailer remarked:</p>
          <p>“You may stay about a quarter of an hour, but no longer.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, sir,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“This is very kind of you, Louise,” for I was touched by the visit.</p>
          <p>“I wanted to see you, Ann; and look what I brought you!” She held
a beautiful bouquet to me.</p>
          <p>“Thank you, thank you a thousand times, this <hi rend="italics">is</hi> too kind,” I said, as
I watered the lovely flowers with my tears.</p>
          <p>“Oh, they were sent to you,” she answered, with a smile.</p>
          <p>“And who sent them?”</p>
          <p>“Why, Henry, of course;” and again she smiled.</p>
          <p>I know not why, but I felt the blood rushing warmly to my face, as I
bent my head very low, to conceal a confusion which I did not
understand.</p>
          <p>“But here is something that I did bring you,” and, opening a basket,
she drew out a nice, tempting pie, some very delicious fruit cake, and
white bread.</p>
          <p>“I suppose your fare is miserable?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, worse than miserable.”</p>
          <p>Fanny drew near me, and without the least timidity, stretched forth
her hand.</p>
          <p>“Oh, please give me some, only a little; I'm nearly starved?”</p>
          <p>I freely gave, her the larger portion, for she could enjoy it. I had the
flowers, the blessed flowers, that Henry had sent, and they were food
and drink for me!</p>
          <p>Louise informed me that, since my arrest, she had cleared up and
arranged Miss Jane's room; and she thought it was Mr. Summerville's
intention to sell me after the trial.</p>
          <pb id="browne290" n="290"/>
          <p>“Have you heard who will buy me?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, no, I don't suppose an offer has yet been made; nor do I know
that it is their positive intention to sell you; but that is what I judged
from their conversation.”</p>
          <p>“If they get me a good master I am very willing to be sold; for I
could not find a worse home than I have now.”</p>
          <p>“I expect if he sells you, it will be to a trader; but, keep up your
heart and spirits. Remember,  ‘sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.’
But I hear the sound of footsteps; the jailer is coming; my quarter of an
hour is out.”</p>
          <p>“How came he to admit you?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I know Mr. Trayton very well. I've washed for his wife, and
she owes me a little bill of a couple of dollars; so when I came here, I
said by way of a bait,  ‘Now, Mrs. Trayton, I didn't come to dun you,
I'll make you a present of that little bill;<corr sic="&quot;">’</corr> then she and he were both in a
mighty good humor with me. I then said, “I've got a friend here, and I'd
take it as a favor if you'd let me see her for a little while.<corr sic="'">”</corr></p>
          <p>Mr. Trayton said:</p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh, that can't be—it's against the rules.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“So his wife set to work, and persuaded him that he owed me a
favor, and he consented to let me see you for a quarter of an hour only.
Before he comes, tell me what message I am to give Henry for you. I
know he will be anxious to hear.”</p>
          <p>Again I felt the blood tingling in my veins, and overspreading my
face. I began to play with my flowers, and muttered out something
about gratitude for the welcome present, a message which, incoherent as
it was, her woman's wit knew to be sincere and gracious. After a few
moments the jailer came, saying:</p>
          <p>“Louise, your time is up.”</p>
          <p>I am ready to go, and she took up her basket. After bidding me a
kind <foreign lang="fre">adieu</foreign> she departed, carrying with her much of the sunshine which
her presence had brought, but not all of it, for she left with me a ray or
so to illumine the darkened cell of recollection. There on my lap lay the
blooming flowers,
<pb id="browne291" n="291"/>
<hi rend="italics">his</hi> gift! Flowers are always a joy to us—they gladden and
beautify our outer and every-day life; they preach us a sermon of beauty
and love; but to the weary, lonely captive, in his dismal cell, they are
particularly beautiful! They speak to him in a voice which nothing else
can, of the glory of the sun-lit world, from which he is exiled. Thanks to
God for flowers! Rude, and coarse, and vile must be the nature that
can trample them with unhallowed feet!</p>
          <p>There I sat toying with them, inhaling their mystic odor, and
luxuriating upon the delicacy of their ephemeral beauty. All flowers
were dear to me; but these were particularly precious, and wherefore?
Is there a single female heart that will not divine “the wherefore”?
You, who are clad in satin, and decked with jewels, albeit your face is as
white as snow, cannot boast of emotions different from ours? Feeling,
emotion, is the same in the African and the white woman? We are made
of the same clay, and informed by the same spirit.</p>
          <p>The better portion of the night I sat there, sadly wakeful, still
clutching those flowers to my breast, and covering them with kisses.</p>
          <p>The heavy breathing of my companion sounded drowsily in my ear,
yet never wooed me to a like repose. Thus wore on the best part of the
night, until the small, shadowy hours, when I sank to a sweet dream. I
was wandering in a rich garden of tropical flowers, with Henry by my
side! Through enchanted gates we passed, hand in hand, singing as we
went. Long and dreamily we loitered by low-gurgling summer fountains,
listening to the lulling wail of falling water. Then we journeyed on
toward a fairy flower-palace, that loomed up greenly in the distance,
which ever, as we approached it, seemed to recede further.</p>
          <p>I awoke before we reached the floral palace, and I am womanly
enough to confess, that I felt annoyed that the dream had been broken
by the cry of Fanny's babe. I puzzled myself trying to read its import.
Are there many women who would have differed from me? Yet I was
distressed to find
<pb id="browne292" n="292"/>
Fanny's little boy-babe very sick, so much so as to require medical
attention; but, alas! she was too poor to offer remuneration to a doctor,
therefore none was sent for; and, as the child was attacked with croup,
it actually died for the want of medical attention. And this occurred in a
community boasting of its enlightenment and Christianity, and in a city
where fifty-two churches reared their gilded domes and ornamented
spires, in a God-fearing and God-serving community, proud of its benevolent societies, its hospitals, &amp;c. In what, I ask, are these Christians better than the
Pharisees of old, who prayed long, well, and much, in their splendid temples?</p>

          <p>THE day of my trial dawned as fair and bright as any that ever broke
over the sinful world. It rose upon my slumber mildly, and without
breaking its serenity. I slept better on the night preceding the trial, than
I had done since my incarceration.</p>
          <p>I knew that I was friendless and alone, and on the eve of a trial
wherein I stood accused of a fearful crime; that I was defenceless; yet I
rested my cause with Him, who has bidden the weary and heavy-laden
to come unto Him, and He will give them rest. Strong in this
consciousness, I sank to the sweetest slumber and the rosiest dreams.
Through my mind gracefully flitted the phantom of Henry.</p>
          <p>When Fanny woke me to receive my unrelished breakfast,
she said:</p>
          <p>“You've forgot that this is the day of trial; you sleep as unconsarned
as though the trial was three weeks off. For my part, now that the
baby is dead, I don't kere much what becomes of me.”</p>
          <p>“My cause,” I replied, “is with God. To His keeping I have confided myself; therefore, I can sleep soundly.”</p>
          <p>“Have you got any lawyer?”</p>
          <p>“No; I am a slave, and my master will not employ one.”</p>
          <p>After a few hours we heard the sound of a bell, that announced the
opening of court. The jailer conducted me out of the jail yard into the
Court House. It was the first time I had ever seen the interior of a
court-room, when the court was in full session, and I was not very much
edified by the sight.</p>
          <pb id="browne294" n="294"/>
          <p>The outside of the building was very tasteful and elegant, with most
ornate decorations; but the interior was shocking. In the first place it
was unfinished, and the bald, unplastered walls struck me as being
exceedingly comfortless. Then the long, redundant cobwebs were
gathered in festoons from rafter to rafter, whilst the floor was fairly
tesselated with spots of tobacco-juice, which had been most
dexterously ejected from certain <hi rend="italics">legal</hi> orifices, commonly known as the
<hi rend="italics">mouths of lawyers</hi>, who, for want of opportunity to <hi rend="italics">speak</hi>, resorted to
chewing.</p>
          <p>The judge, a lazy-looking old gentleman, sat in a time-worn arm-chair,
ready to give his decision in the case of the Commonwealth <hi rend="italics">versus</hi> Ann,
slave of William Summerville; and seeming to me very much as though
his opinion was made up without a hearing.</p>
          <p>And there, ranged round his Honor, were the practitioners and
members of the bar, all of them in seedy clothes, unshorn, and
unshaven. Here and there you would find a veteran of the bar, who
claimed it as his especial privilege to outrage the King's or the
President's English and common decency; and, as a matter of course, all
the younger ones were aiming to imitate him; but, as it was impossible
to do that in ability, they succeeded, to admiration, in copying his ill-manners.</p>
          <p>Two of them I particularly noticed, as I sat in the prisoner's dock,
awaiting the “coming up of my case.” One of them the Court frequently addressed as Mr. Spear, and a very pointless spear he seemed;—a little, short, chunky man, with yellow, stiff, bristling hair, that stood out very straight, as if to declare its independence of the brain, and
away it went on its owner's well-defined principle of “going it on your
own hook.” He had a little snub of a nose that possessed the good taste
to turn away in disgust from its neighbor, a tobacco-stained mouth of no
particular dimensions, and, I should judge from the sneer of the said
nose, of no very pleasant odor; little, hard, flinty, grizzly-gray eyes,
that seemed to wink as though they were afraid of seeing the truth.
Altogether, it was the most disagreeably-comic phiz that I remember
ever to have seen. To complete
<pb id="browne295" n="295"/>
the ludicrous picture, he was a self-sufficient body, quite elate at the
idea of speaking, “in public on the stage.” His speech was made up of the frequent repetition of “my client claims” so and so, and “may it please your Honor,” and “I'll call the attention of the Court to the fact,” and such like phrases, but whether his client was guilty of the charge set forth in the indictment, he neither proved nor disproved.</p>
          <p>The other individual whom I remarked, was a great, fat, flabby man,
whose flesh (like that of a rhinoceros) hung loosely on the bones. He
seemed to consider personal ease, rather than taste, in the arrangement
of his toilet; for he appeared in the presence of the court in a pair of half-worn
slippers, stockings “down-gyved,” a shirt-bosom much spotted
with tobacco-juice, and a neck-cloth loosely adjusted about his red,
beefish throat. His little watery blue eye reminded me forcibly of
skimmed milk; whilst his big nose, as red as a peony, told the story that
he was no advocate of the Maine liquor law, and that he had “<hi rend="italics">voted for
license.</hi>”</p>
          <p>He was said, by some of the bystanders, to have made an excellent
speech adverse to his client, and in favor of the side against which he
was employed.</p>
          <p>“Hurrah for litigation,” said an animadverter who stood in proximity
to me. After awhile, and in due course of docket, my case came up.</p>
          <p>“Has she no counsel?” asked the judge.</p>
          <p>After a moment's pause, some one answered, “No; she has none.”</p>
          <p>I felt a chill gathering at my heart, for there was a slight movement in
the crowd; and, upon looking round, I discovered Mr. Trueman making
his way through the audience. After a few words with several members
of the bar and the judge, he was duly sworn in, and introduced to the
Court as Mr. Trueman, a lawyer from Massachusetts, who desired to
be admitted as a practitioner at this bar. Thus duly qualified, he
volunteered his services in my defence. The look which I gave him came
directly from my overflowing heart, and I am sure spoke my
<pb id="browne296" n="296"/>
thanks more effectual than words could have done. But he gave me no
other recognition than a faint smile.</p>
          <p>As the case began, my attention was arrested. The jury was selected
without difficulty; for, as none of the panel had heard of the case, the
counsel waived the privilege of challenging. After the reading of the
indictment, setting forth formally “an assault upon Mr. Monkton, with
intent to kill, by one Ann, slave of William Summerville,” the Commonwealth's attorney introduced Mr. Monkton himself as the only witness in the case</p>
          <p>In a very minute and evidently pre-arranged story, he proceeded to
detail the circumstances of a violent and deadly assault, which seemed
to impress the jury greatly to my prejudice. When he had concluded, the
prosecutor remarked that he had no further evidence, and proposed to
submit the case, without argument, to the jury, as Mr. Trueman had no
witnesses in my favor. To this proposal, however, Mr. Trueman would
not accede; and so the prosecutor briefly argued upon the testimony and
the law applicable to it. Then Mr. Trueman rose, and a thrill seemed to
run through the audience as his tall, commanding form stood proud and
erect, his mild saint-like eyes glowing with a fire that I had never seen
before. He began by endeavoring to disabuse the minds of the jury of the
very natural ill-feeling they might entertain against a slave, supposed to
have made an attack upon the life of a white man; reviewed at length the
distinctions which are believed, at the South, to exist between the two
races; and dwelt especially upon those oppressive enactments which
virtually place the life of a slave at the mercy of even the basest of the
white complexion. Passing from these general observations, he examined,
with scrutiny the prepared story of Mr. Monkton, showing it to be a
vile fabrication of defeated malice, flatly contradictory in essential
particulars, and utterly unworthy of reliance under the wise maxim of the
law, that “being false in one thing, it was false in all.” In conclusion, he
made a stirring appeal to the jury, exhorting them to rescue this feeble
woman from the foul machinations which had been invented for her ruin;
to rebuke, by
<pb id="browne297" n="297"/>
their righteous verdict, this swift and perjured witness; and to
vindicate before the world the honor of their dear old Commonwealth,
which was no less threatened by this ignominious proceeding than the
safety of his poor and innocent client.</p>
          <p>The officers of the Court could scarcely repress the applause which
succeeded this appeal.</p>
          <p>“Finally, gentlemen,” resumed Mr. Trueman, “permit me to
take back to my Northern home the warm, personal testimony
to your love of justice, which, unbiased by considerations of
color, is dealt out to high and low, rich and poor, white and
black, with equal and impartial hands. Disarm, by your verdict
in this instance, the reproach by which Kentucky may
hereafter be assailed when her enemies shall taunt her with injustice
and cruelty. It has long been said, at the North, that
 ‘the South cannot show justice to a slave.’ Now, gentlemen,
'tis for you, in the character of sworn jurors, to disprove, by
your verdict, this oft-repeated, and, alas! in too many instances,
well-authenticated charge. And I conjure you as men, as
Christians, as jurors, to deal justly, kindly, humanely with this
poor uncared-for slave-woman. As you are men and fathers,
slave-holders even, show her justice, and, if need be, mercy, as
in like circumstances you would have these dispensed to your
own daughters or slaves. She is a woman, it may be an uncultured one;
this place, this Court, is strange to her. There she
sits alone, and seemingly friendless, in the dock. Where was
her master? Had he prepared or engaged an advocate? No,
sir; he left her helpless and undefended; but that God, alike
the God of the Jew and the Gentile, has, in the hour of her
need, raised up for her a friend and advocate. And be ye, Gentlemen
of the Jury, also the friend of the neglected female!
By all the artlessness of her sex, she appeals to you to rescue
her name from this undeserved aspersion, and her body from the
tortures of the lash or the halter. Mark, with your strongest
reprobation, that lying accuser of the powerless, who, thwarted
in the attempt to violate one article in the Decalogue, has here,
and in your presence, accomplished the outrage of another,
<pb id="browne298" n="298"/>
invoking upon his soul, with unholy lips, the maledictions with which God
will sooner or later overwhelm the perjurer. Look at
him now as he cowers beneath my words. His blanched cheek and
shrivelling eye denote the detected villain. He dares not, like an honest,
truth-telling man, face the charges arrayed against him. No, conscious
guilt and wicked passion are bowing him now to the earth. Dare he look
me full in the eye? No; for he fears lest I, with a lawyer's skill, should
draw out and expose the malicious fiend that has urged him on to the
persecution of the innocent and defenceless. Send him from your midst
with the brand of severest condemnation, as an example of the fate
which awaits a false witness in the Courts of the Commonwealth of
Kentucky. Restore to this prisoner the peace of mind which has been
destroyed by this prosecution. Thus you will provide for yourselves a
source of consolation through all the future, and I shall thank heaven
with my latest breath for the chance that threw me, a stranger, in your
city to-day, and led me to this temple of justice to urge your minds to
the right conclusion.</p>
          <p>He sat down amid such thunders of applause as incurred the censure
of the judge. When order was restored, the Commonwealth's attorney
rose to close the case. He said “he could see no reason for doubting the
veracity of his witness whom the opposition had so strenuously
endeavored to impeach. For his own part, he had long known Mr.
Monkton, and had always regarded him as a man of truth. The present
was the first attempt at his impeachment that he had ever heard of, and
he felt perfectly satisfied that Mr. Monkton would survive it. Had he
been the character which his adversary had described, it might have been
possible to find some witness who could invalidate his testimony. No
one, however, has appeared; and I take it that no one exists. The
gentleman would do well to observe a little more caution before he
attacks so recklessly the reputation of a man.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Trueman rising, requested the prosecutor to indulge him for one
moment.</p>
          <pb id="browne299" n="299"/>
          <p>“Certainly,” was the reply.</p>
          <p>“I desire the jury and the Court to remember,” said Mr. Truman, “that I made no attack upon the <hi rend="italics">reputation</hi> of the witness in this case.
Doubtless <hi rend="italics">that</hi> is all which it is claimed to be. I freely concede it; but the
earnest prosecutor must permit me to distinguish between <hi rend="italics">reputation</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">character</hi>. I did assail the character of the man, but not hypothetically
or by shrewd conjectures; ‘out of his own mouth I condemned
him.’ This is not the first instance of crime committed by a
man, who, up to the period of transgression, stood fair before the world.
The gentleman's own library will supply abundant proof of the success
of strong temptation in its encounters with even <hi rend="italics">established virtue</hi>; and I
care not if this willing witness could bolster up his reputation with the
voluntary affidavits of hosts of friends; his own testimony, to-day,
would have still produced and riveted the conviction of his really base
character. I thank the gentleman for his indulgence.”</p>
          <p>The prosecutor continuing, endeavored to show that the testimony
was, upon its face, entirely credible, and ought to have its weight with
the jury. He labored hard to reconcile its many and material
contradictions, reiterated his own opinion of the witness as a man of
truth; and, with an inflammatory warning against the <hi rend="italics">Abolition counsel</hi>,
who, he said, was perhaps now “meditating in our midst some sinister
design against the peculiar institution of the South,” he ended his fiery
harangue.</p>
          <p>When he had taken his seat, Mr. Trueman addressed the Court as
follows:</p>
          <p>“Before the jury retire, may it please your Honor, as the case is of a
serious nature, and as we have no witness for the defence, I would ask
permission merely to repeat the version of the circumstances of this
case detailed to me by the prisoner at the bar. Such a statement, I am
aware, is not legal evidence; but if, in your clemency, you would permit
it to go to the jury simply for what it is worth, the course of justice I
am sure would by no means be impeded.”</p>
          <p>The judge readily consented to this request, and Mr.
<pb id="browne300" n="300"/>
Trueman rehearsed my story, as narrated in the foregoing pages.</p>
          <p>The Commonwealth's attorney then rejoined with a few remarks.</p>
          <p>After a retirement of a few minutes, the jury returned with a verdict
of “guilty as charged in the indictment,” ordering me to receive two
hundred lashes on my bare back, not exceeding fifty at a time. I was
then remanded to jail to await the execution of my sentence.</p>
          <p>Very gloomy looked that little room to me when I returned
to it, with a horrid crime of which, Heaven knows, I was guiltless, 
affixed to my name, and the prospect of a cruel punishment
awaiting me. Who may tell the silent, unexpressed agony
that I there endured? Certain I am. that the nightly stars and
the old pale moon looked not down on a more wretched
heart. There I sat, looking ever and again at the stolid Fanny,
who had been sentenced to the work-house for a limited time.
Since the death of her infant she had lost all her loquacity, and remained
in a kind of dreamy, drowsy state, between waking and sleeping.</p>
          <p>Through how many scenes of vanished days, worked the plough-share
of memory, upturning the fresh earth, where lay the buried seeds
of some few joys! And, sometimes, a sly, nestling thought of Henry
hid itself away in the most covert folds of my heart. His melancholy
bronze face had cut itself like a fine cameo, on my soul. The old,
withered flowers, which he had sent, lay carefully concealed in a corner
of the cell. Their beauty had departed like a dim dream; but a little of
their fragrance still remained despite decay.</p>
          <p>One day, after the trial, I was much honored and delighted by a visit
from no less a personage than Mr. Trueman himself.</p>
          <p>I was overcome, and had not power to speak the thanks with which
my grateful heart ran over. He kindly pitied my embarrassment, and
relieved me by saying,</p>
          <p>“Oh, I know you are thankful to me. I only wish, my good girl, that
my speech had rescued you from the punishment you have to suffer.
Believe me, I deeply pity you; and, if money
<pb id="browne301" n="301"/>
could avert the penalty which I know you have not merited, I would
relieve you from its infliction; but nothing more can be done for you.
You must bear your trouble bravely.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, my kind, noble friend!” I passionately exclaimed, “words like these would arm me with strength to brave a punishment ten times
more severe than the one that awaits me. Sympathy from you can
repay me for any suffering. That a noble white gentleman, of
distinguished talents, should stoop from his lofty position to espouse
the cause of a poor mulatto, is to me as pleasing as it is strange.”</p>
          <p>“Alas, my good girl, you and all of your wronged and injured race are
objects of interest and affection to me. I would that I could give you
something more available than sympathy: but these Southerners are a
knotty people; their prejudices of caste and color grow out, unsightly
and disgusting, like the rude excrescences upon a noble tree, eating it
away, and sucking up its vital sap. These Western people are of a
noble nature, were it not for their sectional blemishes. I never relied
upon the many statements which I have heard at the North, taking them
as natural exaggerations; but my sojourn here has proved them to be
true.”</p>
          <p>I then told him of the discussion that I had overheard between him
and Mr. Winston.</p>
          <p>“Did you hear that?” he asked with a smile. “Winston has been
very cool toward me ever since; yet he is a man with some fine points
of character, and considerable mental cultivation. This one Southern
feeling, or rather prejudice, however, has well-nigh corrupted him. He
is too fiery and irritable to argue; but all Southerners are so. They
cannot allow themselves to discuss these matters. Witness, for instance,
the conduct of their Congressional debaters. Do they reason? Whenever
a matter is reduced to argumentation, the Southerner flies off at a
tangent, resents everything as personal, descends to abuse, and thus
closes the debate.”</p>
          <p>I ventured to ask him some questions in relation to Fred Douglas; to
all of which he returned satisfactory answers. He informed me that
Douglas had once been a slave; that he
<pb id="browne302" n="302"/>
was now a man of social position; of very decided talent and energy. “I
know of no man,” continued Mr. Trueman, “who is more deserving of
public trust than Douglas. He conducts himself with extreme modesty
and propriety, and a quiet dignity that inclines the most fastidious in
his favor.”</p>
          <p>He then cited the case of Miss Greenfield (<hi rend="italics">the</hi> black swan), showing
that my race was susceptible of cultivation and refinement in a high
degree.</p>
          <p>Thus inspired, I poured forth my full soul to him. I told him how, in
secret, I had studied; how diligently I had searched after knowledge;
how I longed for the opportunity to improve my poor talents. I spoke
freely, and with a degree of nervous enthusiasm that seemed to affect
him.</p>
          <p>“Ann,” he said, and large tears stood in his eyes, 
“it is a shame for you to be kept in bondage. A proud, 
aspiring soul like yours, if once free to follow its impulses, might achieve much. 
Can you not labor to
buy yourself? At odd times do extra work, and, by your savings, you
may, in the course of years, be enabled to buy yourself.”</p>
          <p>“My dear sir, I've no ‘odd times’ for extra work, or I would gladly
avail myself of them. Lazy I am not; but my mistress requires all my
time and labor. If she were to discover that I was working, even at night
for myself, she would punish me severely.”</p>
          <p>I said this in a mournful tone; for I felt that despair was my portion.
He was silent for awhile; then said,</p>
          <p>“Well, you must do the best you can. I would that I could advise
you; but now I must leave. A longer stay would excite suspicion. You
heard what they said the other day about Abolitionists.”</p>
          <p>I remembered it well, and was distressed to think that he had been
abused on my account.</p>
          <p>With many kind words he took his leave, and I felt as if the sunshine
had suddenly been extinguished.</p>
          <p>During his entire visit poor Fanny had slept. She lay like one in an
opium trance. For hours after his departure she remained so,
and much time was left me for reflection.</p>
        </div2>

          <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>EXECUTION OF THE SENTENCE—A CHANGE—HOPE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ON the last and concluding day of the term of the court, the jailer
signified to me that the constable would, on the morrow, administer the
first fifty lashes; and, of course, I passed the night in great trepidation.</p>
          <p>But the morning came bright and clear, and the jailer, accompanied
by Constable Calcraft, entered.</p>
          <p>“Come, girl,<corr>”</corr> said the latter, “ I have to execute the sentence upon
you.”</p>
          <p>Without one word, I followed him into the jail yard.</p>
          <p>“Strip yourself to the waist,” said the constable.</p>
          <p>I dared not hesitate, though feminine delicacy was rudely shocked.
With a prayer to heaven for fortitude, I obeyed.</p>
          <p>Then, with a strong cowhide, he inflicted fifty lashes (the first
instalment of the sentence) upon my bare back; each lacerating it
to the bone. I was afterwards compelled to put my clothes on over my
raw, bloody back, without being allowed to wash away the clotted gore;
for, upon asking for water to cleanse myself, I was harshly refused, and
quickly re-conducted to the cell, where, wounded, mortified, and
anguish-stricken, I was left to myself.</p>
          <p>Oh, God of the world-forgotten Africa! Thou dost see these, things;
Thou dost hear the cries which daily and nightly we are sending up to
Thee! On that lonely, wretched night Thou wert with me, and my
prison became as a radiant mansion, for angels cheered me there! Glory
to God for the cross which He sent me; for it led me on to Him.</p>
          <pb id="browne304" n="304"/>
          <p>Poor Fanny, after her sentence was pronounced, was soon sent to
the work-house; so I was alone. The little Testament which Louise had
given me, was all the company that I desired. Its rich and varied words
were as manna to my hungry soul; and its blessed promises rescued me
from a dreadful bankruptcy of faith.</p>
          <p>Subsequently, and at three different times, I was led forth to receive
the remainder of my punishment.</p>
          <p>After the last portion was given, I was allowed to go to the kitchen
of the jail and wash myself and dress in some clean clothes,
which Miss Jane had sent me. I was then conducted by the
constable to the hotel.</p>
          <p>Miss Jane met me very distantly, saying—</p>
          <p>“I trust you are somewhat humbled, Ann, and will in future be a
better nigger.”</p>
          <p>I was in but a poor mood to take rebukes and reproaches; for my
flesh was perfectly raw, the intervals between the whippings having
been so short as not to allow the gashes even to close; so that upon
this, the final day, my back presented one mass of filth and clotted
gore. I was then, as may be supposed, in a very irritable humor, but a
slave is not allowed to have feeling. It is a privilege denied him,
because his skin is black.</p>
          <p>I did not go out of Miss Jane's room, except on matters of business,
about which she sent me. I would, then go slipping around, afraid of
meeting Henry. I did not wish him to see me in that mutilated
condition. I saw Louise in Miss Jane's room; but there she merely
nodded to me. Subsequently we met in a retired part of the hall, and
there she expressed that generous and friendly sympathy which I knew
she so warmly cherished for me.</p>
          <p>Somehow or other she had contrived to insinuate herself wondrously
into Miss Jane's good graces; and all her influence she endeavored to
use in my favor.</p>
          <p>In this private interview she told me that she would induce
<pb id="browne305" n="305"/>
Miss Jane to let me sleep in her room; and she thought she knew what
key to take her on.</p>
          <p>“If,” added she, “I get you to my apartment, I will care for you
well. I will wash and dress your wounds, and render you every
attention in my power.”</p>
          <p>I watched, with admiration, her tactics in managing Miss Jane. That
evening when I was seated in an obscure corner of the room, Miss Jane
was lolling in a large arm-chair, playing with a bouquet that had been
sent her by a gentleman. This bouquet had been delivered to her, as I
afterwards learned, by Louise. Miss Jane had grown to be fashionable
indeed; and had two favorite beaux, with whom she interchanged notes,
and Louise had been selected as a messenger.</p>
          <p>On this occasion, the wily mulatto came up to her, rather familiarly,
I thought, and said—</p>
          <p>“Ah, you are amusing yourself with the Captain's flowers
I must tell him of it. Dear sakes! but it will please him;” she then
whispered something to her, at which both of them laughed heartily.</p>
          <p>After this Miss Jane was in a very decided good humor, and Louise
fussed about the apartment pretty much as she pleased. At length,
throwing open the window, she cried out—</p>
          <p>“How close the air is here! Why, Mrs. St. Lucian, the fashionable,
dashing lady who occupied this room just before you, Mrs. <sic corr="Summerville">Somerville</sic>,
wouldn't allow three persons to be in it at a time; and her servant-girl
always slept in my room. By the way, that just reminds me how
impolite I've been to you; do excuse me, and I will be glad to relieve
you by letting Ann go to my room of nights.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, it will trouble you, Louise.”</p>
          <p>“Don't talk or think of  troubling me; but come along girl,” she said,
turning to me.</p>
          <p>“Go with Louise, Ann,” added Miss Jane, as she perceived me
hesitate, “ but come early in the morning to get me ready for breakfast.”</p>
          <p>Happy even for so small a favor as this, I followed Louise
<pb id="browne306" n="306"/>
to her room. There I found everything very comfortable and, neat. A
nice, downy bed, with its snowy covering; a bright-colored carpet, a
little bureau, washstand, clock, rocking-chair, and one or two pictures,
with a few crocks of flowers, completed the tasteful furniture of this
apartment.</p>
          <p>All this, I <sic corr="inwardly">inly</sic> said, is the arrangement and taste of a mulatto
in the full enjoyment of her freedom! Do not her thrift and industry
disprove the oft-repeated charge of indolence that is made
upon the negro race?</p>
          <p>She seemed to read my thoughts, and remarked, “You are
surprised, Ann, to see my room so nice! I read the wonder in your
face. I have marked it before, in the countenances of slaves. They
are taught, from their infancy up, to regard themselves as unfit for 
the blessings of free, civilized life; and I am happy to give the lie, by 
my own manner of living, to this rude charge.</p>
          <p>“How long have you been free, Louise, and how did you obtain your
freedom?”</p>
          <p>“It is a long story,” she answered; “you must be inclined to sleep; you need rest. At some other time I'll tell you. Here, take this arm-chair,
it is soft; and your back is wounded and sore; I am going to dress
it for you.”</p>
          <p>So saying, she left the room, but quickly returned with a basin of
warm water and a little canteen of grease. She very kindly bade me
remove my dress, then gently, with a soft linten-rag, washed my back,
greased it, and made me put on one of her linen chemises and a nice
gown, and giving me a stimulant, bade me rest myself for the night
upon her bed, which was clean, white, and tempting.</p>
          <p>When she thought I was soundly sleeping, she removed from a little,
swinging book-shelf a well-worn Bible. After reading a chapter or so,
she sank upon her knees in prayer! There may be those who would
laugh and scoff at the piety of this woman, because of her tawny,
complexion; but the Great Judge, to whose ear alone her
supplication was made, disregards all such
<pb id="browne307" n="307"/>
distinctions. Her soul was as precious to Him, as though her
complexion had been of the most spotless snow.</p>
          <p>On the following morning, whilst I was arranging Miss Jane's
toilette, she said to me, in rather a kind tone:</p>
          <p>“Ann, Mr. Summerville wants to sell you, and purchase a smaller
and cheaper girl for me. Now, if you behave yourself well, I'll allow
you to choose your own home.”</p>
          <p>This was more kindness than I expected to receive from her, and I
thanked her heartily.</p>
          <p>All that day my heart was dreaming of a new home—perhaps a kind,
good one! On the gallery I met Mr. Trueman (I love to write his name).
Rushing eagerly up to him, I offered my hand, all oblivious of the wide
chasm that the difference of race had placed between us; but, if that
thought had occurred to me, his benignant smile would have put it to
flight. Ah, he was the true reformer, who illustrated, in his own
deportment, the much talked-of theory of human brotherhood! He, with
all his learning, his native talent, his social position and legal
prominence, could condescend to speak in a familiar spirit to the
lowliest slave, and this made me, soured to harshness, feel at case in his
presence.</p>
          <p>I told him that I was fast recovering from the effects of my
whipping. I spoke of Louise's kindness, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>“I am to be sold, Mr. Trueman; I wish that you would buy me.”</p>
          <p>“My good girl, if I had the means I would not hesitate to make the
purchase, and instantly draw up your free papers; but I am, at the
present, laboring under great pecuniary embarrassments, which deny me
the right of exercising that generosity which my heart prompts in this
case.”</p>
          <p>I thanked him, over and over again, for his kindness. I felt not a little
distressed when he told me that he should leave for Boston early on the
following day. In bidding me adieu, he slipped, very modestly, into my
hand a ten-dollar bill, but this I could not accept from one to whom I
was already heavily indebted.</p>
          <pb id="browne308" n="308"/>
          <p>“No, my good friend, I cannot trespass so much upon on. Already I
am largely your debtor. Take back this money,” I offered him the bill,
but his face colored deeply, as he replied:</p>
          <p>“No, Ann, you would not wound my feelings, I am sure.”</p>
          <p>“Not for my freedom,” I earnestly answered.</p>
          <p>“Then accept this trifling gift. Let it be among the first of your
savings, as my contribution, toward the purchase-money for your
freedom.” Seeing that I hesitated, he said, “if you persist in refusing,
you will offend me.”</p>
          <p>“Anything but that,” I eagerly cried, as I took the money from that
blessed, charity-dispensing hand.</p>
          <p>And this was the last I saw of him for many years; and, when we
again met, the shadow of deeper sorrows was resting on my brow.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>Several weeks had elapsed since Miss Jane's announcement that I
was to be sold, and I had heard no more of it. I dared not renew the
subject to her, no matter from what motive, for she would have
construed it as impudence. But my time was now passing in
comparative pleasure, for Miss Jane was wholly engrossed by fun,
frolic, and dissipation. Her mornings were spent in making or receiving
fashionable calls, and her afternoons were devoted to sleep, whilst the
night-time was given up entirely to theatres, parties, concerts, and such
amusements. Consequently my situation, as servant, became pretty
much that of a sinecure. Oh, what delightful hours I passed in Louise's
room, reading! I devoured everything in the shape of a book that fell
into my hands. I began to improve astonishingly in my studies. It
seemed that knowledge came to me by magic. I was surprised at the
rapidity of my own advancement. In the afternoons, Henry had a good
deal of leisure, and he used to steal round to Louise's room, and sit
with us upon a little balcony that fronted it, and looked out upon a
beautiful view. There lay the placid Ohio, and just beyond it ran the
blessed Indiana shore! “Why was I not born on that side of the river?”
I used to say to Henry, as I pointed across the water.</p>
          <pb id="browne309" n="309"/>
          <p>“Or why,” he would answer, as his dark eye grew intensely black,
were our ancestors ever stolen from Africa?”</p>
          <p>“These are questions,” said the more philosophical Louise,
“that we must not propose. They destroy the little happiness we
already enjoy.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, you can afford to talk thus, Louise, for you are free; but we,
poor slaves, know slavery from actual experience and endurance,” said
Henry.</p>
          <p>“I have had my experience too,” she answered, “and a dark one has it been.”</p>
          <p>The evening on which this conversation occurred, was unusually fair
and calm. I shall ever remember it. There we three sat, with mournful
memories working in our breasts; there each looking at the other,
murmuring secretly, “Mine is the heaviest trouble!”</p>
          <p>“Louise,” I said, “tell us how you broke the chains of bondage.”</p>
          <p>“I was,” said she, after a moment's pause, “a slave to a family of wealth, residing a few miles from New Orleans. I am, as you see, but
one-third African. My mother was a bright mulatto. My father a white
gentleman, the brother of my mistress. Louis De Calmo was his name.
My mother was a housemaid, and only fifteen years of age at my birth.
She was of a meek, quiet disposition, and bore with patience all her
mistress' reproaches and harshness; but, when alone with my father, she
urged him to buy me, and he promised her he would; still he put her off
from time to time<corr>.</corr> She often said to him that for herself she did not care;
but, for me, she was all anxiety. She could not bear the idea of her child
remaining in slavery. All her bright hopes for me were suddenly brought
to a close by my father's unexpected death. He was killed by the
explosion of a steamboat on the lower Mississippi, and his horribly-mangled
body brought home to be buried. My mother loved him; and, in
her grief for his death, she had a double cause for sorrow. By it her
child was debarred the privilege of freedom. I was but nine years of age
at the time, but I well
<pb id="browne310" n="310"/>
remember her wild lamentation. Often she would catch me to her heart,
and cry out,  ‘if you could only die I should be so happy;’ but I did not.
I lived on and grew rapidly. We had a very kind overseer, and his son
took a great fancy to me. He taught me to read and write. I was
remarkably quick. When I was but fifteen, I recollect mistress fancied,
from my likely appearance and my delicate, gliding movements, that
she would make a dining-room servant of me. I was taken into the
house, and thus deprived of the instructions which the overseer's son
had so faithfully rendered me. I have often read half of the night. Now I
approach a melancholy part of my story. Master becoming embarrassed
in his business, he must part with some of his property. Of course the
slaves went. My mother was numbered among the lot. I longed and
begged to be sold with her; but to this mistress would not consent—
considered me too valuable as a house-girl. Well, mother and I parted.
None can ever know my wretchedness, unless they have suffered a
similar grief, when I saw her borne weeping and screaming away from
me. I have never heard from her since. Where she went or into whose
hands she fell, I never knew. She was sold to the highest bidder, under
the auctioneer's hammer, in the New Orleans market. I lived on as best I
could, bearing an aching heart, whipped for every little offence, serving,
as a bond-woman, her who was, by nature and blood, <hi rend="italics">my Aunt</hi>. After a
year or so I was sold to James Canfield, a bachelor gentleman in New
Orleans, and I lived with him, as a wife, for a number of years. I had
several beautiful children, though none lived to be more than a few months
old. At the death of this man I was set free by his will, and three
hundred dollars were bequeathed me by him. I had saved a good deal of
money during his life-time, and this, with his legacy, made me
independent. I remained in the South but a short time. For two years
after his death I sojourned in the North, sometimes hiring myself out as
chambermaid, and at others living quietly on my means; but I must
work. In activity I stifle memory, and for awhile am happy, or, at least,
tranquil.”</p>
          <pb id="browne311" n="311"/>
          <p>After this synopsis of her history, Louise was silent. She bent her
head upon her hand, and mused abstractedly.</p>
          <p>“I think, Henry, you are a slave,” I said, as I turned my eye upon his
mournful face.</p>
          <p>“Yes, and to a hard master,” was the quick reply; “but he
has promised me I shall buy myself. I am to pay him one
thousand dollars, in instalments of one hundred dollars each.
Three of these instalments I have already paid.”</p>
          <p>“Does he receive any hire for your services at this hotel?”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, the proprietor pays him one hundred and fifty dollars a
year for me.”</p>
          <p>“How have you made the money?”</p>
          <p>“By working at night and on holidays, going on errands, and doing
little jobs for gentlemen boarding in the house. Sometimes I get little
donations from kind-hearted persons, Christmas gifts in money, &amp;c. All
of it is saved.”</p>
          <p>“You must work very hard.”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, it's very little sleep I ever get. How old would you think
me?”</p>
          <p>“Thirty-five,” I answered, as I looked at his furrowed face.</p>
          <p>“That is what almost every one says; yet I am only twenty-five. All
these wrinkles and hard spots are from work.”</p>
          <p>“You ought to rest awhile,” I ventured to suggest.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I'll wait until I am my own master; then I'll rest.”</p>
          <p>“But you may die before that time comes.”</p>
          <p>“So I may, so I may,” he repeated despondingly. “All my family
have died early and from over-work. Sometimes I think freedom too
great a blessing for me ever to realize.”</p>
          <p>He brushed a tear from his eye with the back of his hand. I looked at
him, so young and energetic, yet lonely. Noble and handsome was his
face, despite the lines of care and labor. What wonder that a soft feeling
took possession of my heart, particularly when I remembered how he
had gladdened my imprisonment with kind messages and the gift of
flowers. I did but follow an irrepressible and spontaneous impulse,
when I said with earnestness.</p>
          <pb id="browne312" n="312"/>
          <p>“Do not work so hard, Henry.”</p>
          <p>He looked me full in the face. Why did my eye droop beneath that
warm, inquiring gaze; and why did he ask so low, in a half whisper:</p>
          <p>“Should I die who will grieve for me?”</p>
          <p>And did not my uplifted glance tell him who would? We understood
each other. Our hearts had spoken, and what followed may easily be
guessed. Evening after evening we met upon that balcony to pledge our
souls in earnest vows. Henry's eye grew brighter; he worked the harder;
but his pile of money did not increase as it had done. Many a little
present to me, many a rare nosegay, that was purchased at a price he
was not able to afford, put off to a greater distance his day of freedom.
Like a green, luxuriant spot in the wide desert of a lonely life, seems to
me the memory of those hours? On Sunday evenings, when his labor
was over, which was generally about eight o'clock, we walked through
the city, and on moonlight nights we strayed upon the banks of the
Ohio, and planned for the future.</p>
          <p>Henry was to buy himself, then go North, and labor in some hotel, or
at whatever business he could make the most money; he would return
to buy me. This was one of our plans; but as often as we talked, we
made a new one.</p>
          <p>“Oh, we shall be so happy, Ann,” he would exclaim.</p>
          <p>Then I would repeat the often-asked question, “Where shall we live?”</p>
          <p>Sometimes we decided upon New York city; then a village in the State
of New York; but I think Henry's preference was a Canadian town. Idle
speculators that we were, we seldom adhered long to our preference for
any one spot!</p>
          <p>“At least, dear,” he used to say, in his encouraging way, “we will hunt a home; and, no matter where we find it, we can make it a happy one if we
are together.”</p>
          <p>And to this my heart gave a warm echo. I was beginning to be happy;
for imagination painted joys in the future, and the present was not all
mournful, for Henry was with me!
<pb id="browne313" n="313"/>
The same roof covered us. Twenty times a-day I met him in the
dining-room, hall, or in the lobby, and he was always with me in the
evening.</p>
          <p>Slaves as we were, I've often thought as we wandered beneath the
golden light of the stars, that, for the time being, we were as happy as
mortals could be. Young first-love knit the air in a charmed silver mist
around us; and, hand in hand, we trod the wave-washed shore, always
with our eyes turned toward the North, the bourne whither all our
thoughts inclined.</p>
          <p>“Does not the north star point us to our future home?” Henry
frequently asked. I love to recall this one sunny epoch in my life. For
months, not an unpleasant thing occurred.</p>
          <p>Immediately after my trial, Monkton left the city, and went, as I
understood, south. Miss Jane was busied with fashion and gayety. Mr.
Summerville was engaged at his business, and every one whom I saw
was kind to me. So I may record the fact that for a while I was happy!</p>

            <p>SOLD—LIFE AS A SLAVE—PEN—CHARLES' STORY—
UNCLE PETER'S TROUBLE—A STAR PEEPING FORTH FROM
THE CLOUD.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>WHILST the hours thus rosily slided away, and I dreamed amid the
verdure of existence, the syren charmed me wisely, indeed, with her
beautiful promises. Poor, simple-hearted, trusting slaves! We could not
see upon what a rocking bridge our feet were resting, how slippery and
unsubstantial was the flowery declivity whereon we stood. There we
reposed in the gentle light of a happy trance; we saw not the clouds,
dark and tempest-charged, that were rising rapidly to bide the stars
from our view.</p>
          <p>One Sunday afternoon, Henry having finished his work much earlier
than usual, and done some little act whereby the good will of his
temporary master (the keeper of the hotel) was propitiated, and Miss
Jane and Mr. Summerville having gone out, I willingly consented to his
proposal to take a walk. We accordingly wandered off to a beautiful
wood, just without the city limits, a very popular resort with the
negroes and poorer classes, though it was the only pretty green
woodland near the city. Yet, because the “common people and negroes”
(a Kentucky phrase) went there, it was voted vulgar, and avoided by
the rich and refined. One blessing was thus given to the poor!</p>
          <p>Henry and I sought a retired part of the grove, and, seating ourselves
on an old, moss-grown log, we talked with as much hope, and indulged
in as rosy dreams, as happier and lordlier lovers. For three bright hours
we remained idly rambling through the flower-realm of imagination;
but, as the long shadows began to fall among the leaves, we prepared to
return home.</p>
          <pb id="browne315" n="315"/>
          <p>That night when I assisted Miss Jane in getting ready for bed, I
observed that she was unusually gloomy and petulant. I could do
nothing to please her; she boxed my ears repeatedly; stuck pins in me,
called me “detestable nigger,” &amp;c. Even the presence of Louise failed to restrain her, and I knew that something awful had happened.</p>
          <p>For two or three days this cloud that hung about her deepened and
darkened, until she absolutely became unendurable. I often found her
eyes red and swollen, as though she had spent the entire night in
weeping.</p>
          <p>Mr. Summerville was gloomy and morose, never saying much, and
always speaking harshly to his wife.</p>
          <p>At length the explosion came. One morning he said to me,
“gather up your clothes, Ann, and come with me; I have sold
you.”</p>
          <p>Though I was stricken as by a thunderbolt, I dared not express my
surprise, or even ask who had bought me. All that I ventured to say
was,</p>
          <p>“Master William, I have a trunk.”</p>
          <p>“Well, shoulder it yourself. I'm not going to pay for having it taken.”</p>
          <p>Though my heart was wrung I said nothing, and, lifting up my
trunk, beneath the weight of which I nearly sank, I followed Master
William out of the house.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Miss Jane,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, and be a good girl,” she replied, kindly, and my heart
almost softened toward her; for in that moment I felt as if deserted by
every faculty.</p>
          <p>“Come on, Ann, come on,” urged Master William; and I
mechanically obeyed.</p>
          <p>In the cross-hall I met Louise, who exclaimed, “Why, Ann, where are
you going?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know, Louise, I'm sold.”</p>
          <p>“Sold! Who's bought you?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know—Master William didn't tell me.”</p>
          <p>“Who's bought her, Mr. Summerville?”</p>
          <pb id="browne316" n="316"/>
          <p>“The man to whom I sold her,” he answered, with a laugh. “But who is he?” persisted Louise, without noticing the joke.</p>
          <p>“Well, Atkins, a negro-trader down here, on Second street.”</p>
          <p>“Good gracious!” she cried out; then, turning to me, said,
“does Henry know it?” </p>
          <p>“I have not seen him.” She darted off from us, and we walked on. I
hoped that she would not see Henry, for I could not bear to meet him.
It would dispossess me of the little forced composure that I had; but,
alas! for the fulfilment of my hopes! in the lower hall, with a
countenance full of terror, he stood.</p>
          <p>“What are you going to do with Ann, Mr. Summerville?” he
inquired.</p>
          <p>“I have sold her to Atkins, and am now taking her to the pen<corr sic="?">.</corr>”</p>
          <p>Alas! though his life, his blood, his soul cried out against it, he dared
not offer any objection or entreaty; but oh, that hopeless look of
brokenness of heart! I see it now, and “it comes over me like the raven
o'er the infected house.”</p>
          <p>“I'll take your trunk round for you, Ann, to-night. It is too heavy for
you,” and so saying, he kindly removed it from my shoulder. This little
act of kindness was the added drop to the already full glass, and my
heart overflowed. I wept heartily. His tender, “don't cry, Ann,” only
made me weep the more; and when I looked up and saw his own eyes
full of tears, and his lip quivering with the unspoken pang, I felt (for the
slave it least) how wretched a possession is life!</p>
          <p>Master William cut short this parting interview, by saying,</p>
          <p>“Never mind that trunk, Henry, Ann can carry it very well.”</p>
          <p>And, as I was about to re-shoulder it, Henry said,</p>
          <p>“No, Ann, you mustn't carry it. I'll do it for you to-night, when my
work is over. She is a woman, Mr. Summerville, and it's heavy for her;
but it will not be anything for me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, if you have a  mind to, you may do it; but I haven't any time
to parley now, come on.”</p>
          <pb id="browne317" n="317"/>
          <p>Henry pressed my hand affectionately, and I saw the tears roll in a
stream down his bronzed cheeks. I did not trust myself to speak; I
merely returned the pressure of his hand, and silently followed Master
William.</p>
          <p>Through the streets, up one and across another, we went, until
suddenly we stopped in front of a two-story brick house with an iron
fence in front. Covering a small portion of the front view of the main
building, an office had been erected, a plain, uncarpeted room, from the
door of which projected a sheet-iron sign, advertising the passers-by,
“negroes bought and sold here.” We walked into this room, and upon the table found a small bell, which Mr. Summerville rang. In answer to this,
a neatly-dressed negro boy appeared. To Master William's
interrogatory, “Is Mr. Atkins in?” he answered, most obsequiously that
he was, and instantly withdrew. In a few moments the door opened,
and a heavy man about five feet ten inches entered. He was of a most
forbidding appearance; a tan-colored complexion, with very black hair
and whiskers, and mean, watery, milky, diseased-looking eyes. He
limped as he walked, one leg being shorter than the other, and carried a
huge stick to assist his ambulations.</p>
          <p>“Good morning, Mr. Atkins.”</p>
          <p>“Good morning, sir,”</p>
          <p>“Here is the girl we were speaking of yesterday.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” replied the other, as he removed a lighted cigar from his
mouth, “she is likely enough. Take off yer bonnet, girl, let me look at
yer eyes. They are good; open your mouth—no decayed teeth—all
sound; hold up your 'coat, legs are good, some marks on 'em—now
the back—pretty much and badly scarred. Well, what's the damage?”</p>
          <p>“Seven hundred, cash down. You can recommend her as a first-rate
house and lady's maid.”</p>
          <p>“What's your name, girl?”</p>
          <p>“Ann,” I replied.</p>
          <p>“Ann, go within,” he added, pointing to the door through which
he had entered.</p>
          <pb id="browne318" n="318"/>
          <p>I turned to Mr. Summerville, saying,</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Master William<corr>.</corr> I wish you well.”</p>
          <p>“Good-bye, Ann,” and he extended his hand to me; “I hope
Mr. Atkins will get you a good home.”</p>
          <p>Dropping a courtesy and a tear, I passed through the door designated
by Mr. Atkins, and stood within the pen. Here I
was met by the mulatto who had answered the bell.</p>
          <p>“Has you bin bought, Miss?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Mr. Atkins just bought me.”</p>
          <p>“Why did your Masser sell you?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, that's what the most of 'em says. It 'pears so quare ter me for a
Masser to sell good sarvants;  but I guess you'll soon git a home; fur
you is 'bout the likeliest yaller gal I ever seed. Now, thim rale black 'uns
hardly ever goes off here. We has to send 'em down river, or let 'em go
at a mighty low price.”</p>
          <p>“How often do you have sales?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, we don't have 'em at all. That's we don't have public
 uns. We sells 'em privately like; but we buys up more; and when we
gits a large number, we ships 'em down de river.”</p>
          <p>Wishing to cut short his garrulity, I asked him to show me the room
where I was to stay.</p>
          <p>“In here, wid de rest of 'em,” he said, as he opened the door of a large shed-room, where I found some ten or twelve negroes, women and men,
ranged round on stools and chairs, all neatly dressed, some of them
looking very happy, others with downcast, sorrow-stricken
countenances.</p>
          <p>One bright, gold-colored man, with long, silky black hair, and raven
eyes, full of subdued power, stood leaning his elbow against the mantel.
His melancholy face and pensive attitude struck a responsive feeling,
and I turned with a sisterly sentiment toward him.</p>
          <p>I have always been of a taciturn disposition, shunning company; but
this man impressed me so favorably, he seemed the very counterpart of
myself, that I forgot my usual
<pb id="browne319" n="319"/>
reserve, and, after a few moments' investigation of my companions, the
faces of most of whom were unpleasant to me, I approached him and
inquired—</p>
          <p>“Have you been long here?”</p>
          <p>“Only a few days,” he answered, as he lifted his mournful eyes
towards mine, and I could see from their misty light, that they were
dimmed by tears.</p>
          <p>“Are you sold?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh yes,” and he shuddered terribly.</p>
          <p>I did not venture to say more; but stood looking at him, when,
suddenly he turned to me, saying,</p>
          <p>“I know that you are sold.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I replied, with that strong sort of courage that characterized
me.</p>
          <p>“You take it calmly,” he said; “have you no friends?”</p>
          <p>“You do not talk like one familiar with slavery, to speak of a slave's
having friends.”</p>
          <p>“True, true; but I have—oh, God!—a wife and children, and from
them I was cruelly torn, and—and—and I saw my poor wife knocked
flat upon the floor, and because I had the manhood to say that it was
wrong, they tied me up and slashed me. All this is right, because my
skin is darker than theirs.”</p>
          <p>“What a fearful groan he gave, as he struck his breast violently.</p>
          <p>“The bitterness of all this I too have tasted, and my only wonder is,
that I can live on. My heart will not break.”</p>
          <p>“Mine has long since broken; but this body will not die. My poor
children! I would that they were dead with their poor slave-mother.”</p>
          <p>“Why did your master sell you?”</p>
          <p>“Because he wanted <hi rend="italics">to buy a piano for his daughter</hi>,” and his lip
curled.</p>
          <p>To gratify the taste of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> child, that white man had separated a
father from his children, had recklessly sundered the holiest ties, and
broken the most solemn and loving domestic attachments; and to such
heathenism the public gave its hearty
<pb id="browne320" n="320"/>
approval, because his complexion was a shade or so darker than
Caucasians. Oh, Church of Christ! where is thy warning voice? Is not
this a matter, upon the injustice of which thy great voice should
pronounce a malison?</p>
          <p>“My name, is Charles, what is yours?”</p>
          <p>“Ann.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann,” he resumed, “I like your face; you are the only one I've seen in this pen that I was willing to talk with. You have just come.
Tell me why were you sold?”</p>
          <p>In a few concise words I told him my story. He seemed touched
with sympathy.</p>
          <p>“Poor girl!” he murmured, “like all the rest of our tribe, you have
tasted of trouble.”</p>
          <p>I talked with him all the morning, and we both, I think, learned what
a relief it is to unclose the burdened heart to a congenial, listening spirit.</p>
          <p>When we were summoned out to our dinner, I found a very bountiful
and pretty good meal served up. It is the policy of the trader to feed the
slaves well; for, as Mr. Atkins said, “the fat, oily, smooth, cheerful
ones, always sold the best;” and, as this business is purely a
speculation, they do everything, even humane things, for the
furtherance of their mercenary designs. I had not much appetite, neither
had Charles, as was remarked by some of the coarser and more abject
of our companions; and I was pained to observe their numerous
significant winks and blinks. One of them, the old gray mouse of the
company, an ancient “Uncle Ned,” who had taken it pretty roughly all
his days, and who being of the lower order of Epicureans, was, perhaps,
happier at the pen than he had ever been. And this fellow, looking at me
and Charley, said,</p>
          <p>“They's in lub;”ha! ha! ha! went round the circle. I noticed
Charley's brows knitting severely. I read his thoughts.
I knew that he was thinking of his poor wife and his fatherless
children, and inwardly swearing unfaltering devotion to them.</p>
          <p>Persuasively I said to him, “Don't mind them. They are
scarcely accountable.”</p>
          <pb id="browne321" n="321"/>
          <p>“I know it, I know it,” he bitterly replied, “but I little thought I
should ever come to this. Sold to a negro-trader, and locked up in a pen
with such a set! I've always had pride; tried to behave myself well, and
to make money for my master, and now to be sold to a trader, away
from my wife and children!” He shook his head and burst into tears. I
felt that I had no words to console him, and I ventured to offer none.</p>
          <p>I managed, by aid of conversation with Charley, to pass the
day tolerably. There may be those of my readers who will
ask how this could be. But let them remember that I had
never been the pampered pet, the child of indulgence; but that
I was born to the ignominious heritage of American slavery.
My feelings had been daily, almost hourly, outraged. This
evil had not fallen on me as the <hi rend="italics">first</hi> misfortune, but as one of a
series of linked troubles “long drawn out.” So I was comparatively
fitted for endurance, though by no means stoical; for
a certain constitutional softness of temperament rendered me
always susceptible of anguish to a very high degree. At
length evening drew on—the beautiful twilight that was written
down so pleasantly in my memory; the time that had always
heralded my re-union with Henry. Now, instead of a sweet
starlight or moonlight stroll, I must betake myself to a narrow,
“cribbed, cabined, and confined” apartment, through which no
truant ray or beam could force an entrance! How my soul
sickened over the recollections of lovelier hours! Whilst I
moodily sat in one corner of the room, hugging to my soul the
thought of him from whom I was now forever parted, a sound
broke on my ear, a sound—a music-sound, that made my nerves
thrill and my blood tingle; 'twas the sound of Henry's voice.
I heard him ask—</p>
          <p>“Where is she? let me speak to her but a single word;” and how that
mellow voice trembled with the burden of painful emotion! Eagerly I
sprang forward; reserve and maidenly coyness all forgotten. My only
wish was to lay my weary head upon that brave, protecting breast—
weep, ay, and die there! “Oh, for a swift death,” I frantically cried, as
I felt his arms
<pb id="browne322" n="322"/>
about me, while my head was pillowed just above his warm and loving
heart. I felt its manly pulsations as with a soft lullaby they seemed
hushing me to the deep, eternal sleep, which I so ardently craved!
Better, a thousand times, for death to part us, than the white man's
cruelty! So we both thought. I read his secret wish in the hopeless,
vacant, but still so agonized look, that he bent upon me. For one
moment, the other slaves huddled together in blank amazement. This
was to them “a show,” as “uncle Ned” subsequently styled it.</p>
          <p>“I've brought your trunk, Ann; Mr. Atkins ordered me to leave it
without; though you'll get it.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Henry; it is of small account to me now: yet there are
in it some few of your gifts that I shall always value.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, don't, pray don't talk so mournfully! Is there no hope?
Can't you be sold somewhere in the city? I have got about fifty dollars
now in money. I'd stop buying myself, and buy you; make my
instalments in fifties or hundreds, as I could raise it; but I spoke to a
lawyer about it, and he read the law to me, showing that I, as a slave,
couldn't be allowed to hold property; and there is no white man in
whom I have sufficient confidence, or who would be willing to
accommodate me in this way. Mine is a deplorable case; but I'm going
to see what can be done. I'll look about among the citizens, to see if
some of them will not buy you; for I cannot be separated from you. It
will kill me; it will, it will!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't, Henry, don't! for myself I can stand much; but when I
think of <hi rend="italics">you</hi>.”</p>
          <p>He caught me passionately to his breast; and, in that embrace, he
seemed to say, “<hi rend="italics">They shall not part us!</hi>”</p>
          <p>He seated himself on a low stool beside me, with one of my hands
clasped in his, and thus, with his tender eyes bent upon me, such is the
illusion of love, I forgot the terror by which I was surrounded, and
yielded myself to a fascination as absorbing as that which encircled me
in the grove on that memorable Sunday evening<corr>.</corr></p>
          <pb id="browne323" n="323"/>
          <p>“Why, Henry, is this you?” and a strong hand was laid upon his
shoulder. Looking up, I beheld Charley.</p>
          <p>“And is this you, Charles Allen?” asked the other.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Yes, this is me.</hi> I dare say you scarcely expected to find me here,
where I never thought I should be.”</p>
          <p>At this I was reminded of the significant ejaculation that Ophelia
makes in her madness, “Lord, we know what we are, but we know not
what we may be!”</p>
          <p>“I am sold, Henry,” continued Charles, “sold away from my poor
wife and children;” his voice faltered and the big tears rolled down his
cheeks.</p>
          <p>“I see from your manner toward Ann, that she is or was expected to
be your wife.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, she was pledged to be.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Yes, and is,</hi>” I added with fervor. At this, Henry only pressed my
hand tightly.</p>
          <p>“Yet,” pursued Charles, “she is taken from you.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">She is,</hi>” was the brief and bitter reply.</p>
          <p>“Now, Henry Graham, are we men? and do we submit to these
things?”</p>
          <p>“Alas!” and the words came through Henry's set teeth, “we are <hi rend="italics">not</hi>
men; we are only chattels, property, merchandise, <hi rend="italics">slaves</hi>.”</p>
          <p>“But is it right for us to be so? I feel the high and lordly instincts of
manhood within me. Must I conquer them? Must I stifle the eloquent
cry of Nature in my breast? Shall I see my wife and children left
behind to the mercy of a hard master, and willingly desert them simply
because another man says that, in exchange for this sacrifice of
happiness and hope, <hi rend="italics">his daughter</hi> shall play upon Chickering's finest
piano?”</p>
          <p>“Heavens! can I ever forget the princely air with which he uttered
these words! His swarthy check glowed with a beautiful crimson, and
his rich eye fairly blazed with the fire of a seven-times heated soul,
whilst the thin lip curled and the fine nostril dilated, and the whole
form towered supremely in the majesty of erect and perfect
manhood!</p>
          <pb id="browne324" n="324"/>
          <p>“Hush, Charley, hush,” I urged, “this is no place for the expression
of such sentiments, just and noble as they may be.”</p>
          <p>Again Henry pressed my hand.</p>
          <p>“It may be imprudent, Ann, but I am reckless now. They have done
the worst they can do. I defy the sharpest dagger-point. My breast is
open to a thousand spears. They can do no more. But how can you,
Henry, thus supinely sit by and see yourself robbed of your life's
treasure? I cannot understand it. Are you lacking in manliness, in
courage? Are you a coward, a <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> indeed?”</p>
          <p>“Do not listen to him; leave now, Henry, dear, dear Henry,” I
implored, as I observed the singular expression of his face. “Go now,
dearest, without saying another word; for my sake go. You will not
refuse me?”</p>
          <p>“No, I will not, dear Ann; but there is a fire raging in my veins.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, and Charley is the incendiary. Go, I beg you.”</p>
          <p>With a long, fond kiss, he left me, and it was well he did, for in a
moment more Mr. Atkins came to give the order for retiring.</p>
          <p>I found a very comfortable mattress and covering, on the floor of a
good, neatly-carpeted room, which was occupied by five other women.
One of them, a gay girl of about fifteen, a full-blooded African, made her
pallet close to mine. I had observed her during the day as a garrulous,
racketty sort of baggage, that seemed contented with her situation. She
was extremely neat in her dress; and her ebony skin had a rich, oily,
shiny look, resembling the perfect polish of Nebraska blacking on an
exquisite's boot. Partly from their own superiority, but chiefly from
contrast with her complexion, shone white as mountain snow, a regular
row of ivory teeth. Her large flabby ears were adorned by huge wagon-wheel
rings of pinch-beck, and a cumbersome strand of imitation coral
beads adorned her inky throat, whilst her dress was of the gaudiest
colors, plaided in large bars. Thus decked out, she made quite a figure in
the assemblage.</p>
          <pb id="browne325" n="325"/>
          <p>“Is yer name Ann?” she unceremoniously asked.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” was my laconic reply.</p>
          <p>“Mine is Lucy; but they calls me Luce fur short.”</p>
          <p>No answer being made, she garrulously went on:</p>
          <p>“Was that yer husband what comed to see you this evenin'?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>“Your brother?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>“Your cousin?”</p>
          <p>“Neither.”</p>
          <p>“Well, he's too young-lookin' fur yer father. Mought he be yer uncle?”</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>“Laws, then he mus' be yer sweetheart!” and she chuckled with
mirth.</p>
          <p>I made no answer.</p>
          <p>“Why don't you talk, Ann?”</p>
          <p>“I don't feel like it.”</p>
          <p>“You don't? well, that's quare.”</p>
          <p>Still I made no comment. Nothing daunted, she went on:</p>
          <p>“Is yer gwine down the river with the next lot?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know;” but this time I accompanied my reply with a sigh.</p>
          <p>“What you grunt fur?”</p>
          <p>I could not, though so much distressed, resist a laugh at this singular
interrogatory.</p>
          <p>“Don't yer want to go South? I does. They say it's right nice down
dar. Plenty of oranges. When Masser fust sold me, I was mightily
'stressed; den Missis, she told me dat dar was a sight of oranges down
dar, and dat we didn't work any on Sundays, and we was 'lowed to
marry; so I got mightily in de notion of gwine. You see Masser Jones
never 'lowed his black folks to marry. I wanted to marry four, five men,
and he wouldn't let me. Den we had to work all day Sundays; never had
any time to make anyting for ourselves; and I does love oranges! I
never had more an' a quarter of one in my life.”</p>
          <pb id="browne326" n="326"/>
          <p>Thus she wandered on until she fell off to sleep; but the leaden-winged
cherub visited me not that night. My eye-lids refused to close over the
parched and tear-stained orbs. I dully moved from side to side,
changed and altered my position fifty times, yet there was no repose for
me.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Not poppy nor mandragora</l>
            <l>Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,</l>
            <l>Could then medicine me to that sweet sleep</l>
            <l>Which I owed yesterday.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>I saw the dull gray streak of the morning beam, as coldly it played
through the gratings of my room. There, scattered in dismal confusion
over the floor, lay the poor human beings, for whose lives, health and
happiness, save as conducing to the pecuniary advantage of the
trafficker, no thought or care was taken. I rose hastily and adjusted my
dress, for I had not removed it during the night. The noise of my rising
aroused several of the others, and simultaneously they sprang to their
feet, apprehensive that they had slept past the prescribed hour for
rising. Finding that their alarm was groundless, and that they were by
the clock an hour too early, they grumbled a good deal at what they
thought my unnecessary awaking. I would have given much to win to
my heart the easy indifference as to fate, which many of them wore like
a loose glove; but there I was vulnerable at every pore, and wounded at
each. What a curse to a slave's life is a sensitive nature!</p>
          <p>That day closed as had the preceding, save that at evening Henry did
not come as before. I wandered out in the yard, which was surrounded
by a high brick-wall, covered at the top with sharp iron spikes, to
prevent the escape of slaves. Through this barricaded ground I was
allowed to take a little promenade. There was not a shrub or green blade
of grass to enliven me; but my eyes lingered not upon the earth. They
were turned up to the full moon, shining so round and goldenly from
the purple heaven, and, scattered sparsely through the fields of azure,
were a few stars, looking brighter and larger from their scarcity.</p>
          <pb id="browne327" n="327"/>
          <p>“Will my death-hour ever come?” I asked myself despairingly. “Have I not tasted of the worst of life? Is not the poisoned cup drained
to its last dregs?”</p>
          <p>I fancied that I heard a voice answer, as from the clouds,</p>
          <p>“No, there are a few bitterer drops that must yet be drunk. Press the
goblet still closer to your lips.”</p>
          <p>I shuddered coldly as the last tones of the imagined voice died away
upon the soft night air.</p>
          <p>“Is that,” I cried, “a prophet warning? Comes it to me now that I
may gird my soul for the approaching warfare? Let me, then, put on
my helmet and buckler, and, like a life-tired soldier, rush headlong into
the thickest of the fight, praying that the first bullet may prove a friend
and drink my blood!”</p>
          <p>Yet I shrank, like the weakest and most fearful of my race, when the
distant cotton-fields rose upon my mental view! There, beneath the
heat of a “hot and copper sky,” I saw myself wearily tugging at my
assigned task; yet my fear was not for the physical trouble that
awaited me. Had Henry been going, “down the river” would have had
no terror for me; but I was to part from joy, from love, from life itself!
Oh, why, why have we—poor bondsmen and bondswomen—these
fine and delicate sensibilities? Why do we love? Why are we not all
coarse and hard, mere human beasts of burden, with no higher mental
or moral conception, than obedience to the will or caprice of our
owners?</p>
          <p>Night closed over this second weary day. And thus passed on many
days and nights. I did some plain sewing by way of employment, and
at the command of a mulatto woman, who was the kept mistress of
Atkins, and therefore placed in authority over us. Many of the women
were hired out to residents of the city on trial, and if they were found
to be agreeable and good servants, perhaps they were purchased.
Before sending them out, Mr. Atkins always called them to him, and,
shaking his cane over their heads, said,</p>
          <p>“Now, you d—d hussy, or rascal (as they chanced to be male or
female) if you behave yourselves well, you'll find a
<pb id="browne328" n="328"/>
good home; but you dare to get sick or misbehave, and be sent back to
me, and I'll thrash you in an inch of your cursed life.”</p>
          <p>With this demoniacal threat ringing in their ears, it is not likely that
the poor wretches started off with any intention of bad conduct.</p>
          <p>We constantly received accessions to our number, but never
acquisitions, for the poor, ill-fed, ill-kept wretches that came in there,
“sold (as Atkins said) for a mere song,” were desolate and revolting to see.</p>
          <p>Charley found one or two old books, that he seemed to read and re-read;
indifferent novels, perhaps, that served, at least, to keep down
the ravening tortures of thought. I lent him my Testament, and he read
a great deal in it. He said that he had one, but had left it with his wife.
He was a member of the Methodist Church; had gone on Sunday
afternoons to a school that had been established for the benefit of
colored people, and thus, unknown to his master, had acquired the first
principles of a good education. He could read and write, and was in
possession of the rudiments of arithmetic. He told me that his wife had
not had the opportunities he had, and therefore she was more deficient,
but he added, “she had a great thirst for knowledge, such as I have
never seen excelled, and rarely equalled. I have known her, after the
close of her daily labors, devote the better portion of the night to
study. I gave her all the instruction I could, and she was beginning to
read with considerable accuracy; but all that is over, past and gone
now.” And again he ground his teeth fiercely, and a wild, lurid light
gathered in his eye.</p>
          <p>This man almost made me oblivious of my own grief, in sympathy
for his. I did all I could by “moral suasion,” as the politicians say, to
soften his resentment. I bade him turn his thoughts toward that religion
which he had espoused.</p>
          <p>“I have no religion for this,” he would bitterly say.</p>
          <p>And in truth, I fear me much if the heroism of saints would hold out
on such occasions. There, fastened to that impassioned husband's
heart, playing with its dearest chords, was the fang-like
<pb id="browne329" n="329"/>
hand of the white man! Oh, slow tortures! in comparison to which
that of Prometheus was very pleasure. There is no Tartarus like that of
wounded, agonized domestic love! Far away from him, in a lonely
cabin, he beheld his stricken wife and all his “pretty chickens” pining
and unprotected.</p>
          <p>Slowly, after a few days, he relapsed into that stony sort of despair
that denies itself the gratification of speech. The change was very
painfully visible to me, and I tried, by every artifice, to arouse him; but
I had no power to wake him.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Give sorrow words; the grief that does not speak,</l>
            <l>Whispers the o'erfraught heart, and bids it break.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And soon learning this, I left him, a remorseless prey to that
“rooted sorrow” of the brain.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * " unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>One day, as we all sat in the shed-room, engaged at our various
occupations, we were roused by a noise of violent weeping, and
something like a rude scuffle just without the door, when suddenly
Atkins entered, dragging after him, with his hand close about his throat,
a poor negro man, aged and worn, with a head white as cotton.</p>
          <p>“Oh, please, Masser, jist let me go back, an' tell de ole 'ooman
farewell, an' I won't ax for any more.”</p>
          <p>“No, you old rascal, you wants to run away. If you say another
word about the old woman, I'll beat the life out of you.”</p>
          <p>“Oh lor', oh lor', do poor ole 'ooman an' de boys; oh my ole heart
will bust!” and, sobbing like a child, the old man sank down upon the
floor, in the most abandoned grief.</p>
          <p>“Here, boys, some of you git the fiddle and play, an' I warrant that
old fool will be dancin' in a minnit,” said Atkins in his unfeeling way.</p>
          <p>Of course this speech met with the most signal applause from “de
boys” addressed.</p>
          <p>I watched the expression of Charles' face. It was frightful.</p>
          <pb id="browne330" n="330"/>
          <p>He sat in one corner, as usual, with an open book in his hand. From it
he raised his eyes, and, whilst the scene between Atkins and the old
negro was going on, they flashed with an expression that I could not
fathom. His brows knit, and his lip curled, yet he spoke no word.</p>
          <p>When Atkins withdrew, the old man lay there, still weeping and
sobbing piteously. I went up to him, kindly saying,</p>
          <p>“What is the matter, old uncle?”</p>
          <p>The sound of a kind voice aroused him, and looking up through his
streaming tears, he said,</p>
          <p>“Oh, chile, I's got a poor ole 'ooman dat lives 'bout half mile in de
country. Masser fotch me in town to-day, an' say he was agwine to
hire me fur a few weeks. Wal, I beliebed him, bekase Masser has bin
hard run fur money, an' I was willin' to hope him 'long, so I consented
to be hired in town fur little while, and den go out an' see do ole 'ooman an' de boys Saturday nights. Wal, do fust thing I knowed when I got to town I was sold to a trader. Masser wouldn't tell me hisself; but, when I got here, de gemman what I thought I was hired to, tole me dat Masser Atkins had bought me; an' I wanted
to go back an' ask Masser, but he laughed an' say 'twant no use, Masser
done gone out home. Oh, lor'! 'peared like dere was nobody to trus' to
den. I begged to go an' say good-bye; but dey 'fused me dat, an' Masser
Atkins 'gan to swear, an' he struck me 'cross de head. Oh, I didn't tink
Masser wud do me so in my ole age!”</p>
          <p>I ask you, reader, if for a sorrow like this there was any word of
comfort? I thought not, and did not dare try to offer any.</p>
          <p>“Will scenes like these ever cease?” I fretfully asked, as I turned to
Charles.</p>
          <p>“Never!” was the bitter answer.</p>
          <p>This old man talked constantly of his little woolly-headed boys.
When telling of their sportive gambols, he would smile, even whilst the
tears were flowing down his cheeks.</p>
          <p>He often had a crowd of slaves around him listening to his
<pb id="browne331" n="331"/>
talk of “wife and children,” but I seldom made one of the number, for it
saddened me too much. I knew that he was telling of joys that could
never come to him again.</p>
          <p>On one of these occasions, when uncle Peter, as he was called, was
deep in the merits of his conversation, I was sitting in the corner of the
room sewing, when Luce came running breathlessly up to me, with a
bunch of beautiful flowers in her hand.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann,” she exclaimed, “dat likely-lookin' yallow man, dat cum to see you, an' fotch yer trunk de fust night yer comed here, was passin'
by, an' I was stanin' at de gate; an' he axed me to han' dis to you.”</p>
          <p>And she gave me the bouquet, which I took, breathing a thousand
blessings upon the head of my devoted Henry.</p>
          <p>I had often wondered why Louise had never been to see me. She
knew very well where I was, and access to me was easy. But I was not
long kept in suspense, for, on that very night she came, bringing with
her a few sweetmeats, which I distributed among those of my
companions who felt more inclined to eat them than I did.</p>
          <p>“I have wondered, Louise, why you did not come sooner.”</p>
          <p>“Well, the fact is, Ann, I've been busy trying to find you a home. I
couldn't bear to come without bringing you good news. Henry and I
have worked hard. All of our leisure moments have been devoted to it.
We have scoured this city over, but with no success; and, hearing
yesterday that Mr. Atkins would start down the river to-morrow, with
all of you, I could defer coming no longer. Poor Henry is too much
distressed to come! He says he'll not sleep this night, but will ransack
the city till he finds somebody able and willing to rescue you.”</p>
          <p>“How does he look?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Six years older than when you saw him last. He takes this very
hard; has lost his appetite, and can't sleep at night.”</p>
          <p>I said nothing; but my heart was full, full to overflowing. I
<pb id="browne332" n="332"/>
longed to be alone, to fall with my face on the earth and weep. The
presence of Louise restrained me, for I always shrank from exposing my
feelings.</p>
          <p>“Are we going to-morrow?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Mr. Atkins told me so this evening. Did you not know of it?”</p>
          <p>“No, indeed; am I among the lot?”</p>
          <p>After a moment's hesitation she replied,</p>
          <p>“Yes, he told me that you were, and, on account of your beauty, he expected you would bring a good price in the Southern market. Ho heavens, Ann,
this is too dreadful to repeat; yet you will have to know of it.”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, yes;” and I could no longer restrain myself; I fell,
weeping, in her arms.</p>
          <p>She could not remain long with me, for Mr. Atkins closed up
the establishment at half-past nine. Bidding me an affectionate
farewell, and assuring me that she would, with Henry, do all
that could be done for my relief, she left me.</p>
          <p>A most wretched, phantom-peopled night was that! Ten thousand
horrors haunted me! Of course I slept none; but imagination
seemed turned to a fiend, and torture me in <sic corr="diverse">divers</sic> ways.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>SCENE IN THE PEN—STARTING “DOWN THE RIVER”—UNCLE PETER'S TRIAL—MY RESCUE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ON the next day, after breakfast, Mr. Atkins came in, saying,</p>
          <p>“Well, niggers, git yourselves ready. You must all start down the river to-day,
at ten o'clock. A good boat is going out. Huddle up your clothes as
quick as possible—no fuss, now.”</p>
          <p>When he left, there was lamentation among some; silent mourning
with others; joy for a few.</p>
          <p>Shall I ever forget the despairing look of Charley? How
passionately he compressed his lips! I went up to him, and, laying my
hand on his arm, said,</p>
          <p>“Let us be strong to meet the trouble that is sent us!”</p>
          <p>He looked at me, but made no reply. I thought there was the
wildness of insanity in his glance, and turned away.</p>
          <p>It was now eight o'clock, and I had not heard from Henry or Louise.
Alas! my heart misgave me. I had been buoyed up for some time by
the flatteries and delusions of Hope! but now I felt that I had nothing
to sustain me; the last plank had sunk!</p>
          <p>I did not pretend to “get myself ready,” as Mr. Atkins had directed;
the fact is, I was ready. The few articles of wearing apparel that I called
mine were all in my trunk, with some little presents that Henry had
made me, such as a brooch, earrings, &amp;c. These were safely locked, and
the key hung round my neck. But the others were busy “getting
ready.” I was standing near the door, anxiously hoping to see either
Henry or Louise, when an old negro woman, thinly clad, without any
bonnet on her head, and with a basket in her hand, came up to me,
saying,</p>
          <pb id="browne334" n="334"/>
          <p>“Please mam, is my ole man in here? De massa out here say I may
speak long wid him, and say farwell;” and she wiped her eyes with the
corner of an old torn check apron.</p>
          <p>I was much touched, and asked her the name of her old man.</p>
          <p>“Pete, mam.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, he is within,” and I stepped aside to let her pass through
the door.</p>
          <p>She went hobbling along, making her passage through the crowd, and
I followed after. In a few moments Pete saw her.</p>
          <p>“Oh dear! oh dear!” he cried out, “Judy is come;” and running up to her, he embraced her most affectionately.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” she said, “I begged Masser to let me come and see you. It was long time before he told me dat you was sole to a trader and gwine
down do ribber. Oh, Lord! it 'pears like I ken never git usin to it! Dars
no way for me ever to hear from you. You kan't write, neither ken I.
Oh, what shill we do?”</p>
          <p>“I doesn't know, Judy, we's in do hands ob de Lord. We mus' trus' to
Him. Maybe He'll save us. Keep on prayin', Judy.”</p>
          <p>The old man's voice grew very feeble, as he asked,</p>
          <p>“An de chillen, de boys, how is dey?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, dey is well. Sammy wanted to come long 'wid me; but it was
too fur for him to walk. Joe gib me dis, and say, take it to daddy from
me.”</p>
          <p>She looked in her basket, and drew out a little painted cedar whistle.
The tears rolled down the old man's cheeks as he took it, and, looking
at it, he shook his head mournfully,</p>
          <p>“Poor boy, dis is what I give him fur a Christmas gift, an' he sot a
great store to it. Only played wid it of Sundays and holidays, No, take
it back to him, an' tell him to play wid it, and never ever forget his poor
ole daddy dat's sole 'way down de ribber!”</p>
          <p>Here he fairly broke down, and, bursting into tears, wept aloud.</p>
          <p>“Oh, God hab bin marciful to me in lettin' me see you, Judy, once
agin! an' I am an ongrateful sinner not to bar up better.”</p>
          <p>Judy was weeping violently.</p>
          <p>“Oh, if dey would but buy me! I wants to go long wid you.”</p>
          <pb id="browne335" n="335"/>
          <p>“No, no, Judy, you must stay long wid de chillen, an' take
kere ob em. Besides, you is not strong enough to do de work
dey would want you to do. No, I had better go by myself,” and
he wiped his eyes with his old coat sleeve.</p>
          <p>“I wish,” he added, “dat I had some little present to send de boys,” and, fumbling away in his pocket, he at length drew out two shining
brass buttons that he had picked up in the yard.</p>
          <p>“Give dis to 'em; say it was all thor ale daddy had to spend
'em; but, maybe, some time I'll have some money; and if I
meet any friends down de ribber, I'll send it to 'em, and git a
letter writ back to let you and 'em know whar I is sold.”</p>
          <p>Judy opened her basket, and handed him a small bundle.</p>
          <p>“Here, Pete, is a couple of shirts and a par of trowsers I 
fetched you, and here's a good par of woollen socks t okeep you
warm in de winter; and dis is one of Masser's ole woollen
undershirts dat Missis sent you. You know how you allers suffers
in cold wedder wid de rheumatiz.”</p>
          <p>“Tell Missis thankee,” and his voice was choking in his throat.</p>
          <p>There was many a tearful eye among the company, looking at this
little scene. But, suddenly it was broken up by the appearance of Mr.
Atkins.</p>
          <p>“Well, ole woman,” he began, addressing Uncle Pete's wife,
“it is time you was agoin'. You has staid long enough. Thar's no use in
makin' a fuss. Pete belongs to me, an' I am agoin' to sell him to the
highest bidder I can find down the river.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Masser, won't you please buy me?” asked Judy.</p>
          <p>“No, you old fool.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, hush Judy, pray hush,” put in Pete; “humor her a little Masser Atkins, she will go in a minnit. Now do go, honey,” he added,
addressing Judy, who stood a moment, irresolutely,
regarding her old husband; then screaming out, “Oh no, no, I can't
leave you!” fell down at his feet half insensible.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Lord Jesus, hab marcy!” groaned Pete, as he bent over his
partner's body.</p>
          <pb id="browne336" n="336"/>
          <p>“Take her out, instantly,” exclaimed Atkins, as one of the men
dragged the body out.</p>
          <p>“Please be kereful, don't hurt her,” implored Pete.</p>
          <p>“Behave yourself, and don't go near her,” said Atkins to him, “or I'll have both you an' her flogged. I am not goin' to have these fusses in my pen.”</p>
          <p>All this time Charley's face was frightful. As Atkins passed along he
looked toward Charley, and I thought he quailed before him. That regal
face, of the mulatto man was well calculated to awe such a sinister and
small soul as Atkins.</p>
          <p>“Yes, yes, Charles, that proud spirit of yourn will git pretty well
broken down in the cotton fields,” he murmured, just loud enough to be
heard. Charles made no answer, though I observed that his cheek fairly
blazed.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>When we were all bonneted, trunks corded down, and bundles tied
up, waiting, in the shed-room, for the order to get in the omnibus,
Uncle Pete suddenly spied the basket which Judy, in her insensibility,
had left. Picking it up, I saw the tears glitter in his eyes when the two
bright buttons rolled out on the floor.</p>
          <p>“These puttys,” he muttered to himself, “was fur de boys. Poor
fellows! Now dey won't have any keepsake from dar daddy; and den
here's de little cedar whistle; oh, I wish I could send it out to 'em.”
Looking round the room he saw Kitty, the mulatto woman, of whom I
have before spoken as the mistress of Atkins.</p>
          <p>“Oh, please, Kitty, will you have dis basket, dis whistle, and dese
putty buttons, sent out to Mr. John Jones', to my ole 'ooman Judy?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” answered the woman, “I will.”</p>
          <p>“Thankee mam, and you'll very much oblige me.”</p>
          <p>“Come 'long with you all. The omnibus is ready,” cried out Atkins,
and we all took up the line of march for the door,
<pb id="browne337" n="337"/>
each pausing to say good-bye to Kitty, and yet none caring much for
her, as she had not been agreeable to us.</p>
          <p>“Going down the river, really,” I said to myself.</p>
          <p>“Wait a minnit,” said Atkins, and calling to a sort of foreman, who
did his roughest work, he bade him handcuff us.</p>
          <p>How fiercely-proud looked the face of Charles, as they fastened the
manacles on his wrists.</p>
          <p>I made no complaint, nor offered resistance. My heart was
maddened. I almost blamed Louise, and chided Henry for not forcing
my deliverance. I could have broken the handcuffs, so strongly was I
possessed by an unnatural power.</p>
          <p>“Git in the 'bus,” said the foreman, as he riveted on the last
handcuff.</p>
          <p>Just as I had taken my seat in the omnibus, Henry came frantically
rushing up. The great beads of perspiration stood upon his brow; and
his thick, hard breathing, was frightful. Sinking down upon the ground,
all he could say was,</p>
          <p>“Ann! Ann!”</p>
          <p>I rose and stood erect in the omnibus, looking at him, but dared not
move one step toward him.</p>
          <p>“What is the matter with that nigger?” inquired Atkins, pointing
toward Henry. Then addressing the driver, he bade him drive down to
the wharf.</p>
          <p>“Stop! stop!” exclaimed Henry; “in Heaven's name stop, Mr.
Atkins, here's a gentleman coming to buy Ann. Wait a moment.”</p>
          <p>Just then a tall, grave-looking man, apparently past forty, walked
up.</p>
          <p>“Who the d—l is that?” gruffly asked Mr. Atkins.</p>
          <p>“It is Mr. Moodwell,” Henry replied. “He has come to buy Ann.”</p>
          <p>“Who said that I wanted to sell her?”</p>
          <p>“You would let her go for a fair price, wouldn't you?”</p>
          <p>“No, but I would part with her for a first-rate one.”</p>
          <p>Just then, as hope began to relume my soul, Mr. Moodwell
approached Atkins, saying,</p>
          <pb id="browne338" n="338"/>
          <p>“I wish to buy a yellow girl of you.”</p>
          <p>“Which one?”</p>
          <p>“A girl by the name of Ann. Where is she?”</p>
          <p>“Don't you know her by sight?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly not, for I have never seen her.”</p>
          <p>“You don't want to buy without first seeing her?”</p>
          <p>“I take her upon strong recommendation.”</p>
          <p>With a dogged, and I fancied disappointed air, Atkins bade me stand
forth. Right willingly I obeyed; and appearing before Mr. Moodwell,
with a smiling, hopeful face, I am not surprised that he was pleased
with me, and readily paid down the price of a thousand dollars that was
demanded by Atkins. When I saw the writings drawn up, and became
aware that I had passed out of the trader's possession, and could remain
near Henry, I lifted my eyes to Heaven, breathing out an ardent act of
adoration and gratitude.</p>
          <p>Quickly Henry stood beside me, and clasping my yielding hand
within his own, whispered,</p>
          <p>“You are safe, dear Ann.”</p>
          <p>I had no words wherewith to express my thankfulness; but the
happy tears that glistened in my eyes, and the warm pressure of the
hand that I gave, assured him of the sincerity of any gratitude.</p>
          <p>My trunk was very soon taken down from the top of the omnibus
and shouldered by Henry.</p>
          <p>Looking up at my companions, I beheld the savagely-stern
face of Charles; and thinking of his troubles, I blamed myself for having
given up to selfish joy, when such agony was within my sight. I rushed
up to the side of the omnibus and extended my hand to him.</p>
          <p>“God has taken care of you,” he said, with a groan, “but I am
forgotten!”</p>
          <p>“Don't despair of His mercy, Charley.” More I could not say; for
the order was given them to start, and the heavy vehicle rolled
away.</p>
          <pb id="browne339" n="339"/>
          <p>As I turned toward Henry he remarked the shadow upon my brow,
and tenderly inquired the cause.</p>
          <p>“I am distressed for Charley.”</p>
          <p>“Poor fellow! I would that I had the power to relieve him.”</p>
          <p>“Come on, come on,” said Mr. Moodwell, and we followed him to
the G— House, where I found Louise, anxiously waiting for me.</p>
          <p>“You are safe, thank Heaven!” she exclaimed, and joyful tears were
rolling down her smooth checks.</p>
          <p>The reaction of feeling was too powerful for me, and my health sank
under it. I was very ill for several weeks, with fever. Louise and Henry
nursed me faithfully. Mr. Moodwell had purchased me for a maiden
sister of his, who was then travelling in the Southern States, and I was
left at the G— House until I should get well, at which time, if she should
not have returned, I was to be hired out until she came. I recollect well
when I first opened my eyes, after an illness of weeks. I was lying on a
nice bed in Louise's room. As it was a cool evening in the early October,
there was a small comfort-diffusing fire burning in the grate; and on a
little stand, beside my bed, was a very pretty and fragrant bouquet.
Seated near me, with my hand in his, was the one being on earth whom I
best loved. He was singing in a low, musical tone, the touching
Ethiopian melody of “Old Folks at Home.” Slowly my eyes opened
upon the pleasant scene! Looking into his deep, witching eyes, I
murmured low, whilst my hand returned the pressure of his,</p>
          <p>“Is it you, dear Henry?”</p>
          <p>“It is I, my love; I have just got through with my work, and I came
to see you. Finding you asleep, I sat down beside you to hum a
favorite air; but I fear, that instead of calming, I have broken your
slumber, sweet.”</p>
          <p>“No, dearest, I am glad to be aroused. I feel so much better than I
have felt for weeks. My head is free from fever, and except for the
absence of strength, am as well as I ever was.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, it makes me really happy to hear you say so. I have been so
uneasy about you. The doctor was afraid of
<pb id="browne340" n="340"/>
congestion of the brain. You cannot know how I suffered in mind about
you; but now your flesh feels cool and pleasant, and your strength will,
I trust, soon return.”</p>
          <p>Just then Louise entered, bearing a cup of tea and a nice brown slice
of toast, and a delicate piece of chicken, on a neat little salver. At sight
of this dainty repast, my long-forgotten appetite returned, with a most
healthful vigor. But my kind nurse, who was glad to find me so well,
determined to keep me so, and would not allow me a hearty indulgence
of appetite.</p>
          <p>In a few days I was able to sit up in an easy chair, and, at every
opportunity, Louise would amuse me with some piece of pleasant
gossip, in relation to the boarders, &amp;c. And Henry, my good, kind,
noble Henry, spent all his spare change in buying oranges and pine-apples
for me, and in sending rare bouquets, luxuries in which I took
especial delight. Then, during the long, cheerful autumnal evenings,
when a fire sparkled in the grate, he would, after his work was done
bring his banjo and play for me; whilst his rich, gushing voice warbled
some old familiar song. Its touching plaintiveness often brought the
tears to my eyes.</p>
          <p>Thus passed a few weeks pleasantly enough for me; but like all the
other rose-winged hours, they soon had a close.</p>
          <p>My strength had been increasing rapidly, and Mr. Moodwell, the
brother and agent of my mistress, concluded that I was strong enough
to be hired out. Accordingly, he apprized me of his intention, saying,</p>
          <p>“Ann, sister Nancy has written me word to hire you out until spring,
when she will return and take you home. I have selected a place for you,
in the capacity of house-servant. You must behave yourself well.”</p>
          <p>I assured him that I would do my best; then asked the name of the
family to whom I was hired.</p>
          <p>“To Josiah Smith, on Chestnut street, I have hired you. He has two
daughters and a young niece living with him, and wishes you to wait on
them.”</p>
          <p>After apprizing Henry and Louise of my new home, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">pro tem.,</hi></foreign>
<pb id="browne341" n="341"/>
I requested the former to bring my trunk out that night, which he
readily promised. Bidding them a kind and cheerful <foreign lang="fre">adieu</foreign>, I followed
Mr. Moodwell out to Chestnut street.</p>
          <p>This is one of the most retired and beautiful streets in the city of L—,
and Mr. Josiah Smith's residence the very handsomest among a
number of exceedingly elegant mansions.</p>
          <p>Opening a bronze gate, we passed up a broad tesselated stone walk
that led to the house, which was built of pure white stone, and three
stories in height, with an observatory on the top, and the front
ornamented with a richly-wrought iron verandah.
Reposing in front upon the sward, were two couchant tigers of dark
gray stone.</p>
          <p>Passing through the verandah, we stopped at the mahogany door
until Mr. Moodwell pulled the silver bell-knob, which was speedily
answered by a neatly-dressed man-servant, who bade Mr. Moodwell
walk in the parlor, and requested me to wait without the door until he
could find leisure to attend to me. </p>
          <p>I obeyed this direction, and amused myself examining what remained
of a very handsome flower-garden, until he returned, when conducting
me around, by a private entrance, he ushered me into the kitchen.</p>

LOVE—MEETINGS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I BECAME domesticated very soon in Mr. Josiah Smith's family. I
learned what my work was, and did it very faithfully, and I believe to
their satisfaction.</p>
          <p>The family proper consisted of Mr. Smith, his wife, two daughters,
and a niece. Mr. Smith was a merchant, of considerable wealth and
social influence, and the young ladies were <foreign lang="fre">belles par-excellence</foreign>. Mrs. Smith was the domestic of the concern, who carried on the
establishment, a little, busy, fussy sort of woman, that went sailing it
round the house with a huge bunch of keys dangling at her side, an
incessant scold, with a voice sharp and clear like a steamboat bell; a
managing, thrifty sort of person, a perfect terror to negroes; up of a
morning betimes, and in the kitchen, fussing with the cook about
breakfast.</p>
          <p>I had very little to do with Mrs. Letitia. My business was almost
exclusively with the young ladies. I cleaned and arranged their rooms,
set the parlors right, swept and dusted them, and then attended to the
dining-room. This part of my work threw me under Mrs. Letitia's
dynasty; but as I generally did my task well, she had not much
objection to make, though her natural fault-finding disposition
sharpened her optics a good deal, and she generally discovered
something about which to complain.</p>
          <p>Miss Adele Smith was the elder of the two daughters, a tall, pale girl,
with dark hair, carefully banded over a smooth, polished brow, large
black eyes and a pleasing manner.</p>
          <pb id="browne343" n="343"/>
          <p>The second, Miss Nellie, was a round, plump girl of blonde
complexion, fair hair and light eyes, with a rich peach-flush on her
check, and a round, luscious, cherry-red mouth, that was always curling
and curvetting with smiles.</p>
          <p>The cousin, Lulu Carey, was a real romantic character, with a light,
fragile form, milk-white skin, the faintest touch of carmine playing over
the cheek, mellow gray eyes, earnest and loving, and a profusion of
chestnut-brown hair fell in the richest ringlets to her waist. Her features
and caste of face were perfect. She was habited in close mourning, for
her mother had been dead but one year, and the half-perceptible shadow
of grief that hung over her face, form and manner, rendered her glorious
beauty even more attractive.</p>
          <p>It was a real pleasure to me to serve these young ladies, for though
they were the élite, the cream of the aristocracy, they were without
those offensive “airs” that render the fashionable society of the West so reprehensible. Though their parlors were filled every evening with the
gayest company, and they were kept up late, they always came to their
rooms with pleasant smiles and gracious words, and often chided me for
remaining out of bed.</p>
          <p>“Don't wait for us, Ann,” they would say. “It isn't right to keep you from your rest on our account.”</p>
          <p>I slept on a pallet in their chamber, and took great delight in
remaining up until they came, and then assisted them in disrobing.</p>
          <p>It was the first time I had ever known white ladies (and young) to be
amiable, and seemingly philanthropic, and of course a very powerful
interest was excited for them. They had been educated in Boston, and
had imbibed some of the liberal and generous principles that are, I think,
indigenous to high Northern latitudes. Indeed, I believe Miss Lulu
strongly inclined toward their social and reformatory doctrines, though
she did not dare give them any very open expression, for Mr. and Mrs.
Josiah Smith were strong pro-slavery, conservative people, and would
not have countenanced any dissent from their opinions.</p>
          <pb id="browne344" n="344"/>
          <p>Mrs. Smith used to say, “Niggers ought to be exterminated.” And
Miss Lulu, in her quiet way, would reply,</p>
          <p>“Yes, as slaves they should be exterminated.”</p>
          <p>And then how pretty and naïvely she arched her pencilled brows.
This was always understood by the sisters, who must have shared her
liberal views.</p>
          <p>Mr. Smith was so much absorbed in mercantile matters, that he
seldom came home, except at meals or late at night, when the household
was wrapped in sleep; and, even on Sundays, when all the world took
rest, he was locked up in his counting-room. This seemed singular to me,
for a man of Mr. Smith's reputed and apparent wealth might have found
time, at least on Sunday, for quiet.</p>
          <p>The young ladies were very prompt and regular in their attendance
at church, but I used often to hear Miss Lulu exclaim, after returning,</p>
          <p>“Why don't they give us something new? These old rags of theology
weary, not to say annoy me. If Christianity is marching so rapidly on,
why have we still, rising up in our very midst, institutions the vilest
and most revolting! Why are we cursed with slavery? Why have we
houses of prostitution, where beauty is sold for a price? Why have we
pest and alms-houses? Who is the poor man's friend? Who is there
with enough of Christ's spirit to speak kindly to the Magdalene, and bid
her  go and sin no more'? Alas, for Christianity to-day!”</p>
          <p>“But we must accept life as it is, and patiently wait the coming of the
millennium, when things will be as they ought,” was Miss Adele's
reply.</p>
          <p>“Oh, now coz, don't you and sis go to speculating upon life's
troubles, but come and tell me what I shall wear to the party to-morrow
night,” broke from the gay lips of the lively Nellie.</p>
          <p>In this strain I've many times heard them talk, but it always wound
up with a smile at the suggestion of the volatile Miss Nellie.</p>
          <p>When I had been there but two days, I began to suspect Mrs.
<pb id="browne345" n="345"/>
Smith's disposition, for she several times declared her opinion that
niggers had no business with company, and that her's shouldn't have
any. This was a damper to my hopes, for my chief motive for wishing
to be sold in L— was the pleasure I expected to derive from Henry's
society. Every night, as early as eight, the servants were ordered to their
respective quarters, and, as I slept in the house, a stolen interview with
him would have been impossible, as Mrs. Smith was too alert for me to
make an unobserved exit. On the second evening of my sojourn there,
Henry called to see me about half-past seven o'clock; and, just as I was
beginning to yield myself up to pleasure, Mrs. Smith came to the
kitchen, and, seeing him there, asked,</p>
          <p>“Whose negro is this?”</p>
          <p>“Henry Graham is my name, Missis,” was the reply.</p>
          <p>“Well, what business have you here?”</p>
          <p>Henry was embarrassed; he hung his head, and, after a moment,
faltered out,</p>
          <p>“I came to see Ann, Missis.”</p>
          <p>“Where do you belong?”</p>
          <p>“I belong to Mr. Graham, but am hired to the G— House.”</p>
          <p>“Well, then, go right there; and, if ever I catch you in my kitchen
again, I'll send your master word, and have you well flogged. I don't
allow negro men to come to see my servants. I want them to have no
false notions put into their heads. A nigger has no business visiting; let
him stay at home and do his master's work. I shouldn't be surprised if I
missed something out of the kitchen, and if I do, I shall know that you
stole it, and you shall be whipped for it; so shall Ann, for daring to
bring strange niggers into my kitchen. Now, clear yourself, man.”</p>
          <p>With an humbled, mortified air, Henry took his leave. A thousand
scorpions were writhing in my breast. That he, my love, so honest,
noble, honorable, and gentlemanly in all his feelings, should be so
accused almost drove me to madness. I could not bear to have his pride
so bowed and his dearly-cherished
<pb id="browne346" n="346"/>
principles outraged. From that day I entertained no kind feeling for
Mrs. Smith.</p>
          <p>On another occasion, a Saturday afternoon, when Louise came to sit a
few moments with me, she heard of it, and, rushing down stairs, ordered
her to leave on the instant, adding that her great abomination was free
niggers, and she wouldn't have them lurking round her kitchen,
corrupting her servants, and, perhaps, purloining everything within their
reach.</p>
          <p>Louise was naturally of a quick and passionate disposition; and, to be
thus wantonly and harshly treated, was more than she could bear. So
she furiously broke forth, and such a scene as occurred between them
was disgraceful to humanity! Miss Adele hearing the noise instantly
came out, and in a positive tone ordered Louise to leave; which order
was obeyed. After hearing from her mother a correct statement of the
case, Miss Adele burst into tears and went to her room<corr>.</corr> I afterward
heard her kindly remonstrating with her mother upon the injustice of
such a course of conduct toward her servants. But Mrs. Smith was
confirmed in her notions. They had been instilled into her early in life;
had grown with her growth and strengthened with her years. So it was
not possible for her young and philanthropic daughter to remove them.
Once, when Miss Adele was quite sick, and after I had been nursing her
indefatigably for some time, she said to me,</p>
          <p>“Ann, you have told me the story of your love. I have been thinking
of Henry, and pitying his condition, and trying to devise some way for
you to see him.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Miss Adele, you are very kind.”</p>
          <p>“The plan I have resolved upon is this: I will pretend to send you
out of evenings on errands for me; you can have an understanding with
Henry, and meet at some certain point; then take a walk or go to a
friend's; but always be careful to get home before ten o'clock.”</p>
          <p>This was kindness indeed, and I felt the grateful tears gathering in my
eyes! I could not speak, but knelt down beside the bed, and reverently
kissed the hem of her robe. Goodness such
<pb id="browne347" n="347"/>
as hers, charity and love to all, elicited almost my very worship!</p>
          <p>I remember the first evening that I carried this scheme into effect. She
was sitting in a large arm-chair carefully wrapped up in the folds of an
elegant velvet <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">robe-de-chambre</hi></foreign>. Her mother, sister, and cousin were
beside her, all engaged in a cheerful conversation, when she called me to
her, and pretended to give me some errand to attend to out in the city,
telling me <hi rend="italics">pointedly</hi> that it would require my attention until near ten
o'clock. How like a lovely earth-angel appeared she then!</p>
          <p>I had previously apprized Henry of the arrangement, and named a
point of meeting. Upon reaching it, I found him already waiting for me.
We took a long stroll through the lamp-lit streets, talking of the blessed
hopes that struggled in our bosoms; of the faint divinings of the future;
told over the story of past sufferings, and renewed olden vows of
devotion.</p>
          <p>He, with the most lover-like fondness, had brought me some little
gift; for this I kindly reproved him, saying that all his money should be
appropriated to himself, that, by observing a rigid economy, we but
hastened on the glorious day of release from bondage. Before ten I was
at home, and waiting beside Miss Adele. How kindly she asked me if I
had enjoyed myself; and with what pride I told her of the joy that her
kindness had afforded me! Surely the sweet smile that played so
luminously over her fair face was a reflex of the peace that irradiated her
soul! How beautifully she illustrated, in her single life, the holy
ministrations of true womanhood! Did she not, with kind words and
generous acts, “strive to bind up the bruised, broken heart.” At the very mention of her name, aye, at the thought of her even, I never fail to
invoke a blessing upon her life!</p>
          <p>Thus, for weeks and months, through her ingenuity, I saw Henry and
Louise frequently. Otherwise, how dull and dreary would have seemed
to me that long, cold winter, with its heaped snow-banks, its dull, gray
sky, its faint, chill sun, and leafless trees; but the sunbeam of her
kindness made the season bright, warm and grateful!</p>

            <p>THE NEW ASSOCIATES—DEPRAVED VIEWS—ELSY'S
MISTAKE—DEPARTURE OF THE YOUNG LADIES—LONELINESS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>IN Mr. Smith's family of servants was Emily, the cook, a sagacious
woman, but totally without education, knowledge, or the peculiar
ambition that leads to its acquisition. She was a bold, raw, unthinking
spirit; and, from the fact that she had been kept closely confined to the
house, never allowed any social pleasure, she resolved to be revenged,
and unfortunately in her desire for “spite ” (as she termed it), had
sacrificed her character, and was the mother of two children, with
unacknowledged fathers. Possessed of a violent temper, she would, at
periods, rave like a mad-woman; and only the severest lashing could
bring her into subjection. She was my particular terror. Her two
children, half-bloods, were little, sick, weasly things that excited the
compassion of all beholders, and though two years of age (twins), were,
from some physical derangement, unable to walk.</p>
          <p>There was also a man servant, Duke, who attended to odd ends of
housework, and served in the capacity of decorated carriage-driver, and
a girl, Elsy, a raw, green, country concern, good-natured and foolish,
with a face as black as tar. They had hired her from a man in the
country, and she being quite delighted with town and the off-cast finery
of the ladies, was as happy as <hi rend="italics">she</hi> could be—yet the mistakes she
constantly made were truly amusing. She had formed quite an
attachment for Duke, which he did not in the slightest degree return;
yet, with none of the bashfulness of her sex, she confessed to the
feeling, and declared that “Duke was very mean not to love
<pb id="browne349" n="349"/>
her a little.” This never failed to excite the derision of the more
sprightly Emily.</p>
          <p>“Well, you is a fool,” she would exclaim, with an odd shake of the
head.</p>
          <p>“I loves him, and don't kere who knows it.”</p>
          <p>“Does he love you?” asked Emily.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Well</hi>, he doesn't.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">Then I'd hate him,</hi>” replied Emily, as, with a great force, she
brought her rolling-pin down on the table.</p>
          <p>“No, I wouldn't,” answered the loving Elsy.</p>
          <p>“You ain't worth shucks.”</p>
          <p>“Wish I was worth Duke.”</p>
          <p>“Hush, fool.”</p>
          <p>“You needn't git mad, kase I don't think as you does.”</p>
          <p>“I is mad bekase you is a fool.”</p>
          <p>“Who made me one?”</p>
          <p>“You was born it, I guess.”</p>
          <p>“Then I aren't to blame far it. Them that made me is.”</p>
          <p>Conversations like this were of frequent occurrence, and once, when I
ventured to ask Elsy if she wouldn't like to learn to read, she laughed
heartily, saying:</p>
          <p>“Does you think I wants to run off?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly not.”</p>
          <p>“Den why did you ax me if I wanted to larn to read?”</p>
          <p>“So you might have a higher source of enjoyment than you now
have.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, so as to try to git my freedom! You is jist a spy fur de
white folks, and wants to know if I'll run away. Go off, now, and mind
yer own business, kase I has hearn my ole Masser, in de country, say
dat whenever niggers 'gan to read books dey was ob no 'count, and allers
had freedom in dar heads.”</p>
          <p>Finding her thus obstinate, I gave up all attempts to persuade her, and
left her to that mental obscuration in which I found her. Emily
sometimes threatened to apply herself, with vigor, to the gaining of
knowledge, and thus defeat and “spite” her owners; but knowledge so obtained, I think, would be of
<pb id="browne350" n="350"/>
little avail, for, like religion, it must be sought after from higher
motives—sought for itself <hi rend="italics">only</hi>.</p>
          <p>I could find but little companionship with those around me, and lived
more totally within myself than I had ever done. Many times have I
gone to my room, and in silence wept over the isolation in which my
days were spent; but three nights out of the seven were marked with
white stones, for on these I held blissful re-unions with Henry. Our
appointed spot for meeting was near an old pump, painted green, which
was known as the “green pump,” a very favorite one, as the water, pure limestone, was supposed to be better, cooler, and stronger than that of
others. Much has been written, by our popular authors, on the virtues
and legends of old town pumps, but, to me, this one had a beauty, a
charm, a glory which no other inanimate object in wide creation
possessed! And of a moonlight night, when I descried, at a distance, its
friendly handle, outstretched like an arm of welcome, I have rushed up
and grasped it with a right hearty good feeling! Long time afterwards,
when it had ceased to be a love-beacon to me, I never passed it without
taking a drink from its old, rusty ladle, and the water, like the friendly
drauth contained in the magic cup of eastern story, transported me over
the waste of time to poetry and love! Even here I pause to wipe away
the fond, sad tears, which the recollection of that old “green pump”
calls up to my mind, and I should love to go back and stand beside it,
and drink, aye deeply, of its fresh, cool water! There are now many
stately mansions in that growing city, that sits like a fairy queen upon
the shore of the charmed Ohio; but away from all its lofty structures
and edifices of wealth, away from her public haunts, her galleries and
balls, would I turn, to pay homage to the old “green pump”!</p>
          <p>Some quiet evenings, too, had I in Louise's room, listening to Henry
sing, while he played upon his banjo. His voice was fine, full, and
round, and rang out with the clearness of a bell. Though possessed of
but slight cultivation, I considered it the finest one I ever heard.</p>
          <pb id="browne351" n="351"/>
          <p>But again my pleasures were brought to a speedy close. As
the winter began to grow more cold, and the city more dull, the young
ladies began to talk of a jaunt to New Orleans. Their first determination
was to carry me with them; but, after calculating the “cost,” they
concluded it was better to go without a servant, and render all necessary
toilette services to each other. They had no false pride—thanks to their
Northern education for that!</p>
          <p>Before their departure they gave quite a large dinner-party, served up
in the most fantastic manner, consisting of six different courses. I
officiated as waiter, assisted by Duke. Owing to the scarcity of
servants in the family, Elsy was forced to attend the door, and render
what assistance she could at the table.</p>
          <p>Whilst they were engaged on the fourth course, a violent ring was
heard at the door-bell, which Elsy was bound to obey.</p>
          <p>In a few moments she returned, saying to one of the guests:</p>
          <p>“Miss Allfield, a lady wishes to speak with you.”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">With me?</hi>” interrogated the lady.</p>
          <p>“Yes, marm.” </p>
          <p>“Who can she be?” said Miss Allfield, in surprise.</p>
          <p>“Bid the lady be seated in the parlor, and say that Miss
Allfield is at dinner,” replied Mrs. Smith.</p>
          <p>If the company will excuse me, I will attend to this unusual
visitor,” said Miss Allfield, as she rose to leave.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">It is a colored lady</hi>, and she is waitin' fur you at the door,” put in
Elsy.</p>
          <p>The blank amazement that sat upon the face of each guest, may be
better imagined than described! Some of them were ready to go into
convulsions of laughter. A moment of dead silence reigned around, when
Miss Nellie set the example of a hearty laugh, in which all joined, except
Mr. and Mrs. Smith, whose faces were black as a tempest-cloud.</p>
          <p>But there stood the offending Elsy, all unconscious of her guilt.
When she first came to town, she had been in the habit of announcing
company to the ladies as “a man wants to see
<pb id="browne352" n="352"/>
you,” or “a woman is in the parlor,” and had, every time, been severely reprimanded, and told that she should say “a lady or gentleman is in the parlor.” And the poor, green creature, in her great regard for “ears polite,” did not know how to make the distinction between the races; but most certainly was she taught it by the severe whipping that was
administered to her afterwards by Mr. Smith. No intercession or
entreaty from the ladies could be of any avail. Upon Elsy's bare back
must the atonement be made! After this public whipping, she was held
somewhat in disgrace by the other servants. Duke gave her a very
decided cut, and Emily, who had never liked her, was now lavish in her
abuse and ill-treatment. She even struck the poor, offenceless creature
many blows; and from this there was no redemption, for she was in sad
disrepute with Mr. and Mrs. Smith; and, after the young ladies'
departure, she had no friend at all, for I was too powerless to be of use
to her.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>The remainder of the winter was dull indeed. My interviews with
Henry had been discontinued; and I never saw Louise. I had no time for
reading. It was work, work, delve and drudge until my health sank under
it. Mrs. Smith never allowed us any time on Sundays, and the idea of a
negro's going to church was outrageous.</p>
          <p>“No,” she replied, when I asked permission to attend church, “stay at home and do your work. What business have negroes going to
church? They don't understand anything about the sermon.”</p>
          <p>Very true, I thought, for the most of them; but who is to blame for
their ignorance? If opportunities for improvement are not allowed
them, assuredly they should not suffer for it.</p>
          <p>How dead and lifeless lay upon my spirit that dull, cold winter! The
snow-storm was without; and ice was within. Constant fault-finding
and ten thousand different forms of domestic persecution well-nigh
crushed the life out of me. Then there was not one break of beauty in
my over-cast sky! No faint
<pb id="browne353" n="353"/>
or struggling ray of light to illume the ice-bound circle that surrounded
me!</p>
          <p>But the return of spring began to inspire me with hope; for then I
expected the arrival of my unknown mistress. Henry and Louise both
knew her, and they represented her as possessed of very amiable and
philanthropic views. How eagerly I watched for the coming of the May
blossoms, for then she, too, would come, and I be released from torture!
How dull and dreary seemed the howling month of March, and even the
fitful, changeful April. Alternate smiles and tears were wearying to me,
and sure I am, no school-girl elected queen of the virgin month, ever
welcomed its advent with such delight as I!</p>
          <p>With its first day came the young ladies. Right glad was I to see them.
They returned blooming and bright as flowers,
with the same gentle manners and kindly dispositions that they had
carried away.</p>
          <p>Miss Nellie had many funny anecdotes to tell of what she had
seen and heard; really it was delightful to hear her talk in that mirth-provoking
manner! In her accounts of Southern dandyisms and
fopperies, she drew forth her father's freest applause.</p>
          <p>“Why, Nellie, you ought to write a book, you would beat
Dickens,” he used to say; but her more sober sister and cousin never
failed to reprove her, though gently, for her raillery.</p>
          <p>“Well, Elsy,” she cried, when she met that little-respected personage,
“Have any more ‘colored ladies’ called during our absence?” This was done in a kind, jocular way; but the poor negro felt it keenly, and held
her head down in mortification.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>At length the second week of the mouth of May arrived, and with it
came my new mistress! A messenger, no less a person
than Henry, was despatched for me. The time for which I was hired at
Mr. Smith's having expired two weeks previously,
I hastily got myself ready, and Henry once again shouldered my trunk.</p>
          <p>With a feeling of delight, I said farewell to Mrs. Smith and the
servants; but when I bade the young ladies good-bye, I
<pb id="browne354" n="354"/>
own to the weakness of shedding tears! I tried to impress upon Miss
Adele's mind the sentiment of love that I cherished for her, and I had the
satisfaction of knowing that she was not too proud to feel an interest in
me.</p>
          <p>All the way to the G— House, Henry was trying to cheer me up,
and embolden me for the interview with Miss Nancy. I had been
looking anxiously for the time of her arrival, and now I shrank from it. It
was well for my presence of mind that Miss Jane and her husband had
returned to their homestead, for I do not think that I could have
breathed freely in the same house with them, even though their control
over me had ceased.</p>
          <p>Arriving at the G— House, I had not the courage to venture instantly
into Miss Nancy's presence; but sought refuge, for a few moments, in
Louise's apartment, where she gave me a very <hi rend="italics">cordial</hi> reception, and a
delightful beverage compounded of blackberries.</p>

          <p>The tone of that voice re-inspired me, and I boldly entered.</p>
          <p>There, resting upon the bed, was one of the sweetest and most
benign faces that I ever beheld. Age had touched it but to beautify.
Serene and clear, from underneath the broad cap
frill shone her mild gray eyes. The wide brow was calm and white as an
ivory tablet, and the lip, like a faded rose-leaf, hinted
the bright hue which it had worn in health. The cheek, like the lip, was
blanched by the hand of disease. “Ah,” she said, as with a slight cough she elevated herself upon the pillow, “it is you, Ann. You are a little
tardy. I have been looking for you for the last half-hour.”</p>
          <p>“I have been in the house some time, Miss Nancy, but had not the
courage to venture into your presence; and yet I have been watching
for your arrival with the greatest anxiety.”</p>
          <p>“You must not be afraid of me, child, I am but a sorry invalid, who
will, I fear, often weary and overtax your patience; but you must bear
with me; and, if you are faithful, I will reward you for it. Henry has told
me that you are pretty well educated, and have a pleasant voice for
reading. This delights me much; for your principal occupation will be to
read to me.”</p>
          <p>Certainly this pleased me greatly, for I saw at once that I
<pb id="browne356" n="356"/>
was removed from the stultifying influences which had so long been
exercised over my mind. Now I should find literary food to supply my
craving. My eyes fairly sparkled, as I answered,</p>
          <p>“This is what I have long desired, Miss Nancy; and you have
assigned to me the position I most covet.”</p>
          <p>“I am glad I have pleased you, child. It is my pleasure to gratify
others. Our lives are short, at best, and he or she only lives <hi rend="italics">truly</hi> who
does the most good.”</p>
          <p>This was a style and manner of talk that charmed me. Beautiful
example and type of womankind! I felt like doing reverence to her.</p>
          <p>She reached her thin hand out to help herself to a glass of water, that
stood on a stand near by. I sprang forward to relieve her.</p>
          <p>“Ah, thank you,” she said, in a most bland tone; 
“I am very weak; the slightest movement convinces me of the 
failure of my strength.”</p>
          <p>I begged that she would not exert herself, but always call on me for
everything that she needed.</p>
          <p>“I came here to serve you, and I assure you, my dear Miss Nancy, I
shall be most happy in doing it. Mine will, I believe, truly be a ‘labor
of love.’ ”</p>
          <p>Another sweet smile, with the gilded light of a sunbeam,
broke over her calm, sweet face! Bless her! she and all of her
class should be held as “blessed among women;” for do they
not walk with meek and reverent footsteps in the path of her,
the great model and prototype of all the sex?</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>When I had been with her but a few days, she informed me that, as
soon as her health permitted, she intended being removed to her house
on Walnut street. I was not particularly anxious for this; for my sojourn
at the G— house was perfectly delightful<corr>.</corr> My frequent intercourse
with Henry and Louise, was a source of intense pleasure to me. I was
allowed to pass the evenings with them. Truly were those hours dear
and bright. Henry played upon his banjo, and sang to us the most
<pb id="browne357" n="357"/>
enrapturing songs, airs and glees; and Louise generally supplied us with
cakes and lemonade! How exquisite was my happiness, as there we sat
upon the little balcony gazing at the Indiana shore, and talking of the
time when Henry and I should be free.</p>
          <p>“How much remains to be paid to your master, Henry,” asked
Louise.</p>
          <p>“I have paid all but three hundred and fifty; one hundred of which I
already have; so, in point of fact, I lack only two hundred and fifty,”
said Henry.</p>
          <p>“I am very anxious to leave here this fall. I wish to go to Montreal.
Now, if you could make your arrangements to go on with me, I should
be glad. I shall require the services and attentions of a man; and, if you
have not realized the money by that time, I think I can lend it to you,”
returned Louise.</p>
          <p>A bright light shone in Henry's eye, as he returned his thanks; but
quickly the coming shadow banished that radiance of joy.</p>
          <p>“But think of her,” he said tenderly, laying his hand on my
shoulder; “what can she do without us, or what should I be without her?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, think not of me, dearest, I have a good home, and am well cared
for. Go, and as soon as you can, make the money, and come back for
me.”</p>
          <p>“Live years away from you? Oh, no, no!” and he wound his arm
around my waist, and, most naturally, my head rested upon his
shoulder. Loud and heavy was his breathing, and I knew that a fierce
struggle was raging in his breast.</p>
          <p>“I will never leave her, Louise,” he at length replied. “That tyrant,
the law, may part us; but, my free will and act—<hi rend="italics">never.</hi>”</p>
          <p>“Ah, well,” added she, as she looked upon us, “you will
think better of this after you give it a little reflection. This is only love's
delusion;” and, in her own quiet, sensible way, she
turned the stream of conversation into another channel.</p>
          <p>I think now, with pleasure, of the lovely scenes I enjoyed
<pb id="browne358" n="358"/>
on those evenings, with the fire-flies playing in the air; and many times
have I thought how beautifully and truly they typify the illusive
glancings of hope, darting here and there with their fire-lit wings; eluding
our grasp, and sparkling e'en as they flit.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>A few weeks after my installation in the new office, my mistress,
whose health had been improving under my nursing, began to get ready
to move to her sweet little cottage residence on Walnut street. I was not
anxious for the change, notwithstanding it gave me many local
advantages; for I should be removed from Henry, and though I knew
that I could see him often, yet the same roof would not cover us. But
my life, hitherto, had been too dark and oppressed for me to pause and
mourn over the “crumpled rose-leaf;” and so, with right hearty good
will I set to work “packing Miss Nancy's trunk,” and gathering up her
little articles that had lain scattered about the room.</p>
          <p>An upholsterer had been sent out to get the house ready for us.
When we were on the eve of starting, Henry came to carry the luggage,
and Miss Nancy paid him seventy-five cents, at which he took off his
hat, made a low bow, and said,</p>
          <p>“Thank you, Missis.”</p>
          <p>Miss Nancy was seated on the most comfortable cushion, and I
directly opposite, fanning her<corr sic=",">.</corr></p>
          <p>We drove up to the house, a neat little brick cottage, painted white,
with green shutters, and a deep yard in front, thickly swarded, with a
variety of flowers, and a few forest trees. Beautiful exotics, in rare
plaster, and stone vases, stood about in the yard, and a fine cast-iron
watch-dog slept upon the front steps. Passing through the broad hall,
you had a fine view of the grounds beyond, which were handsomely
decorated. The out-buildings were all neatly painted or white-washed.
A thorough air of neatness presided over the place. On the right of the
hall was the parlor, furnished in the very perfection of taste and
simplicity.</p>
          <pb id="browne359" n="359"/>
          <p>The carpet was of blue, bespeckled with yellow; a sofa of blue
brocatelle, chairs, and ottomans of the same material, were scattered
about. A cabinet stood over in the left corner, filled with the collections
and curiosities of many years' gathering, whilst the long blue curtains,
with festoonings of lace, swept to the floor! Adjoining the parlor was the
dining-room, with its oaken walls, and cane-colored floor-cloth.
Opposite to the parlor, and fronting the street, was Miss Nancy's room,
with its French bedstead, lounge, bureau, bookcase, table, and all the
et ceteras of comfort. Opening out from her room was a small apartment,
just large enough to contain a bed, chair, and wardrobe, with a cheap
little mirror overhanging a tasteful dresser, whereon were laid a comb,
brush, soap, basin, pitcher, &amp;c. This room had been prepared for me
by my kind mistress. Pointing it out, she said,</p>
          <p>“That, Ann, is your <hi rend="italics">castle</hi>.” I could not restrain my tears.</p>
          <p>“Heaven send me grace to prove my gratitude to you, kind
Miss Nancy,” I sobbed out.</p>
          <p>“Why, my poor girl, I deserve no thanks for the performance
of my duty. You are a human being, my good, attentive nurse, and I am
bound to consider your comfort or prove unworthy of my avowed
principles.”</p>
          <p>“This is so unlike what I have been used to, Miss Nancy, that it
excites my wonder as well as gratitude.”</p>
          <p>“I fear, poor child, that you have served in a school of rough
experience! You are so thoroughly disciplined, that, at times, you
excite, my keenest pity.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'm, I have had all sorts of trouble. The only marvel is that I
am not utterly brutalized.”</p>
          <p>“Some time you must tell me your history; but not now, my nerves
are too unquiet to listen to an account so harrowing as I know your
recital must be.”</p>
          <p>As I adjusted the pillow and arranged the beautiful silk spread (her
own manufacture), I observed that her eyes were filled with tears. I said
nothing, but the sight of <hi rend="italics">those tears</hi> served to soften many a painful
recollection of former years.</p>
          <pb id="browne360" n="360"/>
          <p>I am conscious, in writing these pages, that there will be few of my
white readers who can enter fully into my feelings. It is impossible for
them to know how deeply the slightest act of kindness impressed <hi rend="italics">me</hi>—
how even a word or tone gently spoken called up all my thankfulness!
Those to whom kindness is common, a mere household article, whose
ears are greeted morning, noon and night, with loving sounds and kind
tones, will deem this strange and exaggerated; but, let them recollect
that I was a <hi rend="italics">slave</hi>—not a mere servant, but a perpetual slave, according to
the abhorred code of Kentucky; and their wonder will cease.</p>
          <p>The first night that I threw myself down on my bed to sleep (did I
state that I had a bedstead—that I had <hi rend="italics">actually</hi> what slaves deemed a
great luxury—a <hi rend="italics">high-post bedstead</hi>?) I felt as proud as a queen.
Henry had been to see me. I entertained him in a nice, clean, carpeted
kitchen, until a few minutes of ten o'clock, when he left me; for at that
hour, by the city ordinance, he was obliged to be at home.</p>
          <p>“What,” I thought, “have I now to desire? Like the weary dove sent
out from the ark, I have at last found land, peace and safety. Here I can
rest contentedly beneath the waving of the olive branches that guard the
sacred portal of <hi rend="italics">home</hi>! <hi rend="italics">Home</hi>! home this truly was! A home where the
heart would always love to lurk; and how blessed seemed the word to
me, now that I comprehended its practical significance! No more was it
a fable, an expression merely used to adorn a song or round a verse!</p>
          <p>That first night that I spent at home was not given up to sleep. No, I was
too happy for that! Through the long, mysterious hours, I lay wakeful
on my soft and pleasant pillow, weaving fairest fancies from the dim
chaos of happy hopes. Adown the sloping vista of the future I descried
nought but shade and flowers!</p>
          <p>With my new mistress, I was more like a companion than a servant.
My duties were light—merely to read to her, nurse her, and do her
sewing; and, as she had very little of the latter,
<pb id="browne361" n="361"/>
I may as well set it down as the “extras” of my business, rather ,than
the business itself.</p>
          <p>I rose every morning, winter and summer, at five o'clock, and arranged
Miss Nancy's room whilst she slept; and, so accustomed had she
become to my light tread, that she slept as soundly as though no one had
been stirring. After this was done, I placed the family Bible upon a stand
beside her bed; then took my sewing and seated myself at the window,
until she awoke. Then I assisted her in making her morning toilette,
which was very simple; wheeled the easy chair near the bed, and helped
her into it. After which she read a chapter from the holy book, followed
by a beautiful, extemporaneous prayer, in which we were joined by
Biddy, the Irish cook. After this, Miss Nancy's breakfast was brought in
on a large silver tray,—a breakfast consisting of black tea, Graham
bread, and mutton chop. In her appetite, as in her character, she was
simple. After this was over, Biddy and I breakfasted in the kitchen. Our
fare was scarcely so plain, for hearty constitutions made us averse to the
abstemiousness of our mistress. We had hot coffee, steaming steaks,
omelettes and warm biscuits.</p>
          <p>“Ah, but she is a love of a lady!” exclaimed Biddy, as she ate away
heartily at these luxuries. “Where in this city would we find such a
mistress, that allows the servants better fare than she takes herself?
And then she never kapes me from church. I can attend the holy mass,
and even go to vespers every Sunday of my life. The Lord have her soul
for it! But she is as good as a canonized saint, if she is a Protestant!”</p>
          <p>Sometimes I used to repeat these conversations to Miss Nancy.
They never failed to amuse her greatly.</p>
          <p>“Poor Biddy,” she would say, in a quiet way, with a sweet smile,
“ought to know that true religion is the same in all. It is not the being a
member of a particular church, or believing certain dogmas of faith, that
make us religious, heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ. It is the
living religion, not the simple believing of it, that constitutes us
<hi rend="italics">Christians</hi>. We must feel that all men are our brothers, and all women
our sisters;
<pb id="browne362" n="362"/>
for in the kingdom of heaven there will be no distinction of race or color,
and I see no reason why we should live differently here. The Saviour of
the world associated with the humblest. His chosen twelve were the
fishermen of Galilee. I want to live in constant preparation for death;
but, alas! my weak endeavor is but seldom crowned with success.”</p>
          <p>How reverently I looked upon her at such times! What a beautiful
saint she was!</p>
          <p>One evening in the leafy month of June, when the intensity of
summer begins to make itself felt, I took my little basket, filled with
some ruffling that I was embroidering for Miss Nancy's wrapper, and
seated myself upon the little portico at the back of the house. I had been
reading to her the greater portion of the day, and felt that it was pleasant
to be left in an indolent, dreamy state of mind, that required no
concentration of thought. As my fingers moved lazily along, I was
humming an old air, that I had heard in far less happy days. Every
thing around me was so pleasant! The setting sun was flinging floods of
glory over the earth, and the young moon was out upon her new wing,
softening and beautifying the scene. Afar off, the lull of pleasant waters
and the music-roar of the falls sounded dreamily in my ear! I laid my
work down in the basket, and, with closed eyes, thought over the events
and incidents of my past life of suffering; and, as the dreary picture of
my troubles at Mr. Peterkin's returned to my mind, and my subsequent
imprisonment in the city, my trials at “the pen,” and then this my safe
harbor and haven of rest, so strange the whole seemed, that I almost
doubted the reality, and feared to open my eyes, lest the kindly, illusive
dream should be broken forever. But no, it was no dream; for, upon
turning my head, I spied through the unclosed door of the dining-room
the careful arrangement of the tea-table. There it stood, with its snowy
cover, upon which were placed the fresh loaf of Graham bread, the roll
of sweet butter, some parings of cheese, the glass bowl of fruit and
pitcher of cream, together with the friendly tea-urn of bright silver, from
which I, even <hi rend="italics">I</hi>, had often been supplied with the
<pb id="browne363" n="363"/>
delightful beverage. And then, stepping through the door, with a calm
smile on her face, was Miss Nancy herself! How beautifully she looked
in her white, dimity wrapper, with the pretty blue girdle, and tiny lace,
cap! She gazed out upon the yard, with the blooming roses, French
pinks, and Colombines that grew in luxuriance. Stepping upon the
sward, she gathered a handful of flowers, clipping them nicely from the
bush with a pair of scissors, that she wore suspended by a chain to her
side. Seeing me on the portico, she said,</p>
          <p>“Ann, bring me my basket and thread here, and wheel my arm-chair
out; I wish to sit with you here.”</p>
          <p>I obeyed her with pleasure, for I always liked to have her near me.
She was so much more the friend than the mistress, that I never felt any
reserve in her presence. All was love. As she took her seat in the arm-chair,
I threw a shawl over her shoulders to protect her from any
injurious influence of the evening air. She busied herself tying up the
flowers; and their arrangement of color, &amp;c., with a view to effect,
would have done credit to a florist. My admiration was so much excited,
that I could not deny myself the pleasure of an expression of it.</p>
          <p>“Ah, yes,” she answered, “this was one of the amusements of my youth. Many a bouquet have I tied up in my dear old home.”</p>
          <p>I thought I detected a change in her color, and heard a sigh, as she
said this.</p>
          <p>“Of what State are you a native, Miss Nancy?“</p>
          <p>“Dear old Massachusetts,” she answered, with a glow of
enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>“It is the State, of all others in the Union, for which I have the most
respect.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, well may you say that, poor girl,” she replied, “for its people treat your unfortunate race with more humanity than any of the
others.”</p>
          <p>“I have read a great deal of their liberality and cultivation, of both
mind and heart, which has excited my admiring interest. Then, too, I
have known those born and reared beneath the
<pb id="browne364" n="364"/>
shadow of its wise and beneficent laws, and the better I knew them, the
more did my admiration for the State increase. Now I feel that
Massachusetts is doubly dear to me, since I have learned that it is your
birth-place.”</p>
          <p>She did not say anything, but her mild eyes were suffused
with tears.</p>
          <p>Just as I was about to speak to her of Mr. Trueman, Biddy
came to announce tea, and, after that, Miss Nancy desired to be
left alone. As was his custom, with eight o'clock cam Henry.
We sat on the portico, with the moonlight shining over us, and talked of the future! I told him what Miss Nancy said of Massachusetts, and, I believe, he
was seized with the idea of going thither after purchasing himself.</p>
          <p>He was unusually cheerful. He had made a great deal in the last few
months; had grown to be quite a favorite with the keeper of the hotel,
and was liberally paid for his Sunday and holiday labors, and, by
errands for, and donations from, the boarders, had contrived to lay up a
considerable sum.</p>
          <p>“I hope, dearest, to be able soon to accomplish my freedom; then I
shall be ready to buy you. How much does Miss Nancy ask for you?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Henry, I cannot leave her, even if I were able to pay down
every cent that she demands for me. I should dislike to go away from
her. She is so kind and good; has been such a friend to we that I could
not desert her. Who would nurse her? Who would feel the same interest
in her that I do? No, I will stay with her as long as she lives, and do all I
can to prove my gratitude.”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean, Ann? Would you refuse to make me happy?
Miss Nancy has other friends who would wait upon her.”</p>
          <p>“But, Henry, that does not release me from my obligation. When she
was on the eve of starting upon a journey, you went to her with the
story of my danger. She promptly consented to buy me without even
seeing me. I was not purchased as an article of property; with the
noble liberality of a philanthropist,
<pb id="browne365" n="365"/>
she ransomed, at a heavy price, a suffering sister, and shall I be such an
ingrate as to leave her? No, she and Mr. Trueman of Boston, are the two
beings whom I would willingly serve forever.”</p>
          <p>Just then a deep sigh burst from the full heart of some one, and I
thought I heard a retreating footstep.</p>
          <p>“Who can that have been?” asked Henry.</p>
          <p>We examined the hall, the dining-room, my apartment; and I knocked
at Miss Nancy's door, but, receiving no answer, I judged she was
asleep.</p>
          <p>“It was but one of those peculiar voices of the night, which are the
better heard from this intense silence,” said Henry, and, finding that my
alarm was quieted, he bade me an affectionate good-night, and so we
parted.</p>

            <p>AN AWFUL REVELATION—MORE CLOUDS TO DARKEN THE
SUN OF LIFE—SICKNESS AND BLESSED INSENSIBILITY.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I SLEPT uninterruptedly that night, and, on awaking in the morning, I
was surprised to find it ten minutes past five. Hurrying on my clothes,
I went to Miss Nancy's apartment, and was much surprised to find her
sitting in her easy chair, her toilette made. Looking up from the Bible,
which lay open on the stand before her, she said,</p>
          <p>“I have stolen a march, Ann, and have risen before you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'm,” replied I, in a mortified tone, “I am ten minutes behind the time; I am very sorry, and hope you will excuse me.”</p>
          <p>“No apologies, now; I hope you do not take me for a cruel, exacting
task-mistress, who requires every inch of your time.”</p>
          <p>“No, indeed, I do not, for I know you to be the kindest mistress and
best friend in the world.”</p>
          <p>“And now, Ann, I will read some from the Lamentations of Jeremiah;
and we will unite in family prayer.”</p>
          <p>At the ringing of the little bell Biddy quickly appeared, and we seated
ourselves near Miss Nancy, and listened to her beautiful voice as it
broke forth in the plaintive eloquence of the holy prophet!</p>
          <p>“Let us pray,” she said, fervently, extending her thin, white hands
upward, and we all sank upon our knees. She prayed for grace to rest on
the household; for its extension over the world; that it might visit the
dark land of the South; that the blood of Christ might soften the hearts
of slave-holders. She asked, in a special manner, for power to carry out
her good intentions; prayed that the blessing of God might be given to
me, in a particular manner, to enable me to meet the trials of life, and
invoked benedictions upon Biddy.</p>
          <pb id="browne367" n="367"/>
          <p>When we rose, both Biddy and I were weeping; and as we left her,
Biddy broke forth in all her Irish enthusiasm, “The Lord love her heart!
but she is sanctified! I never heard a prettier <hi rend="italics">prayer said in the Cathedral!</hi>”</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>Miss Nancy's health improved a great deal. She began to walk of
evenings through the yard, and a little in the city. I always attended her.
Of mornings we rode in a carriage that she hired for the occasion, and of
evenings Henry came, and always brought with him his banjo.</p>
          <p>One evening he and Louise came round to sit with me, and after we
had been out upon the portico listening to Henry's songs, Miss Nancy
bade me go to the sideboard and get some cake and wine. Placing it on
the table in the dining-room, I invited them, in Miss Nancy's name, to
come in and partake of it. After proposing the health of my kind
Mistress, to which we all drank, Biddy joining in, Louise pledged a glass
to the speedy ransom of Henry. Just then Miss Nancy entered, saying:</p>
          <p>“My good Henry, when you buy yourself, and find a home in the
North, write us word where you have established yourself, and I will
immediately make out Ann's free papers, and remove thither; but I
cannot think of losing my good nurse. So, for her's, your's and my own
convenience, I will take up my residence wherever you may settle. Stop
now, Ann, no thanks; I know all about your gratitude, for I was a
pleased, though unintentional listener to a conversation between
yourself and Henry, in which I found out how deep is your attachment
to me.”</p>
          <p>Hers, then, was the sigh which had so alarmed me! It was all
explained. I had no words to express my overflowing heart. My whole
soul seemed melted. Henry's eyes were filled with
grateful tears. He sank upon his knees and kissed the hem of Miss
Nancy's dress.</p>
          <p>“No, no, my brave-hearted man, do not kneel to me. I am but the
humble instrument under Heaven; and, oh, how often
<pb id="browne368" n="368"/>
have I prayed for such an opportunity as this to do good, and dispense
happiness.”</p>
          <p>And so saying she glided out of the room.</p>
          <p>“Well,” exclaimed Biddy, “she is more than a saint, she is an angel,”
and she wiped the tears from her honest eyes.</p>
          <p>“I have known her for some time,” said Louise; “and never saw her do, or heard of her doing a wrong action. She is very different from her
brother. Does he come here often, Ann?”</p>
          <p>“Not often; about once a fortnight.”</p>
          <p>“He is too much taken up with business; hasn't a thought outside of
his counting-room. He doesn't share in any of her philanthropic ideas.”</p>
          <p>“She hasn't her equal on earth,” added Henry. “Mr. Moodwell is a good man, though not good enough to be <hi rend="italics">her</hi> brother.”</p>
          <p>Thus passed away the evening, until the near approach of ten o'clock
warned them to leave.</p>
          <p>I was too happy for sleep. Many a wakeful night had I passed from
unhappiness, but now I was sleepless from joy.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>The next morning, after Miss Nancy had breakfasted, I asked her
what I should read to her.</p>
          <p>“Nothing this morning, Ann. I had rather you would talk with me.
Let us arrange for the future; but first tell me how much money does
Henry lack to buy himself?”</p>
          <p>“About one hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“I think I can help him to make that up.”</p>
          <p>“You have already done enough, dear Miss Nancy. We could not
ask more of you.”</p>
          <p>“No, but I am anxious to do all I can for you, my good girl. You are
losing the greenest part of your lives. I feel that it is wrong for you to
remain thus.”</p>
          <p>Seeing that I was in an unusually calm mood, she asked me to tell her
the story of my life, or at least the main incidents. I entered upon the
narrative with the same fidelity that I have observed in writing these
memoirs. At many points and scenes I observed her weeping bitterly.
Fearing that the excitement
<pb id="browne369" n="369"/>
might prove too great for her strength, I several times urged her to let me
stop; but she begged me to go on without heeding her, for she was
deeply interested.</p>
          <p>When I came to the account of my meeting with Mr. Trueman,
she bent eagerly forward, and asked if it was Justinian Trueman, of
Boston. Upon my answering in the affirmative, she exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“How like him!” The same noble, generous, disinterested
spirit!”</p>
          <p>“Do you know him, Miss Nancy?”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, child, he is one of our prominent Northern men, a
very able lawyer; every one in the State of Massachusetts knows him
by reputation, but I have a personal acquaintance
also.”</p>
          <p>Just as I was about to ask her something of Mr. Trueman's history,
Biddy came running in, exclaiming:</p>
          <p>“Oh, dear me! Miss Nancy! what do you think? They say that
Mr. Barkoff, the green grocer, has let his wife whip a
colored woman to death.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, it can't be true”, cried Miss Nancy, as she started up from her
chair. “It is, I trust, some slanderous piece of gossip.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, the Lord love your saintly heart, but I do believe 'tis
true, for, as I went down the street to market, I heard some awful
screaming in there, and I asked a girl, standing on the pavement, what it
meant; and she said Mrs. Barkoff was whipping a colored woman; then,
when I came back there was a crowd of children and colored people
round the back gate, and one of them told me the woman was dead,
and that she died shouting.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, God, how fearful is this!” exclaimed Miss Nancy, as the big
tears rolled down her pale cheeks. “Give me, oh, sweet Jesus, the
power to pray as Thou didst, to the Eternal Father, ‘to forgive them, for
they know not what they do!’ ”</p>
          <p>“Come, Ann,” continued the impetuous Biddy, “you go with
<pb id="browne370" n="370"/>
me, and we'll try to find out all about it. We will go to see the woman.”</p>
          <p>“I cannot leave Miss Nancy.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, go with her, Ann; but don't allow her to say anything
imprudent. Poor Biddy has such a good, philanthropic heart, that she
forgets the patient spirit which Christianity inculcates.”</p>
          <p>With a strange kind of awe, I followed Biddy through the streets,
scarcely heeding her impassioned garrulity. The blood seemed freezing
in my veins, and my teeth chattered as though it had been the depth of
winter. As we drew near the place, I knew the house by the crowd that
had gathered around the back and side gates.</p>
          <p>“Let us enter here,” said Biddy, as she placed her hand upon the
heavy plank gate at the back of the lot.</p>
          <p>“Stop, Biddy, stop,” I gasped out, as I held on to the gate for
support, “I feel that I shall suffocate. Give me one moment to get my
breath.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, you are only frightened,” and she led me into the yard,
where we found about a dozen persons, mostly colored.</p>
          <p>“Where is the woman that's been kilt?” inquired Biddy, of a mulatto
girl.</p>
          <p>“She ain't quite dead. Pity she isn't out of her misery, poor soul,”
said the mulatto girl.</p>
          <p>“But where is she?” demanded Biddy.</p>
          <p>“Oh, in thar, the first room in the basement,” and, half-led by Biddy,
I passed in through a mean, damp, musty basement. The noxious
atmosphere almost stifled us. Turning to the left as directed, we entered
a low, comfortless room, with brick walls and floor. Upon a pile of
straw, in this wretched place, lay a bleeding, torn, mangled body, with
scarcely life in it. Two colored women were bathing the wounds and
wrapping greased cloths round the body. I listened to her pitiful groans,
until I thought my forbearance would fail me.</p>
          <p>“Poor soul!” said one of the colored women, “she has had
<pb id="browne371" n="371"/>
a mighty bad convulsion. I wish she could die and be sot free from
misery.”</p>
          <p>“Whar is de white folks?” asked another.</p>
          <p>“Oh, dey is skeered, an' done run off an' hid up stairs.”</p>
          <p>“Who done it?”</p>
          <p>“Why, Miss Barkoff; she put Aunt Kaisy to clean de harth, an' you
see, de poor ole critter had a broken arm. De white folks broke it once
when dey was beatin' of her, and so she couldn't work fast. Well den,
too, she'd been right sick for long time. You see she was right sickly like,
an' when Miss Barkoff come back—she'd only bin gone a little
while—an' see'd dat de harth wasn't done, she fell to beatin' of do poor
ole sick critter, an' den bekase she cried an' hollered, she tuck her into
de coal-house, gagged her mouth, tied her hands an' feet, an' fell to
beatin' of her, an' she beat her till she got tired, den ole Barkoff beat her
till he got satisfied. Den some colored person seed him, an' tole him dat
he better stop, for Aunt Kaisy was most gone.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, 'twas me,” said the other woman, “I was passin' 'long at de back of de lot, an' I hearn a mighty quare noise, so I jist looked through
the crack, an' there I seed him a beatin' of her, an' I hollered to him to
stop, for de Lor sake, or she would die right dar. Den he got skeered an'
run off in de house.”</p>
          <p>The narration was here interrupted by a fearful groan from the
sufferer. One of the women very gently turned her over, with her face
full toward me.</p>
          <p>Oh, God have mercy on me! In those worn, bruised, anguish-marked
features, in the glance of that failing, filmy eye, I recognized my long-lost
mother! With one loud shriek I fell down beside her! After years of
bitter separation, thus to meet! Oh that the recollection had faded from
my mind, but no, that awful sight is ever before my eyes! I see her, even
now, as there she lay bleeding to death! Oh that I had been spared the
knowledge of it!</p>
          <p>There was the same mark upon the brow, and, I suppose,
<pb id="browne372" n="372"/>
more by that than the remembered features, was I enabled to indentify
her.</p>
          <p>My frantic screams soon drew a crowd of persons to the room.</p>
          <p>My mother, my dear, suffering mother, unclosed her eyes, and, by
that peculiar mesmerism belonging to all mothers, she knew it was her
child whose arms were around her.</p>
          <p>“Ann, is it you?” she asked feebly.</p>
          <p>“Yes, mother, it is I; but, oh, how do I find you!”</p>
          <p>“Never mind me, child, I feel that I shall soon be at peace!
'Tis for you that I am anxious. Have you a good home?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; oh, that you had had such!”</p>
          <p>“Thank God for that. You are a woman now, I think; but I am
growing blind, or it is getting dark so fast that I cannot see you. Here,
here, hold me Ann, child, hold me close to you, I am going through the
floor, sinking, sinking down. Catch me, catch me, hold me! It is dark; I
can't see you, where, where are you?”</p>
          <p>“Here, mother, here, I am close to you.”</p>
          <p>“Where, child, I can't see you; here catch me;” and, suddenly
springing up as if to grasp something, she fell back upon the
 straw—<hi rend="italics">a
corpse!</hi></p>
          <p>After such a separation, this was our meeting—and parting! I had
hoped that life's bitterest drop had been tasted, but this was as “vinegar
upon nitre.”</p>
          <p>When I became conscious that the last spark of life was extinct in
that beloved body, I gave myself up to the most delirious grief. As I
looked upon that horrid, ghastly, mangled form, and thought it was my
mother, who had been butchered by the whites, my very blood was
turned to gall, and in this chaos of mind I lost the faculty of reason.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>When my consciousness returned I was lying on a bed in my room,
the blinds of which were closed, and Miss Nancy was seated beside
me, rubbing my hands with camphor. As I opened my eyes, they met
her kind glance fixed earnestly upon me,</p>
          <pb id="browne373" n="373"/>
          <p>“You are better, Ann,” she said, in a low, gentle voice. I was too
languid to reply; but closed my eyes again, with a faint smile. When I
once more opened them I was alone, and through one shutter that had
blown open, a bright ray of sunlight stole, and revealed to me the care
and taste with which my room had been arranged. Fresh flowers in neat
little vases adorned the mantel; and the cage, containing Miss Nancy's
favorite canary, had been removed to my room. The music of this
delightful songster broke gratefully upon my slowly awakening
faculties. I rose from the bed, and seated myself in the large arm-chair.
Passing my hand across my eyes, attempted to recall the painful incidents
of the last few days; and as that wretched death-bed rose upon my memory,
the scalding tears rushed to my eyes, and I wept long, long, as though my
head were turned to waters!</p>
          <p>Miss Nancy entered, and finding me in tears she said nothing; but
turned and left the room. Shortly after, Biddy appeared with some
nourishment,</p>
          <p>“Laws, Ann, but you have been dreadfully sick. You had fever, and
talked out of your head. Henry was here every evening. He said that
once afore, when you took the fevers, you was out of your head, just
the same way. He brought you flowers; there they are in the vase,” and
she handed me two beautiful bouquets.</p>
          <p>In this pleasant way she talked on until I had satisfied the cravings
of an empty stomach with the niceties she had brought me.</p>
          <p>That evening Henry came, and remained with me about half an hour.
Miss Nancy warned him that it was not well to excite me much. So
with considerable reluctance he shortened his visit.</p>

            <p>GRADUAL RETURN OF HAPPY SPIRITS—BRIGHTER
PROSPECTS—AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>WHEN I began to gain strength Miss Nancy took me out in a carriage
of evenings; and had it not been for the melancholy recollections that hung
like a pall around my heart, life would have been beautiful to me. As we
drove slowly through the brightly-lighted streets, and looked at the gaudy
and flaunting windows, where the gayest and most elegant articles of
merchandise were exhibited, I remarked to Miss Nancy, with a sigh, “Life
might be made a very gay and cheerful thing—almost a pleasure, were
it not for the wickedness of men.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, yes, it might, indeed,” she replied, and the big tears rested upon
her eyelids.</p>
          <p>One evening when we had returned from a drive, I noticed that she
ate very little supper, and her hand trembled violently.</p>
          <p>“You are sick, Miss Nancy,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Ann, I feel strangely,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“To-morrow you must go for my brother, and I will have a lawyer
to draw up my will. It would be dreadful if I were to die suddenly
without making a provision for you; then the bonds of slavery would
be riveted upon you, for by law you would pass into my brother's
possession.”</p>
          <p>“Don't trouble yourself about it now, dear Miss Nancy,” I said; “your life is more precious than my liberty.”</p>
          <p>“Not so, my good girl. The dawn of your life was dark, I hope that
the close may be bright. The beginning of mine
<pb id="browne375" n="375"/>
was full of flowers; the close will be serene, I trust; but ah, I've
outlived many a blessed hope that was a very rainbow in my dreaming
years.”</p>
          <p>I had always thought Miss Nancy's early life had been filled with
trouble; else why and whence her strange, subdued, melancholy nature!
How much I would have given had she told me her history; yet I would
not add to her sadness by asking her to tell me of it.</p>
          <p>The next morning I went for Mr. Moodwell, who, at Miss Nancy's
instance, summoned a notary. The will was drawn up and witnessed by
two competent persons.</p>
          <p>After this she began to improve rapidly. Her strength of body and
cheerfulness returned. About this time my peace of mind began to be
restored. Of my poor mother I never spoke, after bearing the particulars
that followed her death. She was hurriedly buried, without psalm or
sermon. No notice was taken by the citizens of her murder—why
should there be? She was but a poor slave, grown old and gray in the
service of the white man; and if her master chose to whip her to death,
who had a right to gainsay him? She was his property to have and to
hold; to use or to kill, as he thought best!</p>
          <p>Give us no more Fourth of July celebrations; the rather let us have a
Venetian oligarchy!</p>
          <p>Miss Nancy, in her kind, persuasive manner, soon lured my thoughts
away from such gloomy contemplations. She sought to point out the
pleasant, easy pathway of wisdom and religion, and I thank her now for
the good lessons she then taught me! Beneath such influence I
gradually grew reconciled to my troubles. Miss Nancy fervently prayed
that they might be sanctified to my eternal good; and so may they!</p>
          <p>Louise came often to see me, and I found her then as now, the
kindest and most willing friend; everything that she could do to please
me she did. She brought me many gifts of books, flowers, fruits, &amp;c. I
may have been petulant and selfish in my grief; but those generous
friends bore patiently with me.</p>
          <p>Pleasant walks I used to take with Henry of evenings, and
<pb id="browne376" n="376"/>
he was then so full of hope, for he had almost realized the sum of
money, that his master required of him.</p>
          <p>“Master will be down early in September,” he said, as we strolled along one evening in August, “and I think by borrowing a little from Miss Nancy, I shall be able to pay down all that I owe him, and then, dearest, I shall be
free—free! only think of it! Of <hi rend="italics">me</hi> being a free man, master of <hi rend="italics">myself</hi>! and
when we go to the North we will be married, and both of us will live with
Miss Nancy, and guard her declining days.”</p>
          <p>Happy tears were shining in his bright eyes, like dew-pearls; but,
with a strong, manly hand he dashed them away, and I clung the fonder
to that arm, that I hoped would soon be able to protect me.</p>
          <p>“There is one foolish little matter, dearest, that I will mention, more
to excite your merriment, than fear,” said Henry with an odd smile.</p>
          <p>“What is it?”</p>
          <p>“Well, promise me not to care about it; only let it give you a good
laugh.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I promise.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” and he paused for a moment, “there is a girl living near the G—
House. She belongs to Mr. Bodley, and has taken a foolish fancy to
me; has actually made advances, even more than advances, actual offers
of love! She says she used to know you, and, on one occasion,
attempted to speak discreditably of you; though I quickly gave her to
understand that I would not listen to it. Why do you tremble so, Ann?”</p>
          <p>And truly I trembled so violently, that if it had not been for the
support that his arm afforded me, I should have fallen to the ground.</p>
          <p>“What is her name?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Melinda, and says she once belonged to Mr. Peterkin.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, she did. We used to call her Lindy.”</p>
          <p>I then told him what an evil spirit she had been in my path; and
ventured to utter a suspicion that her work of harm was yet
unfinished, that she meant me further injury.</p>
          <pb id="browne377" n="377"/>
          <p>“I know her now, dearest. You have unmasked her, and, with me,
she can have no possible power.”</p>
          <p>I seemed to be satisfied, though in reality I was not, for apprehension
of an indefinable something troubled me sorely. The next day Miss
Nancy observed my troubled abstraction, and inquired the cause, with
so much earnestness, that I could not withhold my confidence, and gave
her a full account.</p>
          <p>“And you think she will do you an injury?”</p>
          <p>“I fear so.”</p>
          <p>“But have you not forestalled that by telling Henry who she is, and
how she has acted toward you?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, ma'm, and have been assured by him that she can do me no
harm; but the dread remains.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, you are in a weak, nervous state; I am astonished at Henry for
telling you such a thing at this time.”</p>
          <p>“He thought, ma'm, that it would amuse me, as a fine joke; and so I
supposed I should have enjoyed it.”</p>
          <p>She did all she could to divert my thoughts, made Henry bring his
banjo, and play for me of evenings; bought pleasant romances for me to
read; ordered a carriage for a daily ride; purchased me many pretty
articles of apparel; but, most of all, I appreciated her kind and cheerful
talk, in which she strove to beguile me from everything gloomy or sad.</p>
          <p>Once she sent me down to spend the day with Louise at the G—
House. There was quite a crowd at the hotel. Southerners, who had
come up to pass their summer at the wateringplaces in Kentucky, had
stopped here, and, finding comfortable lodgment, preferred it to the
springs; then there were many others travelling to the North and East <hi rend="italics">via</hi>
L—, who were stopping there. This increased Henry's duties, so that I
saw him but seldom during the day. Once or twice he came to Louise's
room, and told me that he was unusually busy; but that he had earned
four dollars that day, from different persons, in small change, and that he
would be able to make his final payment the next month.</p>
          <p>All this was very encouraging, and I was in unusually fine
<pb id="browne378" n="378"/>
spirits. As Louise and I sat talking in the afternoon, she remarked—</p>
          <p>“Well, Ann, early next month Henry will make his last payment;
and we have concluded to go North the latter part of the same month.
When will Miss Nancy be ready to go?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, she can make her arrangements to start at the same time. I will
speak to her about it this evening.”</p>
          <p>And then, as we sat planning about a point of location, a shadow
darkened the door. I looked up—and, after a long separation, despite
both natural and artificial changes, I recognized <hi rend="italics">Lindy</hi>! I let my sewing fall
from my hands and gazed upon her with as much horror as if she had
been an apparition! Louise spoke kindly to her, and asked her to walk
in.</p>
          <p>“Why, how d'ye do, Ann? I hearn you was livin' in de city, and
intended to come an' see you.”</p>
          <p>I stammered out something, and she seated herself near me, and began
to revive old recollections.</p>
          <p>“They are not pleasant, Lindy, and I would rather they should be
forgotten.”</p>
          <p>“Laws, I's got a very good home now; but I 'tends to marry some
man that will buy me, and set me free! Now, I's got my eye sot on
Henry.”</p>
          <p>I trembled violently, but did not trust myself to speak Louise,
however, in a quick tone, replied:</p>
          <p>“He is engaged, and soon to be married to Ann.”</p>
          <p>“Laws! I doesn't b'lieve it; Ann shan't take him from me.”</p>
          <p>Though this was said playfully, it was easy for me to detect, beneath
the seeming levity, a strong determination, on her part, to do her very
<hi rend="italics">worst</hi>. No wonder that I trembled before her, when I remembered how
powerful an enemy she had been in former times.</p>
          <p>With a few other remarks she left, and Louise observed:</p>
          <p>“That Lindy is a queer girl. With all her ignorance and ugliness, she
excites my dread when I am in her presence—a dread of a supposed
and envenomed power, such as the black cat possesses.”</p>
          <pb id="browne379" n="379"/>
          <p>“Such has ever been the feeling, Louise, that she has excited
in me. She has done me harm heretofore; and do you know, I think she
means me ill now. I have uttered this suspicion
to Henry and Miss Nancy, but they both laughed it to scorn—saying
<hi rend="italics">she</hi> was powerless to injure <hi rend="italics">me</hi>; but still my fear remains, and, when I think
of her, I grow sick at heart.”</p>
          <p>Upon my return home that evening I told Miss Nancy of meeting
with Lindy, and of the conversation, but she attached
no importance to it.</p>
          <p>No one living beneath the vine and fig-tree of Miss Nancy's planting,
and sharing the calm blessedness of her smiles, could be long unhappy!
Her life, as well as words, was a proof that human nature is not all
depraved. In thinking over the rare combination of virtues that her
character set forth, I have marvelled what must have been her childhood.
Certainly she could never have possessed the usual waywardness of children.
Her youth must have been an exception to the general rule. I cannot conceive
her with the pettishness and proneness to quarrel, which we naturally expect in
children. I love to think of her as a quiet little Miss, discarding the doll and
play-house turning quietly away from the frolicsome kitten—seeking the
leafy shade of the New England forests—peering with a curious, thoughtful
eye into the woodland dingle—or straining her gaze far up into the blue
arch of heaven—or questioning, with a child's idle speculation, the whence
and the whither of the mysterious wind. 'Tis thus I have pictured her childhood!
She was a strange, gifted, unusual woman:— who, then, can suppose
that her infancy and youth were ordinary?</p>
          <p>To this day her memory is gratefully cherished by hundreds.
Many a little pauper children have felt the kindness of her charity; and those
who are now independent remember the time when her bounty rescued
them from want, and “they rise up to call her blessed!”</p>
          <p>Often have I gone with her upon visits and errands of charity.
Through many a dirty alley have those dainty feet threaded a
dangerous way; and up many a dizzy, dismal flight of ricketty
<pb id="browne380" n="380"/>
steps have I seen them ascend, and never heard a petulant word, or saw
a haughty look upon her face! She never went upon missions of charity
in a carriage, or, if she was too weak to walk all the way, she discharged
the vehicle before she got in sight of the hovel. “Let us not be
ostentatious,” she would say, when I interposed an objection to her
taking so long a walk. “Besides,” she added, “let us give no offence to these suffering poor ones. Let them think we come as sisters to relieve
them; not as Dives, flinging to Lazarus the crumbs of our bounty!”</p>
          <p>Beautiful Christian soul! baptized with the fire of the Holy Ghost,
endowed with the same saintly spirit that rendered lovely the life of her
whom the Saviour called Mother! thou art with the Blessed now!
After a life of earnest, godly piety, thou hast gone to receive thine
inheritance above, and wear the Amaranthine Crown! for thou didst
obey the Saviour's sternest mandate—sold thy possessions, and gave all
to the poor!</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XL.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>THE CRISIS OF EXISTENCE—A DREADFUL PAGE IN LIFE.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I HAVE paused much before writing this chapter. I have taken up my
pen and laid it down an hundred times, with the task unfulfilled—the duty
unaccomplished. A nervous sensation, a chill
of the heart, have restrained my pen—yet the record must be made.</p>
          <p>I have that to tell, from which both body and soul shrink. Upon me a
fearful office has been laid! I would that others, with colder blood and
less personal interest, could make this disclosure; but it belongs to my
history; nay, is the very nucleus from which all my reflections upon the
institution of slavery have sprung. Reader, did you ever have a wound—a
deep, almost a mortal wound—whereby your life was threatened,
which, after years of nursing and skilful surgical treatment, had
healed, and was then again rudely torn open? This is my situation. I am
going to tear open, with a rude hand, a deep wound, that time and kind
friends have not availed to cure. But like little, timid children, hurrying
through a dark passage, fearing to look behind them, I shall hasten rapidly
over this part of my life, never pausing to comment upon the terrible facts
I am recording. “I have placed my hand to the ploughshare, and will not
turn back.”</p>
          <p>Let me recall that fair and soft evening, in the early September, when
Henry and I, with hand clasped in hand, sat together upon the little
balcony. How sweet-scented was the gale that fanned our brows! The air
was soft and balmy, and
<pb id="browne382" n="382"/>
the sweet serenity of the hour was broken only by that ever-pleasant
music of the gently-roaring falls! Fair and queenly sailed the uprisen
moon, through a cloudless sea of blue, whilst a few faint stars, like
fire-flies, seemed flitting round her.</p>
          <p>Long we talked of the happiness that awaited us on the morrow.
Henry had arranged to meet his master, Mr. Graham, on that day, and
make the final payment.</p>
          <p>“Dearest, I lack but fifty dollars of the amount,” he said, as he laid
his head confidingly on my shoulder.</p>
          <p>“Ten of which I can give you.”</p>
          <p>“And the remaining forty I will make up,” said Miss Nancy as she
stepped out of the door, and, placing a pocket-book in Henry's hand,
she added, “there is the amount, take it and be happy.”</p>
          <p>Whilst he was returning thanks, I went to get my contribution.
Drawing from my trunk the identical ten-dollar note that good Mr.
Trueman had given me, I hastened to present it to Henry, and make out
the sum that was to give us both so much joy.</p>
          <p>“Here, Henry,” I exclaimed, as I rejoined them, “are ten dollars,
which kind Mr. Trueman gave me.”</p>
          <p>Miss Nancy sighed deeply. I turned around, but she said with a
smile:</p>
          <p>“How different is your life now from what it was when that money
was given you.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, indeed,” I answered; “and, thanks, my noble benefactress, to you for it.”</p>
          <p>“Let me,” she continued, without noticing my remark, “see that
note.”</p>
          <p>I immediately handed it to her. Could I be mistaken? No she actually
pressed it to her lips! But then she was such a philanthropist, and she
loved the note because it was the means of bringing us happiness. She
handed it back to me with another sigh. </p>
          <p>“When he gave it to me, he bade me receive it as his contribution
toward the savings I was about to lay up for the
<pb id="browne383" n="383"/>
purchase of myself. Now what joy it gives me to hand it to you, Henry.”
He was weeping, and could not trust his voice to answer.</p>
          <p>“And Ann shall soon be free. Next week we will all start for the
North, and then, my good friends, your white days will commence,”
said Miss Nancy.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Heaven bless you, dear saint,” cried Henry, whose utterance
was choked by tears. Miss Nancy and I both wept heartily; but mine
were happy tears, grateful as the fragrant April showers!</p>
          <p>“Why this is equal to a camp-meeting,” exclaimed Louise, who had,
unperceived by us, entered the front-door, passed through the hall, and
now joined us upon the portico.</p>
          <p>Upon hearing of Henry's good fortune, she began to weep also.</p>
          <p>“Will you not let me make one of the party for the North?” she
inquired of Miss Nancy.</p>
          <p>“Certainly, we shall be glad to have you, Louise; but come, Henry,
get your banjo, and play us a pleasant tune.”</p>
          <p>He obeyed with alacrity, and I never heard his voice sound so rich,
clear and ringing. How magnificent he looked, with the full radiance of
the moonlight streaming over his face and form! His long flossy black
hair was thrown gracefully back from his broad and noble brow; whilst
his dark flashing eye beamed with unspeakable joy, and the animation
that flooded his soul lent a thrill to his voice, and a majesty to his frame,
that I had never seen or heard before. Surely I was very proud and
happy as I looked on him then!</p>
          <p>Before we parted, Miss Nancy invited him and Louise to join us in
family devotion. After reading a chapter in the Bible, and a short but
eloquent and impressive prayer, she besought Heaven to shed its most
benign blessings on us; and that our approaching good fortune might
not make us forget Him from whom every good and perfect gift
emanated; and thus closed that delightful evening!</p>
          <p>After Henry had taken an affectionate farewell of me, and
<pb id="browne384" n="384"/>
departed with Louise, he, to my surprise, returned in a few moments,
and finding the house still open, called me out upon the balcony.</p>
          <p>“Dearest, I could not resist a strange impulse that urged me to come
back and look upon you once again. How beautiful you are, my love!”
he said as he pushed the masses of hair away from my brow, and
imprinted a kiss thereon. He was so tardy in leaving, that I had to chide
him two or three times.</p>
          <p>“I cannot leave you, darling.”</p>
          <p>“But think,” I replied, “of the joy that awaits us on the morrow.”</p>
          <p>At last, and at Miss Nancy's request, he left, but turned every few
steps to look back at the house.</p>
          <p>“How foolish Henry is to-night,” said Miss Nancy, as she withdrew
her head from the open window. “Success and love have made him
foolishly fond!”</p>
          <p>“Quite turned his brain,” I replied; “but he will soon be calm again.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes, he will find that life is an earnest work, as well for the
freeman as the bondsman.”</p>
          <p>I lay for a long time on my bed in a state of sleeplessness, and it was
past midnight when I fell asleep, and then, oh, what a terrible dream
came to torture me! I thought I had been stolen off by a kidnapper, and
confined for safe keeping in a charnel-house, an ancient receptacle for the
dead, and there, with blue lights burning round me, I lay amid the dried
bones and fleshless forms of those who had once been living beings; and
the vile and loathsome gases almost stifled me. By that dim blue light I
strove to find some door or means of egress from the terrible place, and
just as I had found the door and was about to fit a rusty key into the
lock, a long, lean body, decked out in shroud, winding-sheet and cap,
with hollow check and cadaverous face, and eyes devoid of all
speculation, suddenly seized me with its cold, skeleton hand. Slowly the
face assumed the expression of Lindy's, then faded into that of Mr.
Peterkin's. I attempted to break from it, but I was held with
<pb id="browne385" n="385"/>
a vice-like power. With a loud, frantic scream I broke from the
trammels of sleep. A cold, death-like sweat had broken out on my body.
My screaming had aroused Miss Nancy and Biddy. Both came rushing into my room.</p>
          <p>“A bad attack of incubus,” remarked Miss Nancy, “but she is
cold; rub her well, Biddy.”</p>
          <p>With a very good will the kind-hearted Irish girl obeyed her.
I could not, however, be prevailed upon to try to sleep again;
and as it wanted but an hour of the dawn, Biddy consented to
remain up with me. We dressed ourselves, and sitting down
by the closed window, entered into a very cheerful conversation.
Biddy related many wild legends of the “<hi rend="italics">ould country</hi>,” in which
I took great interest.</p>
          <p>Gradually we saw the stars disappear, and the moon go down, and
the pale gray streaks of dawn in the eastern sky!</p>
          <p>I threw up the windows, exclaiming: “Oh, Biddy, as the day
dawns, I begin to suffocate. I feel just as I did in the dream. Give me air,
quick.” More I could not utter, for I fell fainting in the arms of the
faithful girl. She dashed water in my face, chafed my hands and
temples, and consciousness soon returned.</p>
          <p>“Why, happiness and good fortune do excite you strangely;
but they say there are some that it sarves just so.”</p>
          <p>“Oh no, Biddy, I am not very well, — a little nervous. I will take some
medicine.”</p>
          <p>When I joined Miss Nancy, she refused to let me assist her
in dressing, saying:</p>
          <p>“No, Ann, you look ill. Don't trouble yourself to do anything, Go
lie down and rest.”</p>
          <p>I assured her repeatedly that I was perfectly well; but she only
smiled, and said in a commendatory tone,</p>
          <p>“Good girl, good girl!”</p>
          <p>All the morning I was fearfully nervous, starting at every little sound
or noise. At length Miss Nancy became seriously uneasy, and compelled
me to take a sedative.
<pb id="browne386" n="386"/>
As the day wore on, I began to grow calm. The sedative had taken effect,
and my nervousness was allayed.</p>
          <p>I took my sewing in the afternoon, and seated myself in Miss Nancy's room.
Seeing that I was calm, she began a pleasant conversation with me.</p>
          <p>“Henry will be here to-night, Ann, a free man, the owner of
himself, the custodian of his own person, and you must put on
your happiest and best looks to greet him.”</p>
          <p>“Ah, Miss Nancy, it seems like too much joy for me to realizes.
What if some grim phantom dash down this sparkling cup; just as we are 
about to press it to our eager and expecting lips? Such another disappointment
I could not endure.</p>
          <p>“You little goosey, you will mar half of life's joys by these
idle fears.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Miss Nancy,” put in Biddy. “Ann is just so
nervous ever since that ugly dream, that she hain't no faith to-day
in anything.”</p>
          <p>“Have you baked a pretty cake, and got plenty of nice confections
to give Henry a celebration supper, good Biddy?” inquired Miss Nancy.</p>
          <p>“Ah yes, everything is ready, only just look how light and brown my cake is,”
and she brought a fine large cake from the pantry, the savory odor of
which would have tempted an anchorite.</p>
          <p>“Then, too,” continued the provident Biddy, “the peaches are unusually soft and sweet. I have pared and sugared, and they are on the ice now;
oh, we'll have a rale feast.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks, thanks, good friends,” I said, in a voice choked with emotion.</p>
          <p>“Only just see,” exclaimed Biddy, “here comes Louise, running as fast as her legs will carry her; she's come to be the first to tell you that Henry is
free.”</p>
          <p>I rushed with Biddy to the door, and Miss Nancy followed.
We were all eager to hear the good news.</p>
          <p>“Mercy, Louise, what's the matter?” I cried, for her face terrified me.
She was pale as death; her eyes, black and wild,
<pb id="browne387" n="387"/>
seemed starting from their sockets, and around her mouth there
was that ghastly, livid look, that almost congealed my blood.</p>
          <p>“Oh, God!” she cried in frenzy, “God have mercy on us all!” and reeled against the wall.</p>
          <p>“Speak, woman, speak, in heaven's name,” I shouted aloud.
“Henry! Henry! Henry! has aught happened to him?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, God!” she said, and her eyes flamed like a fury's; “<hi rend="italics">he has cut his throat</hi>, and now lies weltering in his own blood.”</p>
          <p>I did not scream, I did not speak. I shed no tears. I did not even close
my eyes. Every sense had turned to stone!
For full five minutes I stood looking in the face of Louise.</p>
          <p>“Why don't you speak, Ann! Cry, imprecate, do something, rather
than stand there with that stony gaze!” said Louise, as she caught me
frantically by the arm.</p>
          <p>“Why did he kill himself?” I asked, in an unfaltering tone.</p>
          <p>“He went, in high spirits, to make his last payment to his master,
who was at the hotel. ‘Here, master,’ he said, ‘is all that I owe you;
please make out the bill of sale, or my free papers.’ Mr. Graham took
the money, with a smile, counted it over twice,
slowly placed it in his pocket-book, and said, ‘Henry, you are
my slave; I hired you to a good place, where you were well treated; had
time to make money for yourself. Now, according to law, you, as a
slave, cannot have or hold property. Everything, even to your knife,
is your master's. All of your earnings come to me. So, in point of law,
I was entitled to all the money that you have paid me. Legally it
was mine, not yours; so I did but receive from you my own.
Notwithstanding all this I was willing to let you have yourself, and
intended to act with you according to our first arrangement; but upon
coming here the other day, a servant girl of Mr. Bodly's named Lindy,
informed me that you were making preparations to run off, and
cheat me out of the last payment. She stated that you had told her so;
and you intended to start one night this week. I was so enraged by it, that yesterday I
<pb id="browne388" n="388"/>
sold you to a negro trader; and you must start down the river to-morrow.’ ”</p>
          <p>“ ‘Master, it is a lie of the girl's; I never had any thought of running off,
or cheating you out of your money.’ Henry then told him of Lindy's
malice.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Yes, you have proved it was a lie, by coming and paying me: but
nothing can be done now; I have signed the papers, and you are the
property of Atkins. I have not the power to undo what I have done.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘But, Master,’ pleaded Henry, ‘can't you refund the money that I have paid you, and let me buy myself from Mr. Atkins?’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Refund the money, indeed! Who ever heard of such impertinence?
Have I not just shown that all that you made was by right of law mine?
No; go down the river, serve your time, work well, and may be in the
course of fifteen or twenty years you may be able to buy yourself.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh, master!’ cried out the weeping Henry, ‘pity me, please save me, do something.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘I can do nothing for you; go, get your trunk ready, here comes Mr.
Atkins for you.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>Henry turned towards the hard trader, and with a face contracted
with pain, and eyes raining tears, begged for mercy.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Go long you fool of a nigger! an' git ready to go to the
pen, without this fuss, or I'll have you tied with ropes, and taken.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>Henry said no more; I had overheard all from an adjoining room. I
tried to avoid him; but he sought me out.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Louise,’ he said, in a tone which I shall never forget.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘I have heard all,’ was my reply.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Will you see Ann for me? Take her a word from me? Tell how it
was, Louise; break the news gently to her.’ Here he quite gave up, and,
sinking into a chair, sobbed and cried like a child.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“ ‘Be a friend to her, Louise; I know that she will need much kindness
to sustain her. Thank Miss Nancy for all her kindness;
<pb id="browne389" n="389"/>
tell her that I blest her before I went. Tell Ann to stay with her,
and oh, Louise’—here he wrung his hands in agony—‘tell Ann not to grieve
for me; but she mustn't forget me. Poor, wretched outcast that I am, I
have loved her well! After awhile, when time has softened this blow,
she must try to love and be happy with—No, no, I'll not ask that; only
bid her not be wretched;—but give me pen and ink, I'll write just one
word to her.’ <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“I gave him the ink, pen and paper, and he wrote this.”</p>
          <p>As Louise drew a soiled, blotted paper from her bosom, I eagerly
snatched it and read:</p>
          <p>“Ann, dearest, Louise will tell you all. Our dream is broken forever! I
<hi rend="italics">am sold</hi>; but I shall be a slave <hi rend="italics">no more</hi>. Forgive me for what I am going
to do. Madness has driven me to it! I love you, even in death I love
you. Say farewell to Miss Nancy—I <hi rend="italics">am gone</hi>!”</p>
          <p>I read it over twice slowly. One scalding tear, large and round, fell
upon it! I know not where it came from, for my eyes were dry as a
parched leaf.</p>
          <p>The note dropped from my hands, almost unnoticed by me. Biddy
picked it up, and handed it to Miss Nancy, who read it
and fainted. I moved about mechanically; assisted in restoring Miss
Nancy to consciousness; chafed her hands and temples;
and, when she came to, and burst into a flood of tears, I soothed her and
urged that she would not weep or distress herself.</p>
          <p>“I wonder that the earth don't open and swallow them,” cried the
weeping Biddy.</p>
          <p>“Hush, Biddy, hush!” I urged.</p>
          <p>“They ought to be hung!”</p>
          <p>“ ‘Vengeance is mine, and I will repay, saith the Lord,’ ” I replied.</p>
          <p>“Oh, Ann, you are crazy!” she uttered.</p>
          <p>And so, in truth, I was. That granite-like composure was a species of
insanity. I comprehended nothing that was going on around me. I was in
a sort of sleep-waking state, when I
<pb id="browne390" n="390"/>
asked Louise if she thought they would bury him decently;
and gave her a bunch of flowers to place in the coffin.</p>
          <p>And so my worst suspicion was realized! Through Lindy came my
heaviest blow of affliction! I fear that even now, after the lapse of
years, I have not the Christianity to ask,
“Father, forgive her, for she knew not what she did!” Lying beside
me now, dear, sympathetic reader, is <hi rend="italics">that note—his last brief words.</hi>
Before writing this chapter I read it over. Old, soiled and worn it was,
but by his trembling fingers those blotted and irregular lines were
penned; and to me they are precious, though they awaken ten thousand
bitter emotions! I look at the note but once a year, and then on the fatal
anniversary, which occurs to-day! I have pressed it to my heart, and
hearsed it away, not to be re-opened for another year. This is the
blackest chapter in my dark life, and you will feel, with me, glad that it
is about to close. I have nerved myself for the duty of recording it, and,
now that it is over, I sink down faint and broken-hearted beside the
accomplished task.</p>

            <p>A REVELATION—DEATH THE PEACEFUL ANGEL—CALMNESS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>MONTHS passed by after the events told in the last chapter—<hi rend="italics">passed</hi>, I
scarce know bow. They have told me that I wandered about like one in
the mazes of a troubled dream. My reason was disturbed. I've no
distinct idea how the days or weeks were employed. Vague
remembrances of kindly words, music, odorous flowers, and a trip to a
beautiful, quiet country-house, I sometimes have; but 'tis all so misty
and dream-like, that I can form no tangible idea of it. So this period has
almost faded out of mind, and is like lost pages from the chronicle of
life.</p>
          <p>When the winter was far spent, and during the snowy days of
February, my mind began to collect its shattered forces. The approach
of another trouble brought back consciousness with rekindled vigor.</p>
          <p>One day I became aware that Miss Nancy was very ill. It seemed as
if a thick vapor, like a breath-stain on glass, had suddenly been wiped
away from my mind; and I saw clearly. There lay Miss Nancy upon her
bed, appallingly white, with her large eyes sunken deeply in their
sockets, and her lips purple as an autumn leaf. Her thin, white hand,
with discolored nails, was thrown upon the covering, and aroused my
alarm. I rushed to her, fearing that the vital spark no longer animated
that loved and once lovely frame.</p>
          <p>“Miss Nancy, dear Miss Nancy,” I cried, “speak to me, only one
word.”</p>
          <p>She started nervously, “Oh, who are you? Ah, Ann—is it Ann?”</p>
          <pb id="browne392" n="392"/>
          <p>“Yes, dear Miss Nancy, it is <hi rend="italics">I</hi>. It appears as though a film
had been removed from my eyes, and I see how selfish I have been.
You have suffered for my attention. What has been the matter with me?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, dear child, a fearful dispensation of Providence was sent you;
and from the chastisement you are about recovering. Thank God,
that you are still the mistress of your reason! For its safety, I often trembled.
I did all for you that I could; but I was fearful that human skill would be of no avail.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks, my kind friend, and sorry I am for all the anxiety and
uneasiness that I have given you.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I am repaid, or rather was pre-paid for all and more, you
were so kind to me.”</p>
          <p>Here Biddy entered, and I took down the Bible and read a few
chapters from the book of Job.</p>
          <p>“What a comfort that book is to us,” said Biddy. “Many's
the time, Ann, that Miss Nancy read it to you, when you'd sit
an' look so wandering-like; but you are well now, Ann, an' all
will be right with us.” </p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">All</hi> can never be, Biddy, as once it <hi rend="italics">was</hi>,” and I shook my head.</p>
          <p>“Oh, don't spake of it,” and she wiped her moist eyes with
her apron.</p>
          <p>Days and weeks passed on thus smoothly, during which time Louise
came often to see us; but the fatal sorrow was never alluded to. By common
consent all avoided it.</p>
          <p>Daily, hourly, Miss Nancy's health sank. I never saw the footsteps of
the grim monster approach more rapidly than in her case. The wasting
of her cheek was like the eating of a worm at the heart of a rose.</p>
          <p>Her bed was wheeled close to the fire, and I read, all the pleasant
mornings, some cheerful book to her.</p>
          <p>Her brother came often, and sat with her through the evenings.
Many of her friends and neighbors offered to watch with
at night; but she bade me decline all such kindness.</p>
          <p>“You and Biddy are enough. I want no others. Let me die
<pb id="browne393" n="393"/>
calmly, in the presence of my own household, with no unusual faces
around,” she said in a low tone.</p>
          <p>She talked about her death as though it were some long journey upon
which she was about starting; gave directions how she should be
shrouded; what kind of coffin we must get, tomb-stone, &amp;c. She
enjoined that we inscribe nothing but her age and name upon the tomb-stone.</p>
          <p>“I wish no ostentatious slab, no false eulogium; my name and age
are all the epitaph I deserve, and all that I will have.”</p>
          <p>Several ministers came to see her, and held prayer. She received them
kindly, and spoke at length with some.</p>
          <p>“I shall meet the great change with resignation. I had hoped, Ann, to
see you well settled somewhere in the North; but that will be denied
me. In my will, I have remembered both you and Biddy. I have no
parting advice for either of you; for you are both, though of different
faith, consistent Christians. I hope we shall meet hereafter. You must
not weep, girls, for it pains me to think I leave you troubled.”</p>
          <p>When Biddy withdrew, she called me to her, saying,</p>
          <p>“Ann, I am feeble, draw near the bed whilst I talk to you. I hold here
in my hand a letter from my nephew, Robert Worth.”</p>
          <p>“Robert Worth? Why I—”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he says that he was at Mr. Peterkin's and remembers you well.
He also speaks of Emily Bradly, who is now in Boston; says that she
recollects you well, and is pleased to hear of your good fortune. Robert
is the son of my elder sister, who is now deceased; a favorite he always
was of mine. He read law in Mr. Trueman's office, and has a very
successful practice at the Boston bar. Long time ago, Ann, when I was a
young, blooming girl, my sister Lydia (Robert's mother) and I were at
school at a very celebrated academy in the North. During one of our
vacations, when we were on a visit to Boston—for we were country
girls—we were introduced to two young barristers, William Worth and
Justinian Trueman. They were strong personal friends.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <pb id="browne394" n="394"/>
          <p>“The former became much attached to my sister, and came
frequently to see her. Justinian Trueman came also. By the force of
circumstance, Mr. Trueman and I were thrown much together.
From his lofty conversation and noble principles, I gained great advantage.
I loved to listen to his candid avowal of free, democratic principles.
How bravely he set aside conventionality and empty forms; he was
a searcher after the soul of things! He was the very essence of honor, always
ready to sacrifice himself for others, and daily and hourly crucified his
heart!<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Chance threw us much together, as I have said. You may
infer what ensued. Two persons so similar in nature, so united
in purpose (though he was vastly my superior) could
not associate much together without a feeling of love
springing up! Our case did not differ from that of others. <hi rend="italics">We loved</hi>.
Not as the careless or ordinary love; but with a fervor,
a depth of passion, and a concentration of soul, which nothing
in life could destroy<corr sic=",">.</corr><corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“My sister was the chosen bride of William Worth. This fact
was known to all the household. Justinian and I read in each
other's manner the secret of the heart.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“At length, in one brief hour, he told me his story; he
was the only child of a widowed mother, who had spent her all upon his
education. Whilst he was away, her wants had been tenderly ministered to
by a very lovely young girl of wealth and social position. Upon her death-bed
his mother besought him to marry this lady. He was then inflamed with gratitude,
and, being free in heart, he mistook the nature of his feelings.
Whilst in this state of mind, he offered himself to her and was instantly
accepted. Afterwards when we met he understood how he had been beguiled!<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“He wrote to his betrothed, told her the state of his feelings,
that he loved another; but declared his willingness to redeem
his promise, and stand by his engagement if she wished.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“How anxiously we both awaited her reply! It came promptly, and
she desired, nay demanded, the fulfilment of
<pb id="browne395" n="395"/>
the engagement; even reminded him of his promise to his
mother, and of the obligation he was under to herself.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“No tongue can describe the agony that we both endured; yet
principle must be obeyed. We parted. They were married.
Twice afterwards I saw him. He was actively engaged in his
profession; but the pale check and earnest look told me that
he still thought lovingly of me! My sister married William Worth,
and resided in Boston; but her husband died early in life, leaving his
only child Robert to the care of Mr. Trueman. After my mother's death,
possessing myself of my patrimony, I removed west, to this city,
where my brother lived. I had been separated from him for a number
of years, and was surprised to find how entirely a Southern residence
had changed him. Owing to some little domestic difficulties, I declined
remaining in his family.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Last winter, when Justinian Trueman was here, I was out
of the city; and it was well that I was, for I could not have met him
again. Old feelings, that should be cradled to rest, would have been
aroused! My brother saw him, and told me that he looked well.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Now, is it not strange that you should have been an object
of such especial interest to both of us? It seems as though
you were a centre around which we were once more re-united. I have
written him a long letter, which I wish you to deliver upon your arrival
in Boston.” Here she drew from the portfolio that was lying on the bed
beside her, a sealed letter, directed to Justinian Trueman, Boston, Mass.</p>
          <p>I was weeping violently when I took it from her.</p>
          <p>She lingered thus for several weeks, and on a calm Sabbath morning,
as I was reading to her from the Bible, she said to me—</p>
          <p>“Ann, I am sleepy; my eyelids are closing; turn me over.”</p>
          <p>As I attempted to do it she pressed my hand tightly, straightened
her body out, and the last struggle was over! I was alone with her.
Laying her gently upon the pillow, I for the first time in my life
pressed my lips to that cold, marble brow. I
<pb id="browne396" n="396"/>
felt that she, holy saint, would not object to it, were, she able to speak. I then
called Biddy in to assist me. She was loud in her lamentation.</p>
          <p>“She bade us not weep for her, Biddy. She is happier now;” but,
though I spoke this in a composed tone, my heart was all astir with
emotion.</p>
          <p>Soon her brother came in, bringing with him a minister. He received
the mournful intelligence with subdued grief.</p>
          <p>We robed her for Death's bridal, e'en as she had requested,
in white silk, flannel, and white gloves. Her coffin was plain
mahogony, with a plate upon the top, upon which were engraved her
name, age, and birth-place.</p>
          <p>A funeral sermon was preached, by a minister who had been a strong personal
friend. In a retired portion of the public burial-ground we made her last
bed. A simple tombstone, as she directed, was placed over the grave,
her name, age, &amp;c., inscribed thereon.</p>
          <p>Bridget and I slept in the same house that night. We could not be
persuaded to leave it, and there, in Miss Nancy's dear, familiar room, we
held, as usual, family devotion. I almost fancied that she stood in the
midst, and was gazing upon us.</p>
          <p>That night I slept profoundly. My rest had been broken a great deal,
and now the knowledge that duty did not keep me awake, enabled me to
sleep well.</p>
          <p>On the next day Mr. Worth arrived, and was much distressed to find
that he was too late to see his aunt alive.</p>
          <p>Though he looked older and more serious than when I last saw him, I
readily recognized the same noble expression of face. He received me
very kindly, and thanked Biddy and me for our attentions to his
beloved aunt. He showed us a letter she had written, in which she spoke
of us in the kindest manner, and recommended us to his care.</p>
          <p>“Neither of you shall ever lack for friendship whilst I live,” he said,
as he warmly shook us by the hands.</p>
          <p>He told me that he had ever retained a vivid recollection of
<pb id="browne397" n="397"/>
my sad face; and inquired about “young Master.” When I told him that
he was dead, and gave an account of his life and sufferings, Mr. Worth
remarked—</p>
          <p>“Ah, yes, he was one of heaven's angels, lent us only for a short
season.”</p>
          <p>I accompanied him to his aunt's grave.</p>
          <p>
            <milestone n="* * * * * *" unit="typography"/>
          </p>
          <p>Upon the reading of the will, it was discovered that Miss Nancy had
liberated me, and left me, as a legacy, four thousand
dollars, with the request that I would live somewhere in the North. To
Biddy she had left a bequest of three thousand dollars; the remainder of
her fortune, after making a donation to her brother, was left to her
nephew, Robert Worth.</p>
          <p>The will was instantly carried into effect; as it met with no
opposition, and she owed no debts, matters were arranged satisfactorily;
and we prepared for departure.</p>
          <p>Louise had made all her arrangements to go with us. I was now a free
woman, in the possession of a comparative fortune; yet I was not
happy. Alas! I had out-lived all for which money and freedom were
valuable, and I cared not how the remainder of my days were spent.
Why cannot the means of happiness come to us when we have the
capacity for enjoyment?</p>
          <p>On the evening before our departure, I called Louise to me and asked,</p>
          <p>“Where is Henry's grave?” It was the first time since that fatal day
that I had mentioned his name to her.</p>
          <p>“He is buried far away, in a plain, unmarked grave; but, even if it
were near, you should not go,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“Tell me, who found him, after—after—after the <hi rend="italics">murder</hi>?”</p>
          <p>“Mr. Graham and Atkins went in search of him, and I followed
them; though he had told me what he was going to do, Ann, I could not
oppose or even dissuade him.”</p>
          <p>I wept freely; and, as is always the case, was relieved by it.</p>
          <p>“I am glad to see that you can weep. It will do you good,” said Louise.</p>
        </div2>

          <head>CHAPTER XLII.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>CONCLUSION.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>BUT little more remains to be told of my history.</p>
          <p>When Louise, Biddy and I, under the protection of Mr. Worth, sailed
on a pleasant steamer from the land of slavery, I could but thank my
God that I was leaving forever the State, beneath the sanction of whose
laws the vilest outrages and grossest inhumanities were committed!</p>
          <p>Our trip would, indeed, have been delightful, but that I was
constantly contrasting it in my own mind with what it might have been,
had HE not fallen a victim to the white man's cupidity.</p>
          <p>Often I stole away from the company, and, in the privacy of my
own room, gave vent to my pent-up grief. Biddy and Louise were in
ecstacies with everything that they saw.</p>
          <p>All along the route, after passing out of the Slave States, we met with
kind friends and genuine hospitality. The Northern people are noble,
generous, and philanthropic; and it affords me pleasure to record here a
tribute to their worth and kindness.</p>
          <p>In New York we met with the best of friends. Everywhere I saw
smiling, black faces; a sight rarely beheld in the cities and villages of the
South. I saw men and women of the despised race, who walked with
erect heads and respectable carriage, as though they realized that they
were men and women, not mere chattels.</p>
          <p>When we reached Boston I was made to feel this in a particular
manner. There I met full-blooded Africans, finely educated, in the
possession of princely talents, occupying good positions, wielding a
powerful political influence, and illustrating,
<pb id="browne399" n="399"/>
in their lives, the oft-disputed fact, that the African intellect
is equal to the Caucasian. Soon after my arrival in Boston I found out,
from Mr. Worth, the residence of Mr. Trueman, and called to see him.</p>
          <p>I was politely ushered by an Irish waiter into the study, where I
found Mr. Trueman engaged with a book. At first he did not recognize
me; but I soon made myself known, and received from him a most
hearty welcome.</p>
          <p>I related all the incidents in my life that had occurred since I had seen
him last. He entered fully into my feelings, and I saw the tear glisten in
his calm eyes when I spoke of poor Henry's awful fate.</p>
          <p>I told him of Miss Nancy's kindness, and the tears rolled down his
cheeks. I did not speak of what she had told me in relation to their
engagement; I merely stated that she had referred to him as a particular
personal friend, and when I gave him the letter he received it with a
tremulous hand, uttered a fearful groan, and buried his face among the
papers that lay scattered over his table. Without a spoken good-bye, I
withdrew.</p>
          <p>I saw him often after this; and from him received the most signal acts
of kindness. He thanked me many times for what he termed my fidelity
to his sainted friend. He never spoke of her without a quiver of the lip,
and I honored him for his constancy.</p>
          <p>He strongly urged me to take up my residence in Boston; but I
remembered that Henry's preference had always been for a New
England village; and I loved to think that I was following out his views,
and so I removed to a quiet puritanical little town in Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>And here I now am engaged in teaching a small school of African
children; happy in the discharge of so sacred a duty. 'Tis surprising to
see how rapidly they learn. I am interested, and so are they, in the
work; and thus what with some teachers is an irksome task, is to me a
pleasing duty.</p>
          <p>I should state for the benefit of the curious, that Biddy is
<pb id="browne400" n="400"/>
living in Boston, happily married to “a countryman,” and is the
proud mother of several blooming children. She comes to
visit me sometimes, during the heat of summer, and is always
a welcome guest.</p>
          <p>Louise, too, has consented to wear matrimony's easy yoke.
She still lives in the same village with me. Our social and friendly
relations still continue. I have frequently, when visiting Boston,
met Miss Bradly. She, like me, has never married. She has grown a
firmer and more earnest woman than she was in Kentucky. I must not
omit to mention the fact, that when travelling through Canada, I by the
rarest chance met Ben—Amy's treasure—now grown to be a fine-looking youth.</p>
          <p>He had a melancholy story—a life, like every other slave's,
full of trouble—but at length, by the sharpest ingenuity, he
made his escape, and reached, after many difficulties, the
golden shores of Canada!</p>
          <p>Now my history has been given—a round, unvarnished tale
it is; and thus, without ornament, I send it forth to the world.
I have spoken freely; at times, I grant, with a touch of bitterness,
but never without truth; and I ask the wise, the considerate, the earnest,
if I have not had cause for bitterness. Who can carp at me? That there are some
fiery Southerners who will assail me, I doubt not; but I feel satisfied that
I have discharged a duty that I solemnly owed to my oppressed and down-trodden
nation. I am calm and self-possessed; I have passed firmly through the severest
ordeal of persecution, and have been spared the death that has befallen many others. Surely I was saved for some wise purpose, and I fear nought from those who are fanatically wedded to wrong and inhumanity. Let them assail me as
they will, I shall feel that</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Thrise is he armed who has his quarrel just,</l>
            <l>And he but naked, though wrapped up in steel,</l>
            <l>Whose bosom with injustice is polluted.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>But there are others, some even in slave States, kind, noble,
thoughtful persons, earnest seekers after the highest good in
<pb id="browne401" n="401"/>
life and nature; to them I consign my little book, sincerely begging, that
through my weak appeal, my poor suffering
brothers and sisters, who yet wear the galling yoke of American
slavery, may be granted a hearing.</p>
          <p>From the distant rice-fields and sugar plantations of the fervid
South, comes a frantic wail from the wronged, injured, and oh,
how innocent African! Hear it; hear that cry, Christians of
the North, let it ring in your ears with its fearful agony!
Hearken to it, ye who feast upon the products of African labor!
Let it stay you in the use of those commodities for which their
life-blood, aye: more, their soul's life, is drained out drop by drop! Talk
no more, ye faint-hearted politicians, of “expediency.”
God will not hear your lame excuse in that grand and awful day, when
He shall come in pomp and power to judge the quick and dead.</p>
          <p>And so, my history, go forth and do thy mission! knock at the doors
of the lordly and wealthy; there, by the shaded light
of rosy lamps, tell your story. Creep in at the broken crevice of the
poor man's cabin, and there make your complaint. Into the ear of the
brave, energetic mechanic, sound the burden of your grief. To the strong-hearted
blacksmith, sweating over his furnace, make yourself heard; and
ask them, one and all, shall this unjust institution of slavery be
perpetuated? Shall it dare to desecrate, with its vile presence, the new territories
that are now emphatically free? Shall Nebraska and Kansas join in a
blood-spilling coalition with the South?</p>
          <p>Answer proudly, loudly, brave men; and answer, <hi rend="italics">No, No!</hi> My work is done.</p>
