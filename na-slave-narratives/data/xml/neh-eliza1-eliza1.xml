        <head>MEMOIR, &amp;C.</head>
        <p>In the following Narrative of “OLD ELIZABETH,” which
was taken mainly from her own lips in her 97th year, her 
simple language has been adhered to as strictly as was 
consistent with perspicuity and propriety.</p>
        <p>I was born in Maryland in the year 1766. My 
parents were slaves. Both my father and mother were 
religious people, and belonged to the Methodist 
Society. It was my father's practice to read in the 
Bible aloud to his children every sabbath morning. 
At these seasons, when I was but five years old, I often 
felt the overshadowing of the Lord's Spirit, without 
at all understanding what it meant; and these
incomes and influences continued to attend me until 
I was eleven years old, particularly when I was alone, 
by which I was preserved from doing anything that 
I thought was wrong.</p>
        <p>In the eleventh year of my age, my master sent 
me to another farm, several miles from my parents, 
brothers, and sisters, which was a great trouble to 
me. At last I grew so lonely and sad I thought I 
should die, if I did not see my mother. I asked the
<pb id="eliza4" n="4"/>
overseer if I might go, but being positively denied,
I concluded to go without his knowledge. When I
reached home my mother was away. I set off and
walked twenty miles before I found her. I staid
with her for several days, and we returned together.
Next day I was sent back to my new place, which
renewed my sorrow. At parting, my mother told
me that I had, “nobody in the wide world to look to
but God.” These words fell upon my heart with
<sic corr="ponderous">pondrous</sic> weight, and seemed to add to my grief.
I went back repeating as I went, “none but God in
the wide world.” On reaching the farm, I found
the overseer was displeased at me for going without 
his liberty. He tied me with a rope, and
gave me some stripes of which I carried the marks
for weeks.</p>
        <p>After this time, finding as my mother said, I had
none in the world to look to but God, I betook 
myself to prayer, and in every lonely place I found an
altar. I mourned sore like a dove and chattered forth
my sorrow, moaning in the corners of the field, and
under the fences.</p>
        <p>I continued in this state for about six months, feeling 
as though my head were waters, and I could do
nothing but weep. I lost my appetite, and not 
being able to take enough food to sustain nature, I 
became so weak I had but little strength to work; still
I was required to do all my duty. One evening, 
<pb id="eliza5" n="5"/>
after the duties of the day were ended, I thought I
could not live over the night, so threw myself on a
bench, expecting to die, and without being prepared
to meet my Maker; and my spirit cried within me,
must I die in this state, and be banished from Thy
presence forever? I own I am a sinner in Thy sight,
and not fit to live where thou art. Still it was my
fervent desire that the Lord would pardon me. Just
at this season, I saw with my spiritual eye, an awful
gulf of misery. As I thought I was about to plunge
into it, I heard a voice saying, “rise up and pray,”
which strengthened me. I fell on my knees and
prayed the best I could the Lord's prayer. Knowing 
no more to say, I halted, but continued on my
knees. My spirit was then <hi rend="italics">taught</hi> to pray, “Lord,
have mercy on me—Christ save me.” Immediately
there appeared a director, clothed in white raiment.
I thought he took me by the hand and said, “come
with me.” He led me down a long journey to a fiery
gulf, and left me standing upon the brink of this
awful pit. I began to scream for mercy, thinking I
was about to be plunged to the belly of hell, and 
believed I should sink to endless ruin. Although I
prayed and wrestled with all my might, it seemed
in vain. Still, I felt all the while that I was 
sustained by some invisible power. At this solemn 
moment, I thought I saw a hand from which hung, as
it were, a silver hair, and a voice told me that all
<pb id="eliza6" n="6"/>
the hope I had of being saved was no more than a 
hair; still, pray, and it will be sufficient. I then 
renewed my struggle, crying for mercy and salvation, 
until I found that every cry raised me higher and 
higher, and my head was quite above the fiery pillars. 
Then I thought I was permitted to look straight 
forward, and saw the Saviour standing with His hand 
stretched out to receive me. An indescribably 
glorious light was <hi rend="italics">in</hi> Him, and He said, “peace, peace, 
come unto me.” At this moment I felt that my sins 
were forgiven me, and the time of my deliverance 
was at hand. I sprang forward and fell at his feet, 
giving Him all the thanks and highest praises, crying, 
Thou hast redeemed me—Thou hast redeemed 
me to thyself. I felt filled with light and love. At 
this moment I thought my former guide took me 
again by the hand and led me upward, till I came to 
the celestial world and to heaven's door, which I saw 
was open, and while I stood there, a power
surrounded me which drew me in, and I saw millions 
of glorified spirits in white robes. After I had this 
view, I thought I heard a voice saying, “Art thou 
willing to be saved?” I said, Yes Lord. Again I was 
asked, “Art thou willing to be saved in my way?”
I stood speechless until he asked me again, “Art 
thou willing to be saved in my way?” Then I heard 
a whispering voice say, “If thou art not saved in the 
Lord's way, thou canst not be saved at all;” at which
<pb id="eliza7" n="7"/>
I exclaimed, “Yes Lord, in thy own way.” Immediately 
a light fell upon my head, and I was filled 
with light, and I was shown the world lying in wickedness, 
and was told I must go there, and call the 
people to repentance, for the day of the Lord was at 
hand; and this message was as a heavy yoke upon 
me, so that I wept bitterly at the thought of what I 
should have to pass through. While I wept, I heard 
a voice say, “weep not, some will laugh at thee,
some will scoff at thee, and the dogs will bark at 
thee, but while thou doest my will, I will be with 
thee to the ends of the earth.<corr>”</corr></p>
        <p>I was at this time not yet thirteen years old. The 
next day, when I had come to myself, I felt like a 
new creature in Christ, and all my desire was to see 
the Saviour.</p>
        <p>I lived in a place where there was no preaching, 
and no religious instruction; but every day I went out 
amongst the hay-stacks, where the presence of the 
Lord overshadowed me, and I was filled with sweetness 
and joy, and was as a vessel filled with holy oil. 
In this way I continued for about a year; many 
times while my hands were at my work, my spirit 
was carried away to spiritual things. One day as I 
was going to my old place behind the hay-stacks to 
pray, I was assailed with this language, “Are you 
going there to weep and pray? what a fool! there 
are older professors than you are, and they do not
<pb id="eliza8" n="8"/>
take that way to get to heaven; people whose sins 
are forgiven ought to be joyful and lively, and not 
be struggling and praying.” With this I halted and 
concluded I would not go, but do as other professors 
did, and so went off to play; but at this moment 
the light that was in me became darkened, and the 
peace and joy that I once had, departed from me.</p>
        <p>About this time I was moved back to the farm 
where my mother lived, and then sold to a stranger. 
Here I had deep sorrows and plungings, not having 
experienced a return of that sweet evidence and 
light with which I had been favoured formerly; but 
by watching unto prayer, and wrestling mightily 
with the Lord, my peace gradually returned, and 
with it a great exercise and weight upon my heart 
for the salvation of my fellow-creatures; and I was
often carried to distant lands and shown places where 
I should have to travel and deliver the Lord's message.
Years afterwards, I found myself visiting 
those towns and countries that I had seen in the 
light as I sat it home at my sewing,—places of 
which I had never heard.</p>
        <p>Some years from this time I was sold to a 
Presbyterian for a term of years, as he did not think it 
right to hold slaves for life. Having served him 
faithfully my time out, he gave me my liberty, 
which was about the thirtieth year of my age.</p>
        <p>As I now lived in a neighborhood where I could
<pb id="eliza9" n="9"/>
attend religious meetings, occasionally I felt moved to
speak a few words therein; but I shrank from it—so great
was the cross to my nature.</p>
        <p>I did not speak much till I had reached my forty-second
year, when it was revealed to me that the message which
had been given to me I had not yet delivered, and the time
had come. As I could read but little, I questioned within
myself how it would be possible for me to deliver the
message, when I did not understand the Scriptures.
Whereupon I was moved to open a Bible that was near me,
which I did, and my eyes fell upon this passage, “Gird up
thy loins now like a man, and answer thou me. Obey God
rather than man,”&amp;c.  Here I fell into a great exercise of
spirit, and was plunged very low. I went from one religious
professor to another, enquiring of them what ailed me; but
of all these I could find none who could throw any light
upon such impressions. They all told me there was nothing
in Scripture that would sanction such exercises. It was
hard for men to travel, and what would women do? These
things greatly discouraged me, and shut up my way, and
caused me to resist the Spirit. After going to all that were
accounted pious, and receiving no help, I returned to the
Lord, feeling that I was nothing, and knew nothing, and
wrestled and prayed to the Lord that he would fully reveal
His will, and make the way plain.</p>
        <pb id="eliza10" n="10"/>
        <p>Whilst I thus struggled, there seemed a light from
heaven to fall upon me, which banished all my desponding
fears, and I was enabled to form a new resolution to go on
to prison and to death, if it might be my portion: and the
Lord showed me that it was His will I should be resigned
to die any death that might be my lot, in carrying his
message, and be entirely crucified to the world, and
sacrifice <hi rend="italics">all</hi> to His glory that was then in my possession,
which His witnesses, the holy Apostles, had done before
me. It was then revealed to me that the Lord had given me
the evidence of a clean heart, in which I could rejoice day
and night, and I walked and talked with God, and my soul
was illuminated with heavenly light, and I knew nothing
but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</p>
        <p>One day, after those things, while I was at my work, the
Spirit directed me to go to a poor widow, and ask her if I
might have a meeting at her house, 
which was situated in one of the lowest and worst
streets in Baltimore. With great joy she gave 
notice, and at the time appointed I appeared there
among a few coloured sisters. When they had all
prayed, they called upon me to close the meeting,
and I felt an impression that I must say a few words;
and while I was speaking, the house seemed filled
with light; and when I was about to close the meeting, 
and was kneeling, a man came in and stood till
<pb id="eliza11" n="11"/>
I arose. It proved to be a watchman. The sisters became so
frightened, they all went away except the one who lived in
the house, and an old woman; they both appeared to be
much frightened, fearing they should receive some
personal injury, or be put out of the house. A feeling of
weakness came over me for a short time, but I soon grew
warm and courageous in the Spirit. The man then said to
me, “I was sent here to break up your meeting. Complaint
has been made to me that the people round here cannot
sleep for the racket.” I replied, “a good racket is better than
a bad racket. How do they rest when the ungodly are
dancing and fiddling till midnight? Why are not they
molested by the watchmen? and why should we be for
praising God, our Maker? Are we worthy of greater
punishment for praying to Him? and are we to be
prohibited from doing so, that sinners may remain
slumbering in their sins?” While speaking these few words
I grew warm with <hi rend="italics">heavenly</hi> zeal, and laid my hand upon
him and addressed him with gospel truth, “how do sinners
sleep in hell, after slumbering in their sins here, and crying,
‘let me rest, let me rest,’ while sporting on the very brink of
hell? Is the cause of God to be destroyed for this purpose?” 
Speaking several words more to this amount, he turned
pale and trembled, and begged my pardon, acknowledging
that it was not his wish to interrupt us, and that
<pb id="eliza12" n="12"/>
he would never disturb a religious assembly again. He then
took leave of me in a comely manner and wished us
success. After he was gone, I turned to the old sisters who
by this time were quite cheered up. You see, said I, if the
sisters had not fled, what a victory we might have had on
the Lord's side; for the man seemed ready to give up under
conviction. If it had not been for their cowardice, we might
have all bowed in prayer, and a shout of victory had been
heard amongst us.</p>
        <p>Our meeting gave great offence, and we were forbid
holding any more assemblies. Even the elders of our
meeting joined with the wicked people, and said such
meetings must be stopped, and that woman quieted. But I
was not afraid of any of them, and continued to go, and
burnt with a zeal not my own. The old sisters were zealous
sometimes, and at other times would sink under the cross.
Thus they grow cold, at which I was much grieved. I
proposed to them to ask the elders to send a brother, which
was concluded upon.</p>
        <p>We went on for several years, and the Lord was with us
with great power it proved, to the conversion of many
souls, and we continued to grow stronger.</p>
        <p>I felt at times that I must exercise in the ministry,
but when I rose upon my feet I felt <sic corr="ashamed">ashmed</sic>, and so
I went under a cloud for some time, and endeavoured
<pb id="eliza13" n="13"/>
to keep silence; but I could not quench the
Spirit. I was rejected by the elders and rulers, as
Christ was rejected by the Jews before me, and
while others were excused in crimes of the darkest
dye, I was hunted down in every place where I 
appointed a meeting. Wading through many sorrows,
I thought at times I might as well be banished from
this life, as to feel the Almighty drawing me one
way, and man another; so that I was tempted to
cast myself into the dock. But contemplating the
length of eternity, and how long my sufferings would
be in that unchangeable world, compared with this, if I
endured a little longer, the Lord was pleased to deliver me
from this gloomy, melancholy state in his own time;
though while this temptation lasted I roved up and down,
and talked and prayed.</p>
        <p>I often felt that I was unfit to assemble with the 
congregation with whom I had gathered, and had sometimes
been made to rejoice in the Lord. I felt that I was despised
on account of this gracious calling, and was looked upon
as a speckled bird by the ministers to whom I looked for
instruction, and to whom I resorted every opportunity for
the same; but when I would converse with them, some
would cry out, “You are an enthusiast;” and others said,
“the Discipline did not allow of any such division of the
work;” until I began to think I surely must be wrong.
Under this reflection, I had another gloomy
<pb id="eliza14" n="14"/>
cloud to struggle through; but after awhile I felt much
moved upon by the Spirit of the Lord, and meeting with an
aged sister, I found upon conversing with her that she
could sympathize with me in this spiritual work. She was the
first one I had met with, who could fully understand my
exercises. She offered to open her house for a meeting,
and run the risk of all the church would do to her for it.
Many were afraid to open their houses in this way, lest
they should be turned out of the church.</p>
        <p>I persevered, notwithstanding the opposition of those
who were looked upon as higher and wiser. The meeting
was appointed, and but few came. I felt much
backwardness, and as though I could not pray, but a
pressure upon me to arise and express myself by way of
exhortation. After hesitating for some time whether I would
take up the cross or no, I arose, and after expressing a few
words, the Spirit came upon me with life, and a victory was
gained over the power of darkness, and we could rejoice
together in His love.</p>
        <p>As for myself, I was so full I hardly knew whether I was
in the body, or out of the body—so great was my joy for the
victory on the Lord's side. But the persecution against me 
increased, and a complaint was carried forward, as was 
done formerly against Daniel, the servant of God, and 
the elders came out
<pb id="eliza15" n="15"/>
with indignation for my holding meetings contrary to
discipline—being a woman.</p>
        <p>Thus we see when the heart is not inspired, and the
inward eye enlightened by the Spirit, we are incapable of
discerning the mystery of God in these things. Individuals
creep into the church that are unregenerate, and after they
have been there awhile, they fancy that they have got the
grace of God, while they are destitute of it. They may have
a degree of light in their heads, but evil in their hearts;
which makes them think they are qualified to be judges of
the ministry, and their conceit makes them very busy in
matters of religion, judging of the revelations that are
given to others, while they have received none
themselves. Being thus mistaken, they are calculated to
make a great deal of confusion in the church, and clog the
true ministry.</p>
        <p>These are they who eat their own bread, and wear their
own apparel, having the form of godliness, but are
destitute of the power.</p>
        <p>Again I felt encouraged to attend another and 
another appointment. At one of these meetings, some
of the class-leaders were present, who were 
constrained to cry out, “Surely the Lord has <hi rend="italics">revealed</hi>
these things to her” and asked one another if they
ever heard the like? I look upon man as a very
selfish being, when placed in a religious office, to
presume to resist the work of the Almighty;
<pb id="eliza16" n="16"/>
because He does not work by man's authority. I did 
not faint under discouragement, but pressed on.</p>
        <p>Under the contemplation of these things, I slept but little,
being much engaged in receiving the revelations of the
Divine will concerning this work, and the mysterious call
thereto.</p>
        <p>I felt very unworthy and small, notwithstanding the Lord
had shown himself with great power, insomuch that
conjecturers and critics were constrained to join in praise to
his great name; for truly, we had times of refreshing from the
presence of the Lord. At one of the meetings, a vast number
of the white inhabitants of the place, and many coloured
people, attended—many no doubt from curiosity to hear what
the old coloured woman had to say. One, a great scripturian,
fixed himself behind the door with pen and ink, in order to
take down the discourse in short-hand; but the Almighty
Being anointed me with such a portion of his Spirit, that he
cast away his paper and pen, and heard the discourse with
patience, and was much affected, for the Lord wrought
powerfully on his heart. After meeting, he came forward and
offered me his hand with solemnity on his countenance, and
handed me something to pay for my conveyance home.</p>
        <p>I returned, much strengthened by the Lord's power, to go
on to the <sic corr="fulfillment">fulfilment</sic> of His work, although I was again
pressed by the authorities of
<pb id="eliza17" n="17"/>
the church to which I belonged, for imprudency; and so
much condemned, that I was sorely tempted by the
enemy to turn aside into the wilderness. I was so
embarrassed and encompassed, I wondered within myself
whether all that were called to be mouth piece for the Lord,
suffered such deep wadings as I experienced.</p>
        <p>I now found I had to travel still more extensively in the
work of the ministry, and I applied to the Lord for direction.
I was often <hi rend="italics">invited</hi> to go hither and thither, but felt that I
must wait for the dictates of His Spirit.</p>
        <p>At a meeting which I held in Maryland, I was led to
speak from the passage, “Woe to the rebellious city,”&amp;c. After the meeting, the people came where I was, to take me
before the squire; but the Lord delivered me from their
hands.</p>
        <p>I also held meetings in Virginia. The people there would
not believe that a coloured woman could preach. And
moreover, as she had no learning, they strove to imprison
me because I spoke against slavery: and being brought up,
they asked by what authority I spake? and if I had been
ordained? I answered, not by the commission of men's
hands: if the Lord had ordained me, I needed nothing
better.</p>
        <p>As I travelled along through the land, I was led at
different times to converse with white men who
<pb id="eliza18" n="18"/>
were by profession ministers of the gospel. Many of them,
up and down, confessed they did not believe in revelation,
which gave me to see that men were sent forth as ministers
without Christ's authority. In a conversation with one of
these, he said, “You think you have these things by
revelation, but there has been no such thing as revelation
since Christ's ascension.” I asked him where the apostle
John got his revelation while he was in the Isle of Patmos.
With this, he rose up and left me, and I said in my spirit, get
thee behind me Satan.</p>
        <p>I visited many remote places, where there were no
meeting houses, and held many <sic corr="glorious">glorions</sic> meetings, for the
Lord poured out his Spirit in sweet effusions. I also
travelled in Canada, and visited several settlements of
coloured people, and felt an open door amongst them.</p>
        <p>I may here remark, that while journeying through the
different states of the Union, I met with many of the Quaker
Friends, and visited them in their families. I received much
kindness and sympathy, and no opposition from them, in
the prosecution of my labours.</p>
        <p>On one occasion, in a thinly settled part of the country,
seeing a Friend's meeting house open, I went in; at the
same time a Friend and his little daughter followed me. We
three composed the meeting. As we sat there in silence, I
felt a 
<pb id="eliza19" n="19"/>
remarkable overshadowing of the Divine presence, as much so
as I ever experienced any where. Toward the close, a few
words seemed to be given me, which I expressed, and left
the place greatly refreshed in Spirit. From thence I went to
Michigan, where I found a wide field of labour amongst my
own colour. Here I remained four years. I established a
school for coloured orphans, having always felt the great
importance of the religious and moral <hi rend="italics">agri</hi>culture of children,
and the great need of it, especially amongst the coloured
people. Having white teachers, I met with much
encouragement.</p>
        <p>My eighty-seventh year had now arrived, when suffering
from disease, and feeling released from travelling further in
my good Master's cause, I came on to Philadelphia, where I
have remained until this time, which brings me to my 
ninety-seventh year. When I went forth, it was without purse or
scrip,—and I have come through great tribulation and
temptation—not by any might of my own, for I feel that I am
but as dust and ashes before my almighty Helper, who has,
according to His promise, been with me and sustained me
through all, and gives me now firm faith that he will be with
me to the end, and, in his own good time, receive me into
His everlasting rest.</p>
