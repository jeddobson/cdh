        <head>NARRATIVE OF HENRY WATSON.</head>
        <p>I WAS born in Virginia, about thirteen miles from
Fredericksburg, as near as I can now recollect, in the
year 1813. Mother was a slave, and belonged to a man
by the name of Bibb, whose Christian name I cannot
remember. My mother was called Letty. Slaves seldom
have but one name; and I never heard her called by
any other. I was at that time called Bill. I never had
any brother or sister, that I know of. Like the most of
my brothers in bondage, I have no correct account of
my age. Slaves keep the birth of their children by the 
different seasons of the year. Children often ask their 
parents their age. The answer is, “this planting corn 
time, you are six, eight, or ten,” just as it may happen 
to be; but even this knowledge was I deprived of by my 
master, who was one of those proud Virginians, whose 
principal business was to raise slaves for the market; 
though I was permitted to remain with my mother on his 
plantation until I was about eight years of age. My
mother was the cook at what slaves call the great house. 
I was allowed to remain with her at the house. The
<pb id="watson6" n="6"/>
last time saw her, she placed me on the bed, which 
was in a room adjoining the kitchen, and bid me go to 
sleep, saying that she would be back again in a few 
moments. I did so; and when I awoke in the morning 
I found myself in the great house, wrapped up in a 
blanket, before the fire. I could not account for this 
change that had been made with me through the 
night. I asked for my mother, but no one spoke. I 
went out into the kitchen, where she used to work. She 
was not there, and it was evident to me, that she was 
gone; where, I knew not. I returned to the house, 
and implored my mistress, with tears in my eyes, to tell
me where my mother had gone. She refused, though a
mother herself, to give me any satisfaction whatever. 
Every exertion was made on my part to find her, or 
hear some tidings of her; but all my efforts were 
unsuccessful; and from that day have never seen or 
heard from her. This cruel separation brought on a fit 
of sickness, from which they did not expect I would 
recover. The old slave-woman who took care of me 
during my sickness, by way of consolation, gave me as
much information as she could about my mother's being
taken away. She told me that a slave-dealer drove to
the door in a buggy, and my mother was sent for to
come into the house; when, getting inside, she was
knocked down, tied, and thrown into the buggy, and 
carried away. As the old woman related these things to me, I
felt as if all hope was gone; that I was forsaken and alone
in this world. More forcibly did I then feel the galling
chains of slavery, the cruelty and barbarism arising from 
it, than I ever have since. I resolved, however, to bear 
with all patiently, till I became large enough to run 
away, and search for my mother.</p>
        <pb id="watson7" n="7"/>
        <p>I had recovered from my sickness but a few months, 
when one day, looking up the road, I saw a man riding 
towards the house; I ran with the rest of the children to 
hide ourselves until the man had gone. When I had 
remained concealed some time, I ventured out again, and 
found Mr. Bibb, my master, looking for me, who ordered 
me into the house; and when I got there, to my astonishment, 
I found the man whom we had hid ourselves from, sitting 
in the room. After he had inspected me to his satisfaction, 
I was ordered out of the room, and went to play, 
and had I forgotten the whole affair, when my master 
called me again, and ordered me to hold the stranger's 
horse. I did so, and in a few minutes he came forth and 
ordered me to mount behind him. This, with his assistance, 
I did; but rode only a short distance, when I 
jumped from the horse and ran for the house as fast as I 
could. He succeeded, however, in overtaking me, and 
I was again put on the horse, this time in front of 
him; and in this way was I carried to Fredericksburg. 
I was then placed in the possession of Mr. Janer, better 
known as Parson Janer; the man that had bought me 
being the son of Mr. Janer, who was one of those jolly, 
good-natured clergymen, who, while he feasted his 
numerous guests in the parlor, starved his slaves in the 
kitchen. After remaining there awhile, it was 
determined to send me to Richmond. The same man that 
brought me, came for me and ordered me to take a seat 
on the stage-coach, and the next day I found myself in 
Richmond, and stopped at the Eagle Hotel, kept by Mr. 
Holman, where I remained two or three days, and then 
was carried to the auction room; entering which, I found 
several slaves, seated around the room waiting for the
<pb id="watson8" n="8"/>
hour of sale. Some were in tears; others were 
apparently cheerful. This brought to my mind my mother, 
and caused me to shed many tears; but they fell 
unheeded. The auctioneer was busy examining the slaves
before the sale commenced. At last everything was 
ready, and the traffic in human flesh began. I will 
<pb id="watson9" n="9"/>
attempt to give as accurate an account of the language and
ceremony of a slave auction as I possibly can. 
“Gentlemen, here is a likely boy; how much? He is sold for
no fault; the owner wants money. His age is forty.
Three hundred dollars is all that I am offered for him. 
Please to examine him; he is warranted sound. Boy, pull
off your shirt—roll up your pants—for we want to see
if you have been whipped.” If they discover any scars, 
they will not buy; saying that the nigger is a bad one. 
The auctioneer seeing this, cries, “Three hundred 
dollars, gentlemen, three hundred dollars. Shall I sell him 
for three hundred dollars? I have just been informed 
by his master, that he is an honest boy, and belongs to 
the same church that he does.” This turns the tide 
frequently, and the bids go up fast; and he is knocked off 
for a good sum. After the men and women are sold, the 
children are put on the stand. I was the first put up. 
On my appearance, several voices cried, “How old is that
little nigger?” On hearing this expression, I again burst
into tears, and wept so that I have no distinct recollection 
of his answer. I was at length knocked down, to a
man whose name was Denton, a slave trader, then
purchasing slaves for the Southern market. His first
name I have forgotten. Each one of the traders has
private jails, which are for the purpose of keeping slaves
in; and they are generally kept by some confidential
slave. Denton had one of these jails, to which I was
conducted by his trusty slave; and on entering I found
a great many slaves there, waiting to be sent off as soon
as their numbers increased. These jails are enclosed by
a wall about 16 feet high, and the yard-room is for the
slaves to exercise in; and consists of but one room, in
<pb id="watson10" n="10"/>
which all sexes and ages are huddled together in a mass.
I stayed in this jail but two days, when the number was 
completed, and we were called out to form a line. Horses 
and wagons were in readiness to carry our provisions 
and tents, so that we might camp out at night. Before 
we had proceeded far, Mr. Denton gave orders for us to 
stop, for the purpose of handcuffing some of the men, 
which, he said in a loud voice, “had the devil in them.” 
The men belonging to this drove were all married men, 
and all leaving their wives and children behind; he, judging 
from their tears that they were unwilling to go, had
them made secure. We started again on our journey,
Mr. Denton taking the lead in his sulky; and the driver,
Mr. Thornton, brought the rear. I will not weary
my readers with the particulars of our march to Tennessee, 
where we stopped several days for the purpose of
arranging our clothes. While stopping, the men were
hired out to pick cotton. While in Tennessee, we lost
four of our number, who died from exposure on the road.
After the lapse of three weeks, we started again on our
journey, and in about four weeks arrived in Natchez,
Miss., and went to our pen, which Mr. Denton had 
previously hired for us; and had our irons taken off and our
clothes changed; for Mr. Denton was expecting visitors
to examine the flock, as he would sometimes term us.
There was a sign-board in front of the house, which 
informed traders that he had on hand, blacksmiths, carpenters, 
field-hands; also several sickly ones, whom he would
sell very cheap. In a short time purchasers became
plenty, and our number diminished. I was not sold for
several weeks, though I wished to be the first, not 
wishing to witness his cruelty to his slaves any longer; for
<pb id="watson11" n="11"/>
[ILLUSTRATION]
<pb id="watson12" n="12"/>
if they displeased him in the least, he would order them 
to be stripped, and tied hand and foot together. He 
would then have his paddle brought, which was a board 
about two feet in length and one inch in thickness, having 
fourteen holes bored through it, about an inch in 
circumference. This instrument of torture he would 
apply, until the slave was exhausted, on parts which the 
purchaser would not be likely to examine. This mode of 
punishment is considered one of the most cruel ever 
invented, as the flesh protrudes through these holes at 
every blow, and forms bunches and blisters the size of 
each hole, causing much lameness and soreness to the 
person receiving them. This punishment is generally 
inflicted in the morning, before visitors come to examine 
the slaves</p>
        <p>Just before the doors are opened, it is usual for the 
keeper to grease the mouths of the slaves, so as to make 
it appear that they are well and hearty, and have just 
done eating fat meat; though they seldom, if ever, while 
in the custody of the keeper, taste a morsel of meat 
of any kind.</p>
        <p>At length, a man made his appearance; the very man
of all others I had ever seen, from whom I should
shrink, and be afraid. He was dark-complexioned, had
sharp, grey eyes, a peaked nose, and compressed lips; 
indeed, he was a very bad-looking man. I never wish 
to look upon his face again. His name was Alexander
McNeill, a member of the firm of McNeill, Fiske &amp; Co.
He said he wanted a boy to bring up to suit himself.
He took a great fancy to me, and after some discussion
about the price, agreed at last to give five hundred 
dollars for me. I quit my old quarters, and went with my
<pb id="watson13" n="13"/>
new master to his store. He told me my duty for the 
future would be, to wait upon him,—“to jump when I 
was spoken to, run when sent upon errands, and if I did 
not mind my P's and Q's, I should be flogged like h—l.”</p>
        <p>As I did not like my new master's appearance, I at
once concluded to please him in all things. But it was all
in vain; for the first morning I was severely flogged for
not placing his clothes in the proper position on the
chair. The second morning I received another severe
flogging for not giving his boots as good a polish as he
thought they had been accustomed to. Thus he went on
in cruelty, and met every new effort of mine to please 
him with fresh blows from his cowhide, which he kept
hung up in his room for that purpose. In a few days he
made arrangements for a journey, on which I was to 
accompany him. The object of his journey was made
known to me by some of his servants; and, as that journey 
turned out to be of great importance to me, I will
give it to the world, as I got it from my author. My
master was a married man. Although I had never seen
my mistress, as she was living with her mother, sixty
miles from the city,—she having found out, while living
with her husband in the city, that he had made a wife of
one of his slaves, had left him, and had gone to her 
mother; and the object of his journey was to induce her
to come back and live with him. I accompanied him
on this journey; and, although he made every effort on
his part to induce her to return, she refused to do so.
He returned to Natchez, enraged at his ill success, and
determined never to make another attempt at reconciliation. 
He concluded to leave the city, and he 
purchased a farm near Vicksburg, on the Mississippi River,
<pb id="watson14" n="14"/>
upon which he settled. My master always was a cruel
man; but ever since his unsuccessful effort at reconciliation 
with his wife, he became a perfect tyrant, lashing
his slaves without mercy. This shows one of the many
ways in which the licentious slaveholder inflicts pain on
poor slaves; robbing them, by force, of their virtue, then
lacerating their backs for having allowed themselves
thus to be forced. He had not been long on his farm
before he took another of his slave-women to wife, by
whom he had two children. These children were not
treated any better than any other slave's; the mother
being out in the field all the day, and in his room at
night. Upon this farm were one hundred field-hands,
and two house servants, the cook and myself. For the
accommodation of the field-hands there were twenty-seven
cabins, one hospital, one jail, one gin-house; at which
house, as in the jail, there are two pair of stocks, for the
torture of slaves. As the stocks on farms are different
in their construction from those commonly used in cities,
I will give a description of them. They consisted of two
rough logs, generally about twelve feet in length, one of
them laid upon the ground, with notches cut in it to fit
the neck and arms; the other log, which was cut with
corresponding notches, was placed upon the victim to
keep him in his position. They were fastened at one end
by a massive hinge; and when the sufferer was in them,
the other end was secured by a large padlock. There
were other modes of punishing; but these were used for
extreme cases, such as running away, or stealing, &amp;c. 
On the occasions of whipping by the stocks, it was my
duty to be present; and at the end of each hundred, to
apply salt to the bleeding back of the sufferer till the
<pb id="watson15" n="15"/>
blood was stanched, when the whipping was renewed,
until the delinquent had received four or five hundred
lashes. These cruelties were principally inflicted by the
overseer, who was a drunken, quarrelsome person, whom
it was impossible to please; and when he was in liquor
he took very great delight in inflicting punishment on the
slaves. Beside the overseer there was a driver, one of
the slaves, named Harry. He had a wife and children,
whom, in case of their being slightly in fault, he would
have to lash with an unflinching hand; there being no
sympathy allowed to be shown, between even man and
wife. I will relate a circumstance, which made a very
great impression on my mind at that time. There was a
slave on the farm by the name of Jo<corr sic=",">.</corr> The overseer
had threatened to put him in the stocks, for some trivial
offence. Jo, dreading the severity of the punishment,
ran away, which fact was soon brought to my master's
knowledge, who ordered the overseer to shoot him the
first time he saw him. The overseer, being a bloodthirsty 
fiend, like my master, kept strict watch for Jo;
and the second night, he saw him but a short distance 
from his cabin, where he was probably going for the 
purpose of seeing his wife, and getting something to eat; but
he never saw those eyes light up with pleasure,—never 
heard the sweet music of their voices, or felt their warm 
embrace,—for the incarnate fiend's aim was too sure; 
he was stretched dead in an instant. Yes; this man was 
hurried into the presence of his Maker, without the power 
of speaking one word of prayer. On the master being 
informed that his brutal order had been obeyed, he gave 
orders that his body should not be removed from the 
spot where he fell, as he wished it to serve as an 
<pb id="watson16" n="16"/>
example to the rest of us; and there it remained, the
vultures rioting and feasting on the remains of a man,
whose only fault was a black skin.</p>
        <p>Never shall I forget the horrible sensation that passed 
through my veins as I gazed upon the mutilated body 
of this poor man; but alas! I could do nothing; I was
myself a slave. My heart grew sad; I dropped a tear
to his memory and departed, cherishing a hope, that at
no distant day, I would be free. Although these facts were 
known to the neighbors, yet no one asked even a question 
about it. He was a slave; no one cared for him. I say 
no one—I am wrong; where was the slave's wife? 
where were the slave's children?—had they no tears to
shed? Ah! yes, many; not tears from physical pain; 
but tears, scalding tears of pure grief. The husband 
and father, shot like a dog before them; his bleeding 
form, writhing in agony, and the sightless eyeballs glaring 
upon them; and they dare not approach to straighten 
his stiffening limbs, or close his sightless eyes. Ah! was 
there not grief? And even this would have been denied 
them, had they shown it before this savage monster.</p>
        <p>I will not pain my readers with further details of my 
master's cruelty; but will give them a few of the 
monster's laws. They were as follows: In the morning, half 
an hour before daylight, the first horn was blown, at 
which the slaves arose and prepared themselves for work. 
At daylight another horn was blown, at which they 
all started in a run for the field, with the driver after 
them, carrying their provisions for the day in buckets. 
In a few moments the overseer would make his appearance, 
and give his orders to the driver, who gave them to 
the hands. They then went to work, and worked until
<pb id="watson17" n="17"/>
such time as the driver thought proper, when he would
crack his whip two or three times, and they would eat
their breakfasts, which consisted of strong, rancid pork,
coarse corn bread, and water, which was brought to them
by small children, who were not able to handle the hoe.
As soon as Harry, the driver, has finished his breakfast,
they finish likewise, and hang up their buckets on the
fence or trees, and to work they go, without one moment's
intermission until noon, when they take their dinner in
the same manner as their breakfast; which done, they go
again to work, continuing till dark. They then return to
their cabins, and have a half hour to prepare their food
for the next day, when the horn is again blown for bed.
If any are found out of their cabins after this time, they
are put in jail and kept till morning, when they 
generally receive twenty-five or thirty lashes for their 
misdemeanor. So it continues through the week until 
Sunday, when the women take their tubs and blankets and
start for the brooks, where they dismantle and robe
themselves in their blanket, wash and dry their clothes,
put them on again, and are ready to be at the house at
four o'clock to receive their weekly allowance, which is
weighed out to them by the overseer. The men give
their shirts to the women to wash, and take their baskets
or hoes and start for the field. The are generally paid
for this extra work; if they do not work, they are set 
down as lazy persons, and are whipped because they will
not work for themselves. Thus is the Sabbath passed.
That day of rest and prayer is as other days to the poor
slave. For six years whilst I was on this farm, there was
never such a thing as a slave going to meeting, or 
hearing the word of God in any form.</p>
        <pb id="watson18" n="18"/>
        <p>Much has been said about the marriage rites of
slaves; but there exists no legal form,—every slaveholder 
having a form of his own. Permit me, then, to give
to my readers the manner in which my master performed 
the ceremony. Whenever a vacancy occurred in any of
the cabins of either sex, of marriageable age, it was 
immediately filled up by my master purchasing another
slave, either man or woman, as the case might be, and
presenting them to the remaining inmates of the cabin,
with the following words: “Kitty, stand out in the floor;
I have bought this boy to-day for your husband, and I 
shall expect you to take good care of him, by washing 
and mending his clothes. You know my orders to the 
overseer; if either of you go to the field on Monday 
morning without your clothes being washed, you are to be 
whipped. You will also take care of his provisions, which 
will be weighed out with yours. Have it cooked and 
ready in his bucket in time for him to go to the field 
every morning. You understand what I have said to 
you;” which the slave must answer with a low bow, and 
replying, “I do, sir.” Then he will give the man the
following charge: “Tom, you will take care of this girl 
for your wife, by bringing her wood, making her fire, 
bringing water. Should your wife or self want anything, 
you can get it by working on Sunday, for which I will 
allow you fifty cents a day, out of the store.” He would 
then ask them both if they understood his orders. They 
would answer as before, by a low bow and courtesy, 
replying that they did. He would then pronounce them 
man and wife, and say to them, “If you fail to perform 
any of the duties I have mentioned, you will be flogged 
severely.”</p>
        <pb id="watson19" n="19"/>
        <p>To give a sketch of all the cruelties that I witnessed
on Mr. McNeill's place, would occupy more space
in this little book than I desire. I will give a 
description of the manner in which the dead slaves are
disposed of. On the death of a slave, I was sent by
my master to the overseer, requesting him to send
two boys to the house. On their arrival, he would
order them to the hospital, or sick-house, as it is generally 
called, and they would take the body, fasten it in
the blanket on which he died, put it on the hand-barrow,
and carry it to its place of burial. This was generally
done very hastily, on account of the climate. Thus are
they bundled into the earth, without minister or coffin, or
permitting the husband, or wife, or mother, to see the
last disposal of that which has been dear to them on
earth.</p>
        <p>I was on this farm about six years, five of which I 
was employed as house servant; and it is probable that 
I should have remained in the house, had I not refused 
to give him some information respecting a pig, which two 
of the men had stolen. This disobedience caused me 
much suffering. In the first place, I was severely whipped 
with a cowskin, the scars of which punishment I have 
to this day, and then I was sent to the field to work,—
the place I dreaded mostly. From morning till night 
could the whip be heard, accompanied with the cries and 
groans of the sufferers, whilst I was employed at the 
house. I was not under the direction of the cruel 
overseer, and consequently escaped his cruelty. A day 
seldom passed without witnessing several hundred lashes 
inflicted upon the slaves; each individual having a stated 
number of pounds of cotton to pick, the deficit of which
<pb id="watson20" n="20"/>
was made up by as many lashes being applied to the
poor slave's back as he was so unlucky as to fall short
in the number of pounds of cotton which he was to have
picked.</p>
        <p>As I had not been accustomed to field-work, I found
it impossible to keep up with the others. The overseer, 
seeing this, came up to me and asked me if I knew 
where I was; I said, I did; he then replied, that I had 
been at the house so long that I had got the devil in me; 
and if I did not keep my row up with the rest, he would 
give me a hundred lashes, and that d—d quick. To
this I did not reply, but toiled on to the best of my 
knowledge, hoping to escape punishment; but all in vain; 
frequently was I whipped without any just cause. I do 
now think that he made me his particular victim on 
account of my having been out of his power so long a 
time. I am incapable of describing the great difference 
between house and field labor. I have, since my settling 
in the North, heard many persons, in speaking of slavery 
as they have seen it in cities, towns, &amp;c., where it exists 
in its mildest form, apologizing for it, holding it forth 
to the world as a great benefit to the black man. They 
say the slaves are nicely fed, clothed, and taken care of 
in a very comfortable manner. But, step back in the 
interior of slave States, on the plantations, where you 
see one hundred slaves in charge of a drunken overseer; 
thinly clad, and scantily fed; driven forth to labor from
daylight till dark; where a slave for the most trivial
offence may be whipped to death, for in case of death
arising from whipping the overseer is indifferent,—he
knows the master cannot use the word of his slave against
him,—he will not acknowledge it himself. Thus there
<pb id="watson21" n="21"/>
is nothing to restrain him from using the most unnatural
and inhuman cruelty to the poor slaves.</p>
        <p>Towards the end of the year that I was in the field,
my suffering increased to that degree that it caused me 
to lift my voice to Almighty God, and pray fervently for
a termination of my sufferings in death; though, at that
time, I was ignorant of the blessings of religion. I have
thought that the God of the oppressed heard my prayer 
and came to my relief, by changing my situation, under
the following circumstances. About that time, his
younger brother, William, visited the farm, with his wife,
and had been at the house some two or three weeks 
before I saw him. A few days before he left I was sent
for to come to the house, by the servant whom my 
master had bought to take my place when I was put in the
field. On my approaching the house, I observed my
master, his brother, and wife, standing in the door
looking at me. Mr. William McNeill spoke to me, and
told me that he had bought me. He then ordered me
into the kitchen to wash, and sent me out a pair of 
pantaloons and a shirt, in which I appeared much better
than in the ragged covering which I had cast off. I was
then sent to the house, and there he made me acquainted
with my duties as a body servant, which, as they were
similar to those of my former master, it would be useless
to describe. As I was delighted with this change, and
there was something so pleasing in the manner of my
new master, so different from that of my old one, I 
entered into my duties with pleasure. In a few days I
started with my master and mistress for Louisiana to visit
her father's plantation, who was a sugar planter, and a
more cruel one I do not think was to be found in that
<pb id="watson22" n="22"/>
neighborhood. We remained a few weeks there, when 
my master made arrangements to visit Kentucky, leaving 
his wife behind. We went up the Mississippi as far as
Memphis, there leaving the boat and taking the stage 
for Nashville, Tennessee; and from thence to Lexington, 
Kentucky. A few days after our arrival, my master 
made me acquainted with the object of his visit, which 
was to purchase slaves, intending to take them to Mississippi,
where he was going to farming; and he instructed 
me to tell all slaves who should inquire of me if he was 
a good master, that he was, to which I readily assented; 
and, as he did not wish to purchase any that were not 
willing to go with him, he would frequently send them to 
me, and I gave them satisfactory proofs of his kindness. 
He soon got a sufficient number, and started for the 
Mississippi by land. They all started willingly on their 
journey, and arrived at its end without any difficulty. 
This to be wondered at, as none of the gang were 
ironed or shackled in any way.</p>
        <p>My master had purchased a farm about one hundred 
and eighty miles from his brother's, my former master; 
at which we arrived, as I before stated, without any 
difficulty. My master remained on the farm until everything 
was put in order, when he gave the farm up to the overseer, 
and started for his wife, whom he had not seen for 
six months. When we arrived at her father's plantation, 
I was kindly received by my mistress, and I had begun 
to hope that master and mistress were both kind people.
But I was soon disappointed; for my mistress had been
brought up in Louisiana, and had witnessed punishment
all her life, and had become hardened to it. On the
other hand, my master had spent a number of years in
<pb id="watson23" n="23"/>
the State of York, completing his education, and was
unused to such cruelty as yet. As soon as everything
was arranged we started for home, which we reached
without accident. My mistress had two favorite slaves;
an old nurse about sixty years of age, and a maid-servant
about fifteen. On our arrival, we were installed in our
new offices: the nurse was to cook; the girl was to 
attend to the light duty of the house; I was to take care
of the horse and carriage, chop wood, and, any out-door
work about the yard. For the first month or two, everything
went on quite smoothly; but soon the cloud grew
black, the storm commenced. My mistress had suppressed
the evil passions reigning within her as long as she was
able; but her temper soon burst forth in all its fury. I
had frequently spoken in terms of praise to the cook, of my
mistress; but she always replied, that I was not acquainted 
with her yet. I soon perceived a change in the 
management of the household affairs. Her first act was to
procure a cowhide, which was kept near for immediate
use; and there was scarcely a day but some one of us
felt it administered by her own hand upon our backs. I
have seen her beat the old cook most shockingly; at one
time she pushed her into the fire, and burnt her head
very badly. This was the kindness to the person who
had nursed her. Although I have seen her perpetrate
some of the most cruel acts that a human being could,
yet I never saw her in a passion when she was inflicting
punishment. She seemed to take delight in torturing,—
in fact, she made it a pastime; she inspired every one 
about her with terror. As for myself, I was perfectly
terrified when she approached. I never saw, and never 
expect to see another person that I feared so much as I did 
<pb id="watson24" n="24"/>
that woman. She soon exerted her wicked influence over 
her husband, who was turned into a mere automaton, moving 
at her will; and he became through her a most cruel 
man, lashing and goading the slaves as she bid him. For 
the first few months my duties were as I have mentioned; 
but soon they were increased. I had, for one thing more, 
to tend the dinner-table every day, and fan my mistress 
during her stay at the table. I have designed the cut
below to represent this scene, more clearly than I am 
able in words. After the dinner, my mistress retired to
the back piazza, to which place I had to accompany her, 
where there was a net hung for her amusement. She 
would generally lie down in it for an hour or so, and I 
had there to resume my fanning, as at dinner. When 
this was through, I had to bring the carriage to the door
for her to take an airing in. She would ride four or
five miles out and back before tea. I would then take 
care of my horse and carriage, and my duties were 
generally over for the day. </p>
        <p>Thus passed about a year of my time with Mr. 
<pb id="watson25" n="25"/>
William McNeill; when, thinking that the service of a 
field-hand would be of more value to him, he made up his 
mind to part with me. He had promised, when he bought 
me, that he would never put me in the field to work. He 
asked me, if I thought I could get a master? I told him, 
I thought I could. He accordingly gave me a pass to 
go to Vicksburg, which is one hundred miles from my 
master's farm. There I was well acquainted, and thought 
I could get a master without any difficulty. I remained 
there two or three days looking for a master, but was 
unsuccessful. It then occurred to me that I would go 
to another town, about thirty miles from Vicksburg, where 
a gentleman lived who had often spoken of me in flattering 
terms. I accordingly started, and reached there in 
safety, and called on the gentleman, and presented the 
letter which my master had given me. After reading it 
and asking a few questions, he sent me into the kitchen. 
He then went across the street to a house where there 
was a drove of slaves for sale, and selected one and
brought him over to me, and asked me, if I thought he
would do? I told him, I thought he would. He placed 
him in charge of the stage-driver the next morning, for
Mr. McNeill's farm. Thus ended my services with one 
of the worst masters on the Mississippi. </p>
        <p>I entered the duties of my new situation with pleasure; 
not that I saw anything more pleasing in my new master
than I did in Mr. McNeill, but the thought of having
left the farm, as I hoped, forever, was a source of great
consolation to me. I do not mention the name of this
gentleman or of any of my subsequent masters, as I do
not wish to afford them the means to trace me. I resolved,
when I commenced my new services, that I would do
<pb id="watson26" n="26"/>
everything in my power to please my master, so that he 
would have no occasion to sell me; and I soon ascertained 
to my satisfaction that my efforts were not unsuccessful, 
for he entrusted me with the keys of his house,—he not 
being a married man,—which is the highest mark of 
confidence a slave enjoys. I had been with him but a short 
time, when I learned that he was training us for a hotel, 
which he intended opening in a neighboring city. This
information pleased me much; for I thought the larger
the city I was in, the smaller the chance would be of my
getting on a farm. When the hotel was ready, he started
with his servants. We reached there in safety, and went
immediately to the hotel, where we each entered upon
the duties assigned us; mine was in the dining-room, as
waiter, a situation not very desirable on account of not
being able to make as much money from boarders as in
other stations in this house. In this situation I soon
learned to gamble, in order to gain money from those
who had the chance of making more than I made. In
this wicked business I was very expert, and had
constantly on hand a small stock of money. Slavery has
made labor dishonorable to the white man; and, as they
must have means of living, they generally resort to
gambling for support, and as they cannot always find their
own color to rob, they fasten upon the poor, degraded
slave, who has received some little trifle for an extra piece
of labor to gull from him that which he has paid so
dearly for; and I have spent many Sunday nights, after
my work was done, gambling. But, as about this time
there arose a great excitement respecting gamblers, and
having seen, in the city of Vicksburg, five gamblers hung,
it rather tended to stop my nefarious business for awhile.
<pb id="watson27" n="27"/>
The citizens, being determined to put a final stop to the
practice, searched among the slaves to punish them
for what they had learned from their white brothers.
They accordingly had about one hundred up for examination,
which was carried on very closely; and they came to
the conclusion, that a free colored man and myself
were the principals. We were brought before the court,
which was held in the bar-room at the hotel where I
was employed. The court seemed to have some sympathy
for the free man. He was sentenced first to have
his left ear cropped, to be tarred and feathered and put
in a boat full of holes, and set adrift down the river.
They appointed a committee to see it put into effect, and
they then proceeded to sentence me. There was some
disagreement respecting what my sentence should be.
Some wanted me branded,—others hung; but they at last
agreed that I should have sixty lashes, to be received at
the public whipping-post, and my master to give bonds
for me to keep the peace. So great was the excitement,
that for three weeks the city was kept under martial
law. After I had got over my flogging, I resolved never
to gamble again.</p>
        <p>Very shortly after this, a circumstance occurred at
the coffee-house, which I have seen noticed in print; but,
as I was acquainted with the parties, and as some of my
readers may not have read it, I will relate it. There was
an old slave attached to the house, by the name Jim,
who was summoned one day to a room where there was
two young slaveholders present. He had scarcely answered
their call before he dropped down, in a fit of
apoplexy. “He is dead!” exclaimed one. “He'll come
to,” replied the other. “Dead, for five hundred!”
<pb id="watson28" n="28"/>
“Done!” retorted the other. The noise of the fall and
the confusion which followed, brought up to the owner, who
called for a doctor. “No! no! we must have no interference;
there's a bet depending!” “But, Sir, I shall
lose a valuable servant.” “Never mind; you can put
him down in the bill!” was their reply. The poor fellow,
after suffering some length of time, finally came to. I
merely state this fact, as I could many others, to show
the passion for gaming the Southerners have, and the
brutish manner in which a slave is treated.</p>
        <p>Two years of my life passed away without any particular
interruption, when, one Sunday afternoon, I got
into a dispute with another slave. High words were
followed by blows; when I got exasperated, having
drank freely of liquor, and stabbed him. I was immediately
arrested and put in jail and kept till morning,
when I was examined in court. My master, in the
meantime, had engaged the services of a distinguished
lawyer by the name of S.S. Prentiss, who by his able
arguments extricated me from punishment by law; but
recommended my master to flog me, which he followed
to the letter. The slave with whom I had the difficulty
was not injured so as to cause death, and eventually
recovered.</p>
        <p>I had never been to a meeting of a religious nature
since I had been in the city; but, soon after the difficulty
I have just mentioned, my master changed the
hour for dinner, which enabled us to go to church.
There was a Methodist meeting-house on the hill near
the jail to which our master allowed us all to go every
Sunday afternoon, as we could not go in the forenoon,
where we heard the word of the minister preached to us,
<pb id="watson29" n="29"/>
who was a white man; the law making it necessary that
white persons should be present at all assemblages of
slaves or free negroes. The object of all the slaveholders
in having their slaves go to church can be clearly seen
by the following sermon, which, or one very similar to it,
I recollect hearing while worshipping at this church,
which has been published and circulated quite extensively
at the South:—“ ‘All things whatsoever ye would
that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them:’
That is, do by all mankind just as you would desire they
should do by you if you were in their place, and they
in yours. Now, to suit this rule to your particular
circumstances: suppose you were masters and mistresses,
and had servants under you; would you not
desire that your servants should do their business faithfully
and honestly, as well when your back was turned
as while you were looking over them? Would you
not expect that they should take notice of what you said
to them; that they should behave themselves with respect
towards you and yours; and be as careful of everything
belonging to you, as you would be yourself? You are
servants; do, therefore, as you wish to be done by,
and you will be both good servants to your masters and
to your God, who requires this of you, and will reward
you well for it, if you do it for the sake of conscience,
in obedience to his commands. Take care that you do
not fret, or murmur, or grumble at your condition, for
this will not only make your life uneasy, but will greatly
offend Almighty God. Consider, this it is not yourselves;
it is not the people you belong to; it is not the men
that have brought you to it; but it is the will of God, who
hath by wise providence made you servants, because,
<pb id="watson30" n="30"/>
no doubt, he knew that condition would be best for you
in this world and help you the better toward heaven,
if you would but do your duty in it; so that any discontent
at your not being free, or rich, or great as some
others, is quarrelling with your Heavenly Master, and
finding fault with God himself. There is only one circumstance
which may appear grievous; that I shall now take
notice of,—and that is, correction. Now, let us see what
the Scriptures say on this point. ‘The servant that
knoweth his master's will and doeth it not, shall be
beaten with many stripes.’ Now, does this not apply
directly to yourselves? Now, when correction is given
to you, you either deserve it, or you do not deserve it;
but, whether you really deserve it or not, it is your duty,
and Almighty God requires, that you bear it patiently.
You may perhaps think that this is hard doctrine; but if
you consider right, you must needs think otherwise of it.
Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot
but say that it is right and just you should meet with it.
Suppose, then, that you deserve correction, you cannot
but say that it is right and just you should meet with it.
Suppose you do not deserve it, or at least do not deserve
so much punishment for the fault you have committed,
you perhaps have escaped a great many more, and are
at last paid for all. Or, suppose you are quite innocent
of what is laid to your charge, and suffer wrongfully in
that particular thing; is it not possible you may have
done some other bad thing, which was never discovered,
and that Almighty God, who saw you doing it, would not
let you escape without punishment some time or another?
and ought you not in such a case to give glory to him,
and be thankful that he would rather punish you in this
world for your wickedness than destroy your souls for it
in the next? But, suppose that this even was not the
<pb id="watson31" n="31"/>
case,—a case hardly to be imagined; and that you have
by no means, known or unknown, deserved the correction
you have received, there is this great comfort
in it, that if you bear it patiently and leave your cause
in your hands of God, he will reward you for it in heaven;
and this punishment you suffer unjustly here, shall turn
to your exceeding great glory hereafter.”</p>
        <p>Such, my readers, is the doctrine which is preached
to the poor slave; and I could add many more specimens
of it, if space would permit. They are made to believe
that God made them slaves, that they are always to
remain slaves, and bear with patience and humility the
unjust punishment they receive on earth, that it may be
to their glory hereafter. Is it not an unpardonable sin
for man thus to defile the holy sanctuary, and pollute
the sacred word of God by using it for such base purposes?
But comment is unnecessary; the diabolical
facts show fairly enough of themselves, without my
attempting to bring them out any more. The cut represents
a number of slaves listening to preaching of this
kind.</p>
        <pb id="watson32" n="32"/>
        <p>I remained at this place about four years, when I was
hired out to a genteel sportsman, whom I was with for
nine months, and in that time I travelled a great deal with
him, and witnessed much of the sufferings of my
brothers and sisters in bondage. But, from having
seen so much, my heart began to grow less feeling for
the sufferings of others, and even indifferent to my own
punishment. My time having expired, I was sent back
to my master. In travelling with this man, whose name
I will not mention, I had cherished the idea of being my
own master; but, returning to the State of Mississippi,
my hopes left me for awhile, for it is almost a matter of
impossibility for a slave to escape, on account of its situation;
and added to that, there are men who do nothing
else but hunt fugitive slaves with hounds that are so well
trained, that they do, as they advertise, take slaves
without scarring them enough to injure their value. I
have said, my hope for freedom had left me. I am
wrong; it was suppressed, for I had determined to be free
whenever an opportunity should present itself. I had to
be extremely careful in my deportment, more attentive
if possible to my duty, so that there should be no suspicion
that I had made up my mind to run away; for the
slaveholder watches every movement of the slave, and
if he is downcast or sad,—in fact, if they are in any mood
but laughing and singing, and manifesting symptoms of
perfect content at heart,—they are said to have the devil
in them, which is the common term; and they are often
whipped or sold for their supposed wicked intentions.
But as for myself, the more I reflected upon my situation,
the more cheerful I appeared to be. About this
<pb id="watson33" n="33"/>
time a change came over my master's affairs, which
caused me to be transferred into another's hands, which
change I afterwards found to be of great benefit to me.
To my great joy and satisfaction, I soon left this town;
for I had made up my mind that it was one of the most
wicked places that I had ever been in. We arrived at
our place of destination without accident. I served this
man as body-servant for some time, when, being known
as a good waiter, I was hired out to the proprietor of a
large hotel. In this situation I was endeavoring to
gain all the information I could respecting the northern
States, and the means of escape; but I could not obtain
much satisfaction on this point, as white persons visiting
the hotels are very careful what they say in the
presence of the slaves. About six months after I had
been at the hotel, there came a gentleman from the
North, who seemed to manifest a great deal of sympathy
for my situation, and who afterwards proved to be my
deliverer from bondage, whose name I can give, if called
for. He lives in the city of Boston. Yes, through him
I am enabled to sit this minute at my own table, and also
to worship God according to the dictates of my own conscience,
and pray fervently for the great day of universal
emancipation; when the husband may return to his wife;
the child to the mother; when the clanking of chains,
the crack of the whip, the cries of the bleeding bondmen,
shall no more ascend to heaven.</p>
        <p>But I am wandering from the subject of my escape.
One day, this gentleman, my deliverer, who had become
quite well acquainted with me, overheard some remarks
of mine, which caused him to ask me the following questions:
first, “Are you a slave?” to which I replied,
<pb id="watson34" n="34"/>
I was. He said, that he had all along thought me to be
a free man. He then asked, who my master was?
I told him. “Why don't you run away?” said he. I
told him, with a laugh, I knew not where to go. At
this moment, the bell which called me to my duty, rang,
and I had to leave him; but with the determination to
renew the conversation at the earliest opportunity, for
it was what I had been long looking for,—a friend to
consult with on the subject of freedom. The same night
I had another opportunity to converse with him; and,
finding that I was determined to escape, he informed me
of the security the northern states afforded for slaves,
the feeling of the free people of color living there, and
of the great anti-slavery movement there, a subject
which I was entirely ignorant of before; and he then
offered me the means of escape. He told me that there
was a ship lying at the wharf, that would soon sail for the
North, and that he was acquainted with some persons on
board, whom he could get to interfere in my behalf. I
had hoped that he would be able to make all arrangements
without my going on board, but I was disappointed;
for he told me that at twelve o'clock the same day, in case 
of not seeing him before that time, to go on board,
and inquire for the captain; on seeing him, to make my
bow to him, to look up unabashed, and ask him for a
passage. He will ask you, where your home is? You
must tell him, in Boston; for I have told you so much
about it, that you can give him the information he will
ask for. I told him, I thought I could. Should he
ask you were in Boston you live, you may tell him at
the North End. Should he ask you what street in Boston
you live, tell him, in Ann street. Should he ask
<pb id="watson35" n="35"/>
you, how Ann street runs, tell him, it runs parallel with
Commercial street; saying this, turn away with a laugh
from the captain, telling him he needs no information
about the streets of Boston, as he knows as well as you
do of these situations. These questions he made me answer
to him many times; and fortunate for me that he
did, for I found them of great value to me. He then
left me, charging me to go on board precisely at twelve
o'clock, if I did not see him before that time. I spent
all the rest of the morning in repeating my simple, but
important catechism,—quite as much so to me in my
situation as ever the famous Shorter Catechism, of
Westminster Assembly notoriety, was to a youngster just
receiving his first theological lesson from the lips of a
Presbyterian parent, anxious to save the soul of his child; well
will it be for all who repeat that important religious catechism,
if it renders them as effectual service, in saving
their souls, as mine did in saving my body and soul from
slavery's cursed hell,—and thinking of the hour, waiting
with impatience its approach, and yet dreading its coming;
for I had seen so many slaves brought back, and
witnessed the dreadful punishment they have received
for attempting to get their freedom, that I shuddered at
the consequence of detection. The hour at last arrived.
My friends had not returned, and I started for the ship;
but, as I came in sight of it, my courage forsook me. I
feared that I should not be able to appear manly
and fearless. Had I not been bought under the lash of the
white man? had not everything of a manly nature been
beaten out of me? had I not been taught that I was a
slave,—that I was ever to remain a slave? that it
was the wish of Almighty God that I should be content
<pb id="watson36" n="36"/>
with my situation? But my readers will excuse me for
deviating from my narration to excuse the cowardly feelings
which then induced me to turn back. But as I did
so, I paused for a moment; and the thought of freedom—
delicious freedom—came rushing over me, and filled my
soul with pleasure, and I determined to persevere.
Conning over my catechism again, I retraced my steps
for the ships; and as it again came to my view, I felt
like a new man, and that I would attempt it if it cost
me my life. I went on board with a firm step, and
inquired for the captain. I was shown him, and about
the same questions were asked me that my kind friend
had prepared me to answer. About the close of our
interview the idea came to me, that, should he ask me
for my free papers, what could I say,—what should I do?
for I had none; and these thoughts came very near
making me forget how to answer my last question, which was
the situation of Ann street. I however answered
as I had been instructed, and took a step or two forward.
On returning, I met the steward, who had just come
out of the cabin, whom I had never seen before; and to
my surprise he came up and addressed me in a manner
that would indicate his having known me from boyhood,
and asked me when I had heard from, and when I was
going home? I told him, that I had just applied to the
captain for a passage. At this, he turned to the captain,
and told him that he should want some assistance of his,
he would like to have me go with him. The captain,
seeing the supposed familiarity that was between us,
replied that he would take me for half price, which was
fifteen dollars. This was another blow, which I did not
<pb id="watson37" n="37"/>
know how to avert; but the kind steward, seeing the
dilemma that I was in, kindly offered to become responsible
for the money. Oh! how joyful I then felt. I was
lighter in body and mind, as if some crushing weight
had been lifted from my shoulders. I left the ship and
ran home, half crying and laughing, to think the day of
my liberty was so near at hand. I reached the hotel in
a state of mind impossible to describe. I however saw
the necessity of suppressing my extraordinary joy, so
that it would not be observed and lead to questioning me.
I accordingly went to work concealing my thoughts,
and looked eagerly for the day that the ship was to sail;
for the captain had informed me when he would be ready
to leave.</p>
        <p>The day at length arrived for the sailing of the ship;
and one hour before she sailed I went on board, with
the clothes I was at work in, not daring to take a thing
with me, although I had plenty at the hotel, for fear that
it would excite suspicion. I stood upon the deck looking
at every person about me, thinking that the excuse
I could give if interrogated there would be more
plausible than if I were in the cabin or any other
part of the ship. Finally, the steamboat which was to take
us down the river came up alongside and was made fast.
As this was going on I ventured to turn my head, and
on the boat saw a man, whom I thought I had seen at the
hotel. The thought came to me, should he see me, he
might inform my master. I immediately feigned sickness,
and stooped down over the rail of the vessel and
made a piteous moaning, which attracted the attention of
the captain, who ordered the steward to come to my relief.
He came and assisted me down between decks.
<pb id="watson38" n="38"/>
and laid me upon some old sails and ropes, telling me to
remain there until he called me. In a short time he came
and brought a glass half full of brandy, thick with cayenne
pepper, for me to drink. I drank it, and for some
minutes it made me think that I was all on fire within.
This was to avoid suspicion. The steamer took us down
the Mississippi, passed the city of New Orleans, and left
us at the outside the Balize, at which time I had not
appeared on deck, nor did I until the boat had left the
ship and she had set her sails for sea; then I left my
hiding-place, with my hands on my stomach. The captain
then came up to me, and looking for me full in the face,
asked me, if I had got well? I told him, I was better.
He said that I had better do some light work, and it
would probably wear off. I then busied myself about
the ship, endeavoring to make myself as useful as I could.
We had a pleasant passage of twenty-nine days and
arrived in Boston without anything special happening. I
have taken care to suppress the captain's name, and the
name of his ship, knowing that should it be known it
would cause him difficulty; and I never have given
either since I have been a free man. The money which
the steward paid for my passage I was able to refund to
him in about a year afterwards.</p>
        <p>Thus twenty-six years, the prime of my life, had passed
away in slavery, I having witnessed it in all its forms;
and I can say with safety say, there is no good in it;
and I can never hear any person apologizing for it without
pronouncing them to be meddling with that they know
nothing of. I remained concealed for three weeks in
the house of Mr. Wright, fearing to trust myself with
any one, not knowing who was my friend. But, finding
<pb id="watson39" n="39"/>
myself destitute, I at length ventured out, and my case
became known among the people of color. I was directed
to that friend and champion of the slave, William L.
Garrison, who ever stands ready to assist and advise the
panting fugitive. To him I told my history; and, after
giving me pecuniary assistance, he advised me to leave
the country and go to Canada, or England. As I considered
his advice wholesale, I determined to follow it;
and left the office in company with Mr. Nell, a gentleman
of color, who had accompanied me there, and who
is since deceased. As I proceeded down street, we met
a gentleman whom Mr. Nell knew. This gentleman was
inquiring for some one to work for him on board a vessel.
I was introduced to him and accepted his proposals, and
stayed with him a sufficient time to accumulate enough
to leave the land of Bibles and whips, where there is no
place for the fugitive to rest his weary feet. But, in justice
to my late employer, the Hon. Josiah Sturgis,
who I found to be my best friend, I would state, that he
is a man possessed of a noble and generous heart; and
that he is ever ready to assist the destitute who apply
to him.</p>
        <p>Once more I set sail for the land of freeman; and
when I touched the soil of Britain, I felt that I was
safe,—that I then was, in reality, free. On my passage
out, there was a gentleman by the name of Hodges
on board, who, having found that I was going to leave
the ship, he hired me to travel with him. I accordingly
entered into his service, and travelled over a large portion
of England with him; and wherever I went, I was
treated like a man. They looked at the color of my
skin, but judged me from my internal qualifications.</p>
        <pb id="watson40" n="40"/>
        <p>But, as I have been more lengthy in this Narrative
than I intended, I will bring it to a close; sincerely,
hoping that it will interest my readers, and tend to
ameliorate the condition of my three millions of brothers
and sisters in bondage, as well as throw some light upon
the condition of the slaves in Mississippi; the narratives
of other fugitives having for their scenes other States.
After remaining a few months in England, I judged it
best for me to return to America, which I accordingly did.</p>
        <p>This Narrative by no means covers the whole ground
of my experience under slavery's iron protection; for I
could easily fill a much larger space than this with
accounts of what I have seen and felt of the kindly influences
of that patriarchal institution, standing as it does
(as McDuffie has well said) “at the corner stone of
our republican edifice.” Perhaps, hereafter, I may furnish
some more facts respecting its heavenly character.</p>
        <p>Before closing this little Narrative by the request of a
number of friends, I will state some facts in relation to
the escape of my wife.</p>
        <p>She was a slave, in Maryland: was born about
one hundred miles from Baltimore: Her mother was liberated
at the death of her master, and left five children in
slavery, including my wife. Her mother removed to the
North, where she had six other children. She is now
dead, and the family are scattered. My wife remained
at her birth-place until she was old enough to be hired
out, then was taken to Baltimore and put to work.
There she remained until she made her escape I will not
repeat, lest I should block up the way, or affect the business
of the under-ground railroad.</p>
        <pb id="watson41" n="41"/>
        <p>As she lived in a State where slavery subsisted in its
mildest form, her experience in it was far different from
many. She knew nothing comparatively of the grossest
form of it; but notwithstanding this she cordially detests
slavery, and is an earnest anti-slavery worker.</p>
        <p>When toil worn and care worn, when well-nigh disheartened
from all this care and toil, I have invariably
been sustained by the sympathy and kind words of my
wife. Truly, in the language of Scripture, she is “an
ever present help in time of need.” When, saddened in
spirit by a reflection that my brethren are still groaning
in bondage, I have found—from her former situation as
a slave, being equally a sufferer with myself—she could
enter into my feelings and cheer me with hopes of the
approaching time of their liberation.</p>
        <p>By the advice of my wife I destroyed the advertisement
of my master, thinking my safety was endangered
by it. Had it been in my possession now, I would have
given the form without the name in connection with it.</p>

        <div2 type="document">
          <head>EXTRACT FROM WELD'S AMERICAN SLAVERY
AS IT IS.</head>
          <p>IN the ‘Charleston (South Carolina) Mercury’ of October
12, 1838, we find an advertisement of half a column by a
Dr. T. Stillman, setting forth the merits of another ‘Medical
Infirmary,’ under his own special supervision, at No. 110
Church street, Charleston. The doctor, after inveighing
loudly against ‘men totally ignorant of medical services,’ who
flood the country with quack nostrums backed up by ‘fabricated
proofs of miraculous cures,’ proceeds to enumerate the disease
to which his ‘Infirmary’ is open, and to which his
practice will be mainly confined. Appreciating the importance
of ‘interesting cases,’ as a stock in trade on which
to commence his experiments, he copies the example of the
medical professors, and advertises for them. But, either
from a keener sense of justice, or more generosity, or greater
confidence in his skill, or for some other reason, he proposes
to <hi rend="italics">buy up</hi> an assortment of <hi rend="italics">damaged</hi> negroes, given over as
incurable by others, and to make such his ‘interesting cases,’
instead of experimenting on those who are the ‘property’
of others.</p>
          <p>Dr. Stillman closes his advertisement with the following
notice:—</p>
          <pb id="watson43" n="43"/>
          <p>“TO PLANTERS AND OTHERS.—<hi rend="italics">Wanted, fifty negroes.</hi>
Any person having sick negroes, considered incurable by
their respective physicians, and wishing to dispose of them,
Dr. S. will pay cash for negroes affected with scrofula or
king's evil, confirmed hypocondriasm, apoplexy, diseases of
the liver, kidneys, spleen, stomach and intestines, bladder
and its appendages, diarrhoea, dysentery, &amp;c. The highest
cash price will be paid on application as above.”</p>
          <p>The absolute barbarism of a ‘public opinion’ which not
only tolerates, but <hi rend="italics">produces</hi> such advertisements as this, was
outdone by nothing in the dark ages. If the reader has a
heart of flesh, he can feel it without help, and if he has not,
comment will not create it. The total indifference of slaveholders
to such a cold-blooded proposition, their utter unconsciousness
of the paralysis of heart, and death of sympathy,
and every feeling of common humanity, for the slave,
which it reveals, is enough of itself to show that the tendency
of the spirit of slaveholding is, to kill in the soul whatever
it touches. It has no eyes to see, nor ears to hear, nor mind
to understand, nor heart to feel for its victims as <hi rend="italics">human
beings</hi>. To show that the above indication of the savage
state is not an index of individual feeling, but of ‘public
opinion,’ it is sufficient to say, that it appears to be standing
advertisements in the Charleston Mercury, the leading political
paper of South Carolina, the organ of the Honorables John
C. Calhoun, Robert Barnwell Rhett, Hugh S. Legare, and
others regarded as the elite of her statesmen and literati.
Besides, candidates for popular favor, like the doctor who
advertises for the fifty ‘incurables,’ take special care to conciliate,
rather than outrage, ‘public opinion.’ Is the doctor so
ignorant of ‘public opinion’ in his own city, that he has unwittingly
committed violence upon it in his advertisement? We
<sic corr="know">trow</sic> not. The same ‘public opinion’ which gave birth to
<pb id="watson44" n="44"/>
the advertisement of Dr. Stillman, and to those of the
professors in both medical institutions, founded the Charleston
‘Work-House,’—a soft name for a Moloch temple
dedicated to torture, and reeking with blood in the midst of
the city; to which masters and mistresses send their
slaves of both sexes to be stripped, tied up, and cut with the
lash till the blood and mangled flesh flow to their feet, or to
be beaten and bruised with the terrible paddle, or forced to
climb the tread-mill till nature sinks, or to experience other
nameless torments.—<hi rend="italics">See Weld's American Slavery As it

          <head>EXTRACTS FROM THE AMERICAN SLAVE
CODE.</head>
          <p>THE following are mostly abridged selections from the statutes
of the slave States and of the United States. They
give but a faint view of the cruel oppression to which the
slaves are subject, but a strong one enough, it is thought, to
fill every honest heart with a deep abhorrence of the atrocious
system. Most of the important provisions here cited,
though placed under the name of only one State, prevail in
nearly all the States, with slight variations in language, and
some diversity in the penalties. The extracts have been
made in part from Stroud's Sketch of the Slave Laws, but
chiefly from the authorized editions of the statute books referred
to, found in the Philadelphia Law Library. As the compiler
has not had access to many of the later enactments of the
several States, nearly all he has cited are acts of an earlier
date than that of the present anti-slavery movement, so that their
severity cannot be ascribed to its influence.</p>
          <p>The cardinal principle of slavery, that the slave is not to
be ranked among <hi rend="italics">sentient beings</hi>, but among things—is an
article of property, a chattel personal—obtains as undoubted
law in all the slave States.</p>
          <pb id="watson47" n="47"/>
          <p>The dominion of the master is as unlimited as is that
which is tolerated by the laws of any civilized country in
relation to brute animals—to <hi rend="italics">quadrupeds</hi>; to use the words
of the civil law.</p>
          <p>Slaves cannot even contract matrimony.</p>
          <p>LOUISIANA.—A slave is one who is in the power of his
master, to whom he belongs. The master may sell him,
dispose of his person, his industry and his labor, he can do
nothing, possess nothing, nor acquire anything, but what
must belong to his master.</p>
          <p>Slaves are incapable of inheriting or transmitting property.</p>
          <p>Slaves shall always be reputed and considered real estate;
shall be subject to be mortgaged, according to the
rules prescribed by law, and they shall be seized and sold as
real estate.</p>
          <p>No owner of slaves shall hire his slaves to themselves,
under a penalty of twenty-five dollars for each offence.</p>
          <p>No slave can possess anything in his own right, or dispose
of the produce of his own industry, without the consent of
his master.</p>
          <p>No slave can be party in a civil suit, or witness in a civil
or criminal matter, against any white person.</p>
          <p>A slave's subordination to his master is susceptible of no
restriction (except in what incites to crime), and he owes to
him and all his family, respect without bounds, and absolute
obedience.</p>
          <p>Every slave found on horseback, without a written
permission from his master, shall receive twenty-five lashes.</p>
          <p>Any freeholder may seize and correct any slave found
absent from his usual place of work or residence, without
some white person, and if the slave resist or try to escape,
he may use arms, and if the slave <hi rend="italics">assault</hi> and strike him, he
may kill the slave.</p>
          <p>It is lawful to fire upon runaway negroes who are armed,
and upon those who, when pursued, refuse to surrender.</p>
          <p>No slave may buy, sell, or exchange any kind of goods,
or hold any boat, or bring up for his own use, any horses or
cattle, under a penalty of forfeiting the whole.</p>
          <p>Slaves or free colored persons are punished with <hi rend="italics">death</hi> for
wilfully burning or destroying any stack of produce or any
building.</p>
          <pb id="watson48" n="48"/>
          <p>The punishment of a slave for striking a white person,
shall be the first and second offences at the discretion of
the court, but not extending to life or limb, and for the third
offense, <hi rend="italics">death</hi>; but for grievously wounding or mutilating a
white person, <hi rend="italics">death</hi> for the first offence; provided, if the
blow or wound is given in defence of the person or <hi rend="italics">property
of his master</hi>, or the person having charge of him, he is
entirely justified.</p>
          <p>A slave for wilfully striking his master or mistress, or
the child of either, or his white overseer, so as to cause a
bruise or shedding of blood, <hi rend="italics">shall be punished with death</hi>.</p>
          <p>Any person cutting or breaking any iron chain or collar
used to prevent the escape of slaves, shall be fined not less
than two hundred dollars, nor more than one thousand
dollars, and be imprisoned for not more than two years, nor less
than six months.</p>
          <p>All slaves sentenced to death or perpetual imprisonment,
in virtue of existing laws, shall be paid for out of the public
treasury, provided the sum paid shall not exceed three hundred
dollars for each slave.</p>
          <p>The State Treasurer shall pay the owners the value of all
slaves whose punishment has been commuted from that of
death to that of imprisonment for life.</p>
          <p>If any slave shall <hi rend="italics">happen</hi> to be slain for refusing to surrender
him or herself, contrary to law, or in unlawfully
resisting any officer, or <hi rend="italics">other person</hi> , who shall apprehend,
or endeavor to apprehend, such slave or slaves, &amp;c., such
officer or <hi rend="italics">other person so killing such slave as aforesaid,</hi>
making resistance, shall be, and he is by this act, <hi rend="italics">indemnified</hi>,
from any prosecution for such killing aforesaid, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>And by the negro act of 1740, of South Carolina, it is declared:</p>
          <p>If any slave who shall be out of the house or plantation
where such slave shall live, or shall be usually employed, or
without some white person in company with such slave, shall
<hi rend="italics">refuse to submit</hi> to undergo the examination of <hi rend="italics">any white</hi>
person, it shall be lawful for such white person to pursue,
apprehend, and moderately correct such slave; and if such
slave shall assault and strike such white person, such slave
may be <hi rend="italics">lawfully killed!!</hi></p>
