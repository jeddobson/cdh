        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>I HAVE been asked many times by my friends, 
and also by members of the Grand Army of the 
Republic and Women's Relief Corps, to write a 
book of my army life, during the war of 1861-65, 
with the regiment of the 1st South Carolina 
Colored Troops, later called 33d United States 
Colored Infantry.</p>
        <p>At first I did not think I would, but as the 
years rolled on and my friends were still urging 
me to start with it, I wrote to Colonel C. T. 
Trowbridge (who had command of this 
regiment), asking his opinion and advice on the 
matter. His answer to me was, “Go ahead! write 
it; that is just what I should do, were I in your 
place, and I will give you all the assistance you 
may need, whenever you require it.” This 
inspired me very much.</p>
        <p>In 1900 I received a letter from a gentleman, 
sent from the Executive Mansion at St. Paul, 
Minn., saying Colonel Trowbridge had told him 
I was about to write a book, and when it was
<pb id="taylorvi" n="vi"/>
published he wanted one of the first copies. 
This, coming from a total stranger, gave me more 
confidence, so I now present these reminiscences 
to you, hoping they may prove of some interest, 
and show how much service and good we can do 
to each other, and what sacrifices we can make 
for our liberty and rights, and that there were 
“loyal women,“ as well as men, in those days, 
who did not fear shell or shot, who cared for the 
sick and dying; women who camped and fared 
as the boys did, and who are still caring for the 
comrades in their declining years.</p>
        <p>So, with the hope that the following pages will 
accomplish some good and instruction for its 
readers, I shall proceed with my narrative.</p>

        <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
        <p>ACTUAL military life is rarely described by a 
woman, and this is especially true of a woman 
whose place was in the ranks, as the wife of a 
soldier and herself a regimental laundress. No 
such description has ever been given, I am sure, 
by one thus connected with a colored regiment; 
so that the nearly 200,000 black soldiers 
(178,975) of our Civil War have never before been 
delineated from the woman's point of view. All 
this gives peculiar interest to this little volume,
relating wholly to the career of the very earliest
of these regiments,—the one described by 
myself, from a wholly different point of view, in
my volume“Army Life in a Black Regiment,”
long since translated into French by the 
Comtesse de Gasparin under the title “<foreign lang="fre">Vie Militaire
dans un Régiment Noir</foreign>.”</p>
        <p>The writer of the present book was very exceptional 
among the colored laundresses, in that she 
could read and write and had taught children to 
do the same; and her whole life and career were
<pb id="taylorxii" n="xii"/>
most estimable, both during the war and in the 
later period during which she has lived in Boston 
and has made many friends. I may add that I 
did not see the book until the sheets were in 
print, and have left it wholly untouched, except 
as to a few errors in proper names. I commend 
the narrative to those who love the plain record 
of simple lives, led in stormy periods.</p>

<salute>MRS. SUSAN KING TAYLOR:</salute></opener>
        <p>DEAR MADAM,—The manuscript of the story of 
your army life reached me to-day. I have read it 
with much care and interest, and I most willingly and 
cordially indorse it as a truthful account of your 
unselfish devotion and service through more than three 
long years of war in which the 33d Regiment bore a 
conspicuous part in the great conflict for human liberty 
and the restoration of the Union. I most sincerely 
regret that through a technicality you are debarred 
from having your name placed on the roll of pensioners, 
as an Army Nurse; for among all the number of 
heroic women whom the government is now rewarding, 
I know of no one more deserving than yourself.</p>

A BRIEF SKETCH OF MY ANCESTORS</head>
          <p>MY great-great-grandmother was 120 years 
old when she died. She had seven children, and 
five of her boys were in the Revolutionary War. 
She was from Virginia, and was half Indian. 
She was so old she had to be held in the sun to 
help restore or prolong her vitality.</p>
          <p>My great-grandmother, one of her daughters, 
named Susanna, was married to Peter Simons, 
and was one hundred years old when she died, 
from a stroke of paralysis in Savannah. She 
was the mother of twenty-four children, twenty-three 
being girls. She was one of the noted 
midwives of her day. In 1820 my grandmother was 
born, and named after her grandmother, Dolly, 
and in 1833 she married Fortune Lambert Reed. 
Two children blessed their union, James and 
Hagar Ann. James died at the age of twelve 
years.</p>
          <pb id="taylor2" n="2"/>
          <p>My mother was born in 1834. She married 
Raymond Baker in 1847. Nine children were 
born to them, three dying in infancy. I was the 
first born. I was born on the Grest Farm (which 
was on an island known as Isle of Wight), 
Liberty County, about thirty-five miles from Savannah, 
Ga., on August 6, 1848, my mother being 
waitress for the Grest family. I have often been 
told by mother of the care Mrs. Grest took of 
me. She was very fond of me, and I remember 
when my brother and I were small children, and 
Mr. Grest would go away on business, Mrs. 
Grest would place us at the foot of her bed to 
sleep and keep her company. Sometimes he 
would return home earlier than he had expected 
to; then she would put us on the floor.</p>
          <p>When I was about seven years old, Mr. Grest 
allowed my grandmother to take my brother and 
me to live with her in Savannah. There were no 
railroad connections in those days between this 
place and Savannah; all travel was by 
stagecoaches. I remember, as if it were yesterday, 
the coach which ran in from Savannah, with its 
driver, whose beard nearly reached his knees. 
His name was Shakespeare, and often I would go 
to the stable where he kept his horses, on 
Barnard Street in front of the old Arsenal, just to 
look at his wonderful beard.</p>
          <p>My grandmother went every three months to 
see my mother. She would hire a wagon to carry
<pb id="taylor3" n="3"/>
bacon, tobacco, flour, molasses, and sugar. These 
she would trade with people in the neighboring 
places, for eggs, chickens, or cash, if they had it. 
These, in turn, she carried back to the city market, 
where she had a customer who sold them for 
her. The profit from these, together with laundry 
work and care of some bachelors' rooms, 
made a good living for her.</p>
          <p>The hardest blow to her was the failure of the 
Freedmen's Savings Bank in Savannah, for in 
that bank she had placed her savings, about 
three thousand dollars, the result of her hard 
labor and self-denial before the war, and which, 
by dint of shrewdness and care, she kept together 
all through the war. She felt it more keenly, 
coming as it did in her old age, when her life 
was too far spent to begin anew; but she took a 
practical view of the matter, for she said, “I will 
leave it all in God's hand. If the Yankees did 
take all our money, they freed my race; God 
will take care of us.”</p>
          <p>In 1888 she wrote me here (Boston), asking 
me to visit her, as she was getting very feeble 
and wanted to see me once before she passed 
away. I made up my mind to leave at once, but 
about the time I planned to go, in March, a fearful 
blizzard swept our country, and travel was at 
a standstill for nearly two weeks; but March 15 
I left on the first through steamer from New 
York, en route for the South, where I again saw
<pb id="taylor4" n="4"/>
my grandmother, and we felt thankful that we 
were spared to meet each other once more. This 
was the last time I saw her, for in May, 1889, 
she died.</p>

MY CHILDHOOD</head>
          <p>I WAS born under the slave law in Georgia, 
in 1848, and was brought up by my grandmother 
in Savannah. There were three of us with her, 
my younger sister and brother. My brother and 
I being the two eldest, we were sent to a friend 
of my grandmother, Mrs. Woodhouse, a widow, 
to learn to read and write. She was a free 
woman and lived on Bay Lane, between Habersham 
and Price streets, about half a mile from my 
house. We went every day about nine o'clock, 
with our books wrapped in paper to prevent the 
police or white persons from seeing them. We 
went in, one at a time, through the gate, into the 
yard to the L kitchen, which was the schoolroom. 
She had twenty-five or thirty children whom she 
taught, assisted by her daughter, Mary Jane. 
The neighbors would see us going in sometimes, 
but they supposed we were there learning trades, 
as it was the custom to give children a trade of 
some kind. After school we left the same way 
we entered, one by one, when we would go to a 
square, about a block from the school, and wait 
for each other. We would gather laurel leaves
<pb id="taylor6" n="6"/>
and pop them on our hands, on our way home. 
I remained at her school for two years or more, 
when I was sent to a Mrs. Mary Beasley, where 
I continued until May, 1860, when she told my 
grandmother she had taught me all she knew, 
and grandmother had better get some one else 
who could teach me more, so I stopped my studies 
for a while.</p>
          <p>I had a white playmate about this time, named 
Katie O'Connor, who lived on the next corner 
of the street from my house, and who attended 
a convent. One day she told me, if I would 
promise not to tell her father, she would give me 
some lessons. On my promise not to do so, and 
getting her mother's consent, she gave me lessons 
about four months, every evening. At the end 
of this time she was put into the convent 
permanently, and I have never seen her since.</p>
          <p>A month after this, James Blouis, our landlord's 
son, was attending the High School, and 
was very fond of grandmother, so she asked him 
to give me a few lessons, which he did until the 
middle of 1861, when the Savannah Volunteer 
Guards, to which he and his brother belonged, 
were ordered to the front under General Barton. 
In the first battle of Manassas, his brother 
Eugene was killed, and James deserted over to 
the Union side, and at the close of the war went 
to Washington, D. C., where he has since 
resided.</p>
          <pb id="taylor7" n="7"/>
          <p>I often wrote passes for my grandmother, for 
all colored persons, free or slaves, were 
compelled to have a pass; free colored people having 
a guardian in place of a master. These passes 
were good until 10 or 10<sic corr=":">.</sic>30 P. M. for one night 
or every night for one month. The pass read as 
follows:—</p>
          <q type="letter" direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">

                    <dateline>SAVANNAH, GA., March 1st, 1860.</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Pass the bearer—from 9 to 10<sic corr=":">.</sic>30. P. M. </p>

                  </closer>
                </div1>
              </body>
            </text>
          </q>
          <p>Every person had to have this pass, for at nine 
o'clock each night a bell was rung, and any 
colored persons found on the street after this 
hour were arrested by the watchman, and put in 
the guard-house until next morning, when their 
owners would pay their fines and release them. 
I knew a number of persons who went out at any 
time at night and were never arrested, as the 
watchman knew them so well he never stopped 
them, and seldom asked to see their passes, only 
stopping them long enough, sometimes, to say
“Howdy,” and then telling them to go along.</p>
          <p>About this time I had been reading so much 
about the “Yankees” I was very anxious to see 
them. The whites would tell their colored people 
not to go to the Yankees, for they would harness 
them to carts and make them pull the carts 
around, in place of horses. I asked grandmother, 
one day, if this was true. She replied, 
<pb id="taylor8" n="8"/>
“Certainly not!” that the white people did not want 
slaves to go over to the Yankees, and told them 
these things to frighten them. “Don't you see
those signs pasted about the streets? one reading,
‘I am a rattlesnake; if you touch me I will
strike!’ Another reads, ‘I am a wild-cat! 
Beware,’ etc. These are warnings to the North; so
don't mind what the white people say.” I wanted
to see these wonderful “Yankees” so much, as I
heard my parents say the Yankee was going to
set all the slaves free. Oh, how those people
prayed for freedom! I remember, one night,
my grandmother went out into the suburbs of the
city to a church meeting, and they were fervently
singing this old hymn,—
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“Yes, we all shall be free,</l><l>Yes, we all shall be free, </l><l>Yes, we all shall be free, </l><l>When the Lord shall appear,”</l></lg></q>—
when the police came in and arrested all who were 
there, saying they were planning freedom, and 
sang “the Lord,” in place of “Yankee,” to blind 
any one who might be listening. Grandmother 
never forgot that night, although she did not stay 
in the guard-house, as she sent to her guardian, 
who came at once for her; but this was the last 
meeting she ever attended out of the city proper.</p>
          <p>On April 1, 1862, about the time the Union 
soldiers were firing on Fort Pulaski, I was sent 
out into the country to my mother. I remember
<pb id="taylor9" n="9"/>
what a roar and din the guns made. They jarred 
the earth for miles. The fort was at last taken 
by them. Two days after the taking of Fort 
Pulaski, my uncle took his family of seven and 
myself to St. Catherine Island. We landed under 
the protection of the Union fleet, and remained 
there two weeks, when about thirty of us were 
taken aboard the gunboat P—, to be 
transferred to St. Simon's Island; and at last, to my 
unbounded joy, I saw the “Yankee.”</p>
          <p>After we were all settled aboard and started on 
our journey, Captain Whitmore, commanding the 
boat, asked me where I was from. I told him 
Savannah, Ga. He asked if I could read; I said, 
“Yes!” “Can you write?” he next asked. “Yes, 
I can do that also,” I replied, and as if he had 
some doubts of my answers he handed me a book 
and a pencil and told me to write my name and 
where I was from. I did this; when he wanted 
to know if I could sew. On hearing I could, he 
asked me to hem some napkins for him. He was 
surprised at my accomplishments (for they were 
such in those days), for he said he did not know 
there were any negroes in the South able to read 
or write. He said, “You seem to be so different 
from the other colored people who came from the 
same place you did.” “No!” I replied, “the 
only difference is, they were reared in the country 
and I in the city, as was a man from Darien, 
Ga., named Edward King.” That seemed to
<pb id="taylor10" n="10"/>
satisfy him, and we had no further conversation 
that day on the subject.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon the captain spied a boat in 
the distance, and as it drew nearer he noticed it 
had a white flag hoisted, but before it had reached 
the Putumoka he ordered all passengers between 
decks, so we could not be seen, for he thought 
they might be spies. The boat finally drew alongside 
of our boat, and had Mr. Edward Donegall 
on board, who wanted his two servants, Nick and 
Judith. He wanted these, as they were his own 
children. Our captain told him he knew nothing 
of them, which was true, for at the time they 
were on St. Simon's, and not, as their father 
supposed, on our boat. After the boat left, we 
were allowed to come up on deck again.</p>

<lb/>
ON ST. SIMON'S ISLAND
<lb/>
1862</head>
          <p>NEXT morning we arrived at St. Simon's, and
the captain told Commodore Goldsborough about
this affair, and his reply was, “Captain Whitmore,
you should not have allowed them to return; you
should have kept them.” After I had been on
St. Simon's about three days, Commodore 
Goldsborough heard of me, and came to Gaston Bluff
to see me. I found him very cordial. He said
Captain Whitmore had spoken to him of me, and
that he was pleased to hear of my being so capable, 
etc., and wished me to take charge of a school
for the children on the island. I told him I
would gladly do so, if I could have some books.
He said I should have them, and in a week or two
I received two large boxes of books and 
testaments from the North. I had about forty children
to teach, beside a number of adults who came to
me nights, all of them so eager to learn to read,
to read above anything else. Chaplain French, of
Boston, would come to the school, sometimes, and
lecture to the pupils on Boston and the North.</p>
          <p>About the first of June we were told that there
<pb id="taylor12" n="12"/>
was going to be a settlement of the war. Those 
who were on the Union side would remain free, 
and those in bondage were to work three days for 
their masters and three for themselves. It was 
a gloomy time for us all, and we were to be sent 
to Liberia. Chaplain French asked me would I 
rather go back to Savannah or go to Liberia. I 
told him the latter place by all means. We did 
not know when this would be, but we were 
prepared in case this settlement should be reached. 
However, the Confederates would not agree to the 
arrangement, or else it was one of the many 
rumors flying about at the time, as we heard 
nothing further of the matter. There were a number 
of settlements on this island of St. Simon's, 
just like little villages, and we would go from one 
to the other on business, to call, or only for a 
walk.</p>
          <p>One Sunday, two men, Adam Miller and Daniel 
Spaulding, were chased by some rebels as they 
were coming from Hope Place (which was 
between the Beach and Gaston Bluff), but the latter 
were unable to catch them. When they reached 
the Beach and told this, all the men on the place, 
about ninety, armed themselves, and next day 
(Monday), with Charles O'Neal as their leader, 
skirmished the island for the “rebs.” In a short 
while they discovered them in the woods, hidden 
behind a large log, among the thick underbrush. 
Charles O'Neal was the first to see them, and he
<pb id="taylor13" n="13"/>
was killed; also John Brown, and their bodies 
were never found. Charles O'Neal was an uncle 
of Edward King, who later was my husband and 
a sergeant in Co. E., U. S. I. Another man was 
shot, but not found for three days. On Tuesday, 
the second day, Captain Trowbridge and some 
soldiers landed, and assisted the skirmishers. 
Word having been sent by the mail-boat Uncas 
to Hilton Head, later in the day Commodore 
Goldsborough, who was in command of the naval 
station, landed about three hundred marines, and 
joined the others to oust the rebels. On Wednesday, 
John Baker, the man shot on Monday, was 
found in a terrible condition by Henry Batchlott, 
who carried him to the Beach, where he was 
attended by the surgeon. He told us how, after 
being shot, he lay quiet for a day. On the second 
day he managed to reach some wild grapes growing 
near him. These he ate, to satisfy his hunger 
and intense thirst, then he crawled slowly, every 
movement causing agony, until he got to the side 
of the road. He lived only three months after 
they found him.</p>
          <p>On the second day of the skirmish the troops 
captured a boat which they knew the Confederates 
had used to land in, and having this in their 
possession, the “rebs” could not return; so pickets 
were stationed all around the island. There was 
an old man, Henry Capers, who had been left on 
one of the places by his old master, Mr. Hazzard,
<pb id="taylor14" n="14"/>
as he was too old to carry away. These rebels 
went to his house in the night, and he hid them 
up in the loft. On Tuesday all hands went to 
this man's house with a determination to burn it 
down, but Henry Batchlott pleaded with the men 
to spare it. The rebels were in hiding, still, waiting 
a chance to get off the island. They searched 
his house, but neglected to go up into the loft, 
and in so doing missed the rebels concealed there. 
Late in the night Henry Capers gave them his 
boat to escape in, and they got off all right. This 
old man was allowed by the men in charge of the 
island to cut grass for his horse, and to have a 
boat to carry this grass to his home, and so they 
were not detected, our men thinking it was Capers 
using the boat. After Commodore Goldsborough 
left the island, Commodore Judon sent the old 
man over to the mainland and would not allow 
him to remain on the island.</p>
          <p>There were about six hundred men, women, 
and children on St. Simon's, the women and children 
being in the majority, and we were afraid to 
go very far from our own quarters in the 
daytime, and at night even to go out of the house 
for a long time, although the men were on the 
watch all the time; for there were not any soldiers 
on the island, only the marines who were on the 
gunboats along the coast. The rebels, knowing 
this, could steal by them under cover of the night, 
and getting on the island would capture any 
<pb id="taylor15" n="15"/>
persons venturing out alone and carry them to the 
mainland. Several of the men disappeared, and 
as they were never heard from we came to the 
conclusion they had been carried off in this 
way.</p>
          <p>The latter part of August, 1862, Captain C. T. 
Trowbridge, with his brother John and Lieutenant 
Walker, came to St. Simon's Island from 
Hilton Head, by order of General Hunter, to get 
all the men possible to finish filling his regiment 
which he had organized in March, 1862. He had 
heard of the skirmish on this island, and was very 
much pleased at the bravery shown by these men. 
He found me at Gaston Bluff teaching my little 
school, and was much interested in it. When I 
knew him better I found him to be a thorough 
gentleman and a staunch friend to my race.</p>
          <p>Captain Trowbridge remained with us until 
October, when the order was received to evacuate, 
and so we boarded the Ben-De-Ford, a transport, 
for Beaufort, S. C. When we arrived in Beaufort, 
Captain Trowbridge and the men he had 
enlisted went to camp at Old Fort, which they 
named “Camp Saxton.” I was enrolled as laundress.</p>
          <p>The first suits worn by the boys were red 
coats and pants, which they disliked very much, 
for, they said, “The rebels see us, miles away.”</p>
          <p>The first colored troops did not receive any 
pay for eighteen months, and the men had to 
<pb id="taylor16" n="16"/>
depend wholly on what they received from the 
commissary, established by General Saxton. A great 
many of these men had large families, and as 
they had no money to give them, their wives were 
obliged to support themselves and children by 
washing for the officers of the gunboats and the 
soldiers, and making cakes and pies which they sold 
to the boys in camp. Finally, in 1863, the 
government decided to give them half pay, but the 
men would not accept this. They wanted “full 
pay” or nothing. They preferred rather to give 
their services to the state, which they did until 
1864, when the government granted them full 
pay, with all the back pay due.</p>
          <p>I remember hearing Captain Heasley telling 
his company, one day, “Boys, stand up for your 
full pay! I am with you, and so are all the officers.” 
This captain was from Pennsylvania, and 
was a very good man; all the men liked him. 
N. G. Parker, our first lieutenant, was from 
Massachusetts. H. A. Beach was from New York. 
He was very delicate, and had to resign in 1864 
on account of ill health.</p>
          <p>I had a number of relatives in this regiment, 
—several uncles, some cousins, and a husband in 
Company E, and a number of cousins in other 
companies. Major Strong, of this regiment, 
started home on a furlough, but the vessel he was 
aboard was lost, and he never reached his home. 
He was one of the best officers we had. After
<figure id="ill1" entity="taylo16"><p>Capt. Walker <lb/>Capt. A. W. Heasley <lb/>Capt. Charles E. Parker <lb/>Capt. W. W. Sampson</p></figure>
<pb id="taylor17" n="17"/>
his death, Captain C. T. Trowbridge was promoted 
major, August, 1863, and filled Major Strong's 
place until December, 1864, when he was 
promoted lieutenant-colonel, which he remained 
until he was mustered out, February 6, 1866.</p>
          <p>In February, 1863, several cases of varioloid 
broke out among the boys, which caused some 
anxiety in camp. Edward Davis, of Company E 
(the company I was with), had it very badly. He 
was put into a tent apart from the rest of the 
men, and only the doctor and camp steward, James 
Cummings, were allowed to see or attend him; 
but I went to see this man every day and nursed 
him. The last thing at night, I always went in 
to see that he was comfortable, but in spite of 
the good care and attention he received, he 
succumbed to the disease.</p>
          <p>I was not in the least afraid of the small-pox. 
I had been vaccinated, and I drank sassafras tea 
constantly, which kept my blood purged and 
prevented me from contracting this dread scourge, 
and no one need fear getting it if they will only 
keep their blood in good condition with this sassafras 
tea, and take it before going where the patient 
is.</p>

CAMP SAXTON—PROCLAMATION AND BARBECUE<lb/>
1863</head>
          <p>ON the first of January, 1863, we held services 
for the purpose of listening to the reading of 
President Lincoln's proclamation by Dr. W. H. 
Brisbane, and the presentation of two beautiful 
stands of colors, one from a lady in Connecticut, 
and the other from Rev. Mr. Cheever. The 
presentation speech was made by Chaplain French. 
It was a glorious day for us all, and we enjoyed 
every minute of it, and as a fitting close and the 
crowning event of this occasion we had a grand 
barbecue. A number of oxen were roasted whole, 
and we had a fine feast. Although not served as 
tastily or correctly as it would have been at home, 
yet it was enjoyed with keen appetites and relish. 
The soldiers had a good time. They sang or 
shouted “Hurrah!” all through the camp, and 
seemed overflowing with fun and frolic until taps 
were sounded, when many, no doubt, dreamt of 
this memorable day.</p>
          <p>I had rather an amusing experience; that is, it 
seems amusing now, as I look back, but at the 
time it occurred it was a most serious one to me.
<pb id="taylor19" n="19"/>
When our regiment left Beaufort for Seabrooke, 
I left some of my things with a neighbor who 
lived outside of the camp. After I had been at 
Seabrooke about a week, I decided to return to 
Camp Saxton and get them. So one morning, with 
Mary Shaw, a friend who was in the company 
at that time, I started off. There was no way 
for us to get to Beaufort other than to walk, 
except we rode on the commissary wagon. This 
we did, and reached Beaufort about one o'clock. 
We then had more than two miles to walk before 
reaching our old camp, and expected to be able 
to accomplish this and return in time to meet the 
wagon again by three o'clock that afternoon, and 
so be taken back. We failed to do this, however, 
for when we got to Beaufort the wagon was gone. 
We did not know what to do. I did not wish 
to remain overnight, neither did my friend, 
although we might easily have stayed, as both had 
relatives in the town.</p>
          <p>It was in the springtime, and the days were 
long, and as the sun looked so bright, we 
concluded to walk back, thinking we should reach 
camp before dark. So off we started on our 
ten-mile tramp. We had not gone many miles, 
however, before we were all tired out and began 
to regret our undertaking. The sun was getting 
low, and we grew more frightened, fearful of 
meeting some animal or of treading on a snake on 
our way. We did not meet a person, and we
<pb id="taylor20" n="20"/>
were frightened almost to death. Our feet were 
so sore we could hardly walk. Finally we took 
off our shoes and tried walking in our stocking 
feet, but this made them worse. We had gone 
about six miles when night overtook us. There 
we were, nothing around us but dense woods, and 
as there was no house or any place to stop at, 
there was nothing for us to do but continue on. 
We were afraid to speak to each other.</p>
          <p>Meantime at the camp, seeing no signs of us 
by dusk, they concluded we had decided to 
remain over until next day, and so had no idea of 
our plight. Imagine their surprise when we 
reached camp about eleven P. M. The guard 
challenged us, “Who comes there?” My 
answer was, “A friend without a countersign.” He 
approached and saw who it was, reported, and 
we were admitted into the lines. They had the 
joke on us that night, and for a long time after 
would tease us; and sometimes some of the men 
who were on guard that night would call us 
deserters. They used to laugh at us, but we joined 
with them too, especially when we would tell 
them our experience on our way to camp. I did 
not undertake that trip again, as there was no 
way of getting in or out except one took the 
provision wagon, and there was not much dependence 
to be put in that returning to camp. Perhaps 
the driver would say one hour and he might 
be there earlier or later. Of course it was not
<pb id="taylor21" n="21"/>
his fault, as it depended when the order was 
filled at the Commissary Department; therefore 
I did not go any more until the regiment was 
ordered to our new camp, which was named after 
our hero, Colonel Shaw, who at that time was at 
Beaufort with his regiment, the 54th Massachusetts.</p>
          <p>I taught a great many of the comrades in 
Company E to read and write, when they were off 
duty. Nearly all were anxious to learn. My 
husband taught some also when it was convenient 
for him. I was very happy to know my efforts 
were successful in camp, and also felt grateful for 
the appreciation of my services. I gave my 
services willingly for four years and three months 
without receiving a dollar. I was glad, however, 
to be allowed to go with the regiment, to care for 
the sick and afflicted comrades.</p>

MILITARY EXPEDITIONS, AND LIFE IN CAMP</head>
          <p>IN the latter part of 1862 the regiment made 
an expedition into Darien, Georgia, and up the 
Ridge, and on January 23, 1863, another up St. 
Mary's River, capturing a number of stores for 
the government; then on to Fernandina, Florida. 
They were gone ten or twelve days, at the end of 
which time they returned to camp.</p>
          <p>March 10, 1863, we were ordered to Jacksonville, 
Florida. Leaving Camp Saxton between 
four and five o'clock, we arrived at Jacksonville 
about eight o'clock next morning, accompanied 
by three or four gunboats. When the rebels saw 
these boats, they ran out of the city, leaving the 
women behind, and we found out afterwards that 
they thought we had a much larger fleet than 
we really had. Our regiment was kept out of 
sight until we made fast at the wharf where it 
landed, and while the gunboats were shelling up 
the river and as far inland as possible, the 
regiment landed and marched up the street, where 
they spied the rebels who had fled from the city. 
They were hiding behind a house about a mile

themselves as negroes, and our boys, as they 
advanced toward them, halted a second, saying, 
“They are black men! Let them come to us, or 
we will make them know who we are.” With 
this, the firing was opened and several of our 
men were wounded and killed. The rebels had 
a number wounded and killed. It was through 
this way the discovery was made that they were 
white men. Our men drove them some distance 
in retreat and then threw out their pickets.</p>
          <p>While the fighting was on, a friend, Lizzie 
Lancaster, and I stopped at several of the rebel 
homes, and after talking with some of the women
and children we asked them if they had any food. 
They claimed to have only some hard-tack, and 
evidently did not care to give us anything to eat, 
but this was not surprising. They were bitterly 
against our people and had no mercy or 
sympathy for us.</p>
          <p>The second day, our boys were reinforced by 
a regiment of white soldiers, a Maine regiment, 
and by cavalry, and had quite a fight. On the 
third day, Edward Herron, who was a fine gunner 
on the steamer John Adams, came on shore, 
bringing a small cannon, which the men pulled 
along for more than five miles. This cannon 
was the only piece for shelling. On coming upon 
the enemy, all secured their places, and they 
had a lively fight, which lasted several hours, and 
our boys were nearly captured by the Confederates;
<pb id="taylor24" n="24"/>
but the Union boys carried out all their
plans that day, and succeeded in driving the
enemy back. After this skirmish, every afternoon 
between four and five o'clock the Confederate 
General Finegan would send a flag of truce to
Colonel Higginson, warning him to send all 
women and children out of the city, and threatening
to bombard it if this was not done. Our colonel
allowed all to go who wished, at first, but as 
General Finegan grew more hostile and kept sending
these communications for nearly a week, Colonel
Higginson thought it not best or necessary to
send any more out of the city, and so informed
General Finegan. This angered the general,
for that night the rebels shelled directly toward
Colonel Higginson's headquarters. The shelling
was so heavy that the colonel told my captain to
have me taken up into the town to a hotel, which
was used as a hospital. As my quarters were
just in the rear of the colonel's, he was compelled
to leave his also before the night was over. I
expected every moment to be killed by a shell,
but on arriving at the hospital I knew I was
safe, for the shells could not reach us there. It
was plainly to be seen now, the ruse of the flag
of truce coming so often to us. The bearer was
evidently a spy getting the location of the 
headquarters, etc., for the shells were sent too 
accurately to be at random.</p>
          <p>Next morning Colonel Higginson took the 
<figure id="ill2" entity="taylo24"><p>THOMAS WENTWORTH HIGGINSON <lb/>

<pb id="taylor25" n="25"/>
cavalry and a regiment on another tramp after the 
rebels. They were gone several days and had the 
hardest fight they had had, for they wanted to go 
as far as a station which was some distance from 
the city. The gunboats were of little assistance 
to them, yet notwithstanding this drawback our 
boys returned with only a few killed and wounded, 
and after this we were not troubled with General 
Finegan.</p>
          <p>We remained here a few weeks longer, when, 
about April first, the regiment was ordered back 
to Camp Saxton, where it stayed a week, when 
the order came to go to Port Royal Ferry on 
picket duty. It was a gay day for the boys. By 
seven o'clock all tents were down, and each 
company, with a commissary wagon, marched up the 
shell road, which is a beautiful avenue ten or 
twelve miles out of Beaufort. We arrived at 
Seabrooke at about four o'clock, where our tents 
were pitched and the men put on duty. We were 
here a few weeks, when Company E was ordered 
to Barnwell plantation for picket duty.</p>
          <p>Some mornings I would go along the picket 
line, and I could see the rebels on the opposite 
side of the river. Sometimes as they were changing 
pickets they would call over to our men and 
ask for something to eat, or for tobacco, and our 
men would tell them to come over. Sometimes 
one or two would desert to us, saying, they “had 
no negroes to fight for.” Others would shoot
<pb id="taylor26" n="26"/>
across at our picket, but as the river was so wide 
there was never any damage done, and the 
Confederates never attempted to shell us while we 
were there.</p>
          <p>I learned to handle a musket very well while 
in the regiment, and could shoot straight and often 
hit the target. I assisted in cleaning the guns 
and used to fire them off, to see if the cartridges 
were dry, before cleaning and reloading, each day. 
I thought this great fun. I was also able to take 
a gun all apart, and put it together again.</p>
          <p>Between Barnwell and the mainland was Hall 
Island. I went over there several times with 
Sergeant King and other comrades. One night there 
was a stir in camp when it was found that the 
rebels were trying to cross, and next morning 
Lieutenant Parker told me he thought they were 
on Hall Island; so after that I did not go over 
again.</p>
          <p>While planning for the expedition up the 
Edisto River, Colonel Higginson was a whole 
night in the water, trying to locate the rebels and 
where their picket lines were situated. About 
July the boys went up the Edisto to destroy a 
bridge on the Charleston and Savannah road. 
This expedition was twenty or more miles into 
the mainland. Colonel Higginson was wounded 
in this fight and the regiment nearly captured. 
The steamboat John Adams always assisted us, 
carrying soldiers, provisions, etc. She carried
<pb id="taylor27" n="27"/>
several guns and a good gunner, Edward Herron. 
Henry Batchlott, a relative of mine, was a steward 
on this boat. There were two smaller boats, 
Governor Milton and the Enoch Dean, in the 
fleet, as these could go up the river better than 
the larger ones could. I often went aboard the 
John Adams. It went with us into Jacksonville, 
to Cole and Folly Island, and Gunner Herron was 
always ready to send a shell at the enemy.</p>
          <p>One night, Companies K and E, on their way 
to Pocotaligo to destroy a battery that was 
situated down the river, captured several prisoners. 
The rebels nearly captured Sergeant King, who, 
as he sprang and caught a “reb,” fell over an 
embankment. In falling he did not release his 
hold on his prisoner. Although his hip was 
severely injured, he held fast until some of his 
comrades came to his aid and pulled them up. These 
expeditions were very dangerous. Sometimes the 
men had to go five or ten miles during the night 
over on the rebel side and capture or destroy 
whatever they could find.</p>
          <p>While at Camp Shaw, there was a deserter who 
came into Beaufort. He was allowed his freedom 
about the city and was not molested. He 
remained about the place a little while and returned 
to the rebels again. On his return to Beaufort a 
second time, he was held as a spy, tried, and 
sentenced to death, for he was a traitor. The day 
he was shot, he was placed on a hearse with his
<pb id="taylor28" n="28"/>
coffin inside, a guard was placed either side of the 
hearse, and he was driven through the town. All 
the soldiers and people in town were out, as this 
was to be a warning to the soldiers. Our regiment 
was in line on dress parade. They drove 
with him to the rear of our camp, where he was 
shot. I shall never forget this scene.</p>
          <p>While at Camp Shaw, Chaplain Fowler, Robert 
Defoe, and several of our boys were captured 
while tapping some telegraph wires. Robert 
Defoe was confined in the jail at Walterborough, 
S. C., for about twenty months. When Sherman's 
army reached Pocotaligo he made his escape and 
joined his company (Company G). He had not 
been paid, as he had refused the reduced pay 
offered by the government. Before we got to camp, 
where the pay-rolls could be made out, he sickened 
and died of small-pox, and was buried at Savannah, 
never having been paid one cent for nearly 
three years of service. He left no heirs and his 
account was never settled.</p>
          <p>In winter, when it was very cold, I would take 
a mess-pan, put a little earth in the bottom, and 
go to the cook-shed and fill it nearly full of coals, 
carry it back to my tent and put another pan 
over it; so when the provost guard went through 
camp after taps, they would not see the light, as 
it was against the rules to have a light after taps. 
In this way I was heated and kept very warm.</p>
          <p>A mess-pan is made of sheet iron, something

<pb n="29"/>
like our roasting pans, only they are nearly as
large round as a peck measure, but not so deep.
We had fresh beef once in awhile, and we would 
have soup, and the vegetables they put in this 
soup were dried and pressed. They looked like 
hops. Salt beef was our stand-by. Sometimes 
the men would have what we called slap-jacks. 
This was flour, made into bread and spread thin 
on the bottom of the mess-pan to cook. Each 
man had one of them, with a pint of tea, for his 
supper, or a pint of tea and five or six hard-tack. 
I often got my own meals, and would fix some 
dishes for the non-commissioned officers also.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Chamberlain, our quartermaster's wife,
was with us here. She was a beautiful woman;
I can see her pleasant face before me now, as she,
with Captain Trowbridge, would sit and converse
with me in my tent two or three hours at a time.
She was also with me on Cole Island, and I think
we were the only women with the regiment while
there. I remember well how, when she first came
into camp, Captain Trowbridge brought her to
my tent and introduced her to me. I found her
then, as she remained ever after, a lovely person,
and I always admired her cordial and friendly
ways.</p>
          <p>Our boys would say to me sometimes “Mrs. 
King, why is it you are so kind to us? you treat 
us just as you do the boys in your own company.” 
I replied, “Well, you know, all the boys in other
<pb id="taylor30" n="30"/>
companies are the same to me as those in my 
Company E; you are all doing the same duty, 
and I will do just the same for you.” “Yes,” they 
would say, “we know that, because you were the 
first woman we saw when we came into camp, and 
you took an interest in us boys ever since we have 
been here, and we are very grateful for all you do 
for us.”</p>
          <p>When at Camp Shaw, I visited the hospital in
Beaufort, where I met Clara Barton. There
were a number of sick and wounded soldiers there,
and I went often to see the comrades. Miss 
Barton was always very cordial toward me, and I
honored her for her devotion and care of those
men.</p>
          <p>There was a man, John Johnson, who with his 
family was taken by our regiment at Edisto. 
This man afterwards worked in the hospital and 
was well known to Miss Barton. I have been told 
since that when she went South, in 1883, she tried 
to look this man up, but learned he was dead. 
His son is living in Edisto, Rev. J. J. Johnson, 
and is the president of an industrial school on 
that island and a very intelligent man. He was 
a small child when his father and family were 
captured by our regiment at Edisto.</p>

<lb/>
ON MORRIS AND OTHER ISLANDS</head>
          <p>FORT WAGNER being only a mile from our camp, 
I went there two or three times a week, and 
would go up on the ramparts to watch the gunners 
send their shells into Charleston (which they did 
every fifteen minutes), and had a full view of the 
city from that point. Outside of the fort were 
many skulls lying about; I have often moved them 
one side out of the path. The comrades and I 
would have quite a debate as to which side the 
men fought on. Some thought they were the 
skulls of our boys; others thought they were the 
enemy's; but as there was no definite way to 
know, it was never decided which could lay claim 
to them. They were a gruesome sight, those 
fleshless heads and grinning jaws, but by this time 
I had become accustomed to worse things and did 
not feel as I might have earlier in my camp life.</p>
          <p>It seems strange how our aversion to seeing 
suffering is overcome in war,— how we are able to 
see the most sickening sights, such as men with 
their limbs blown off and mangled by the deadly 
shells, without a shudder; and instead of turning 
away, how we hurry to assist in alleviating their
<pb id="taylor32" n="32"/>
pain, bind up their wounds, and press the cool 
water to their parched lips, with feelings only of 
sympathy and pity.</p>
          <p>About the first of June, 1864, the regiment 
was ordered to Folly Island, staying there until 
the latter part of the month, when it was ordered 
to Morris Island. We landed on Morris Island 
between June and July, 1864. This island was 
a narrow strip of sandy soil, nothing growing on 
it but a few bushes and shrubs. The camp was 
one mile from the boat landing, called Pawnell 
Landing, and the landing one mile from Fort 
Wagner.</p>
          <p>Colonel Higginson had left us in May of this 
year, on account of wounds received at Edisto. 
All the men were sorry to lose him. They did 
not want him to go, they loved him so. He was 
kind and devoted to his men, thoughtful for their 
comfort, and we missed his genial presence from 
the camp.</p>
          <p>The regiment under Colonel Trowbridge did 
garrison duty, but they had troublesome times 
from Fort Gregg, on James Island, for the rebels 
would throw a shell over on our island every now 
and then. Finally orders were received for the 
boys to prepare to take Fort Gregg, each man to 
take 150 rounds of cartridges, canteens of water, 
hard-tack, and salt beef. This order was sent 
three days prior to starting, to allow them to be 
in readiness. I helped as many as I could to 
pack haversacks and cartridge boxes.</p>
          <pb id="taylor33" n="33"/>
          <p>The fourth day, about five o'clock in the afternoon, 
the call was sounded, and I heard the first 
sergeant say, “Fall in, boys, fall in,” and they 
were not long obeying the command. Each 
company marched out of its street, in front of their 
colonel's headquarters, where they rested for half 
an hour, as it was not dark enough, and they did 
not want the enemy to have a chance to spy their 
movements. At the end of this time the line was 
formed with the 103d New York (white) in the 
rear, and off they started, eager to get to work. 
It was quite dark by the time they reached Pawnell 
Landing. I have never forgotten the good-bys 
of that day, as they left camp. Colonel 
Trowbridge said to me as he left, “Good-by, 
Mrs. King, take care of yourself if you don't see 
us again.” I went with them as far as the landing, 
and watched them until they got out of sight, 
and then I returned to the camp. There was no 
one at camp but those left on picket and a few 
disabled soldiers, and one woman, a friend of 
mine, Mary Shaw, and it was lonesome and sad, 
now that the boys were gone, some never to 
return.</p>
          <p>Mary Shaw shared my tent that night, and we 
went to bed, but not to sleep, for the fleas nearly 
ate us alive. We caught a few, but it did seem, 
now that the men were gone, that every flea in 
camp had located my tent, and caused us to 
vacate. Sleep being out of the question, we sat up 
the remainder of the night.</p>
          <pb id="taylor34" n="34"/>
          <p>About four o'clock, July 2, the charge was 
made. The firing could be plainly heard in 
camp. I hastened down to the landing and 
remained there until eight o'clock that morning. 
When the wounded arrived, or rather began to 
arrive, the first one brought in was Samuel 
Anderson of our company. He was badly wounded. 
Then others of our boys, some with their legs off, 
arm gone, foot off, and wounds of all kinds 
imaginable. They had to wade through creeks and 
marshes, as they were discovered by the enemy 
and shelled very badly. A number of the men 
were lost, some got fastened in the mud and had 
to cut off the legs of their pants, to free 
themselves. The 103d New York suffered the most, 
as their men were very badly wounded.</p>
          <p>My work now began. I gave my assistance to 
try to alleviate their sufferings. I asked the doctor 
at the hospital what I could get for them to 
eat. They wanted soup, but that I could not get; 
but I had a few cans of condensed milk and some 
turtle eggs, so I thought I would try to make 
some custard. I had doubts as to my success, 
for cooking with turtle eggs was something new 
to me, but the adage has it, “Nothing ventured, 
nothing done,” so I made a venture and the 
result was a very delicious custard. This I carried 
to the men, who enjoyed it very much. My 
services were given at all times for the comfort of 
these men. I was on hand to assist whenever
<pb id="taylor35" n="35"/>
needed. I was enrolled as company laundress, 
but I did very little of it, because I was always 
busy doing other things through camp, and was 
employed all the time doing something for the 
officers and comrades.</p>
          <p>After this fight, the regiment did not return 
to the camp for one month. They were ordered 
to Cole Island in September, where they remained 
until October. About November 1, 1864, six 
companies were detailed to go to Gregg Landing, 
Port Royal Ferry, and the rebels in some way 
found out some of our forces had been removed 
and gave our boys in camp a hard time of it, for 
several nights. In fact, one night it was thought 
the boys would have to retreat. The colonel told 
me to go down to the landing, and if they were 
obliged to retreat, I could go aboard one of our 
gunboats. One of the gunboats got in the rear, 
and began to shell General Beauregard's force, 
which helped our boys retain their possession.</p>
          <p>About November 15, I received a letter from 
Sergeant King, saying the boys were still lying 
three miles from Gregg Landing and had not 
had a fight yet; that the rebels were waiting on 
them and they on the rebels, and each were holding 
their own; also that General Sherman had 
taken Fort McAllister, eight miles from Savannah. 
After receiving this letter I wanted to get 
to Beaufort, so I could be near to them and so 
be able to get news from my husband. November
<pb id="taylor36" n="36"/>
23 I got a pass for Beaufort. I arrived at Hilton 
Head about three o'clock next day, but there 
had been a battle, and a steamer arrived with a 
number of wounded men; so I could not get a 
transfer to Beaufort. The doctor wished me to 
remain over until Monday. I did not want to 
stay. I was anxious to get off, as I knew no one 
at Hilton Head.</p>
          <p>I must mention a pet pig we had on Cole Island. 
Colonel Trowbridge brought into camp, one day, 
a poor, thin little pig, which a German soldier 
brought back with him on his return from a 
furlough. His regiment, the 74th Pennsylvania, 
was just embarking for the North, where it was 
ordered to join the 10th corps, and he could not 
take the pig back with him, so he gave it to our 
colonel. That pig grew to be the pet of the 
camp, and was the special care of the drummer 
boys, who taught him many tricks; and so well 
did they train him that every day at practice and 
dress parade, his pigship would march out with 
them, keeping perfect time with their music. 
The drummers would often disturb the devotions 
by riding this pig into the midst of evening praise 
meeting, and many were the complaints made to 
the colonel, but he was always very lenient 
towards the boys, for he knew they only did this 
for mischief. I shall never forget the fun we 
had in camp with “Piggie.”</p>

<lb/>
CAST AWAY</head>
          <p>THERE was a yacht that carried passengers 
from Hilton Head to Beaufort. There were also 
five small boats which carried people over. The 
only people here, beside the soldiers, were Mrs. 
Lizzie Brown, who came over on a permit to 
see her husband, who was at this place, and was 
very ill (he died while she was there), Corporal 
Walker's wife, with her two years old child, and 
Mrs. Seabrooke. As soon as we could get the 
yacht, these persons I have mentioned, together 
with a comrade just discharged, an officer's boy, 
and myself, took passage on it for Beaufort. It 
was nearly dark before we had gone any distance, 
and about eight o'clock we were cast away and 
were only saved through the mercy of God. I 
remember going down twice. As I rose the 
second time, I caught hold of the sail and 
managed to hold fast. Mrs. Walker held on to her 
child with one hand, while with the other she 
managed to hold fast to some part of the boat, 
and we drifted and shouted as loud as we could, 
trying to attract the attention of some of the 
government boats which were going up and down
<pb id="taylor38" n="38"/>
the river. But it was in vain, we could not make 
ourselves heard, and just when we gave up all 
hope, and in the last moment (as we thought) 
gave one more despairing cry, we were heard at
Ladies' Island. Two boats were put off and a
search was made, to locate our distressed boat.
They found us at last, nearly dead from exposure.
In fact, the poor little baby was dead, although
her mother still held her by her clothing, with
her teeth. The soldier was drowned, having been
caught under the sail and pinned down. The
rest of us were saved. I had to be carried bodily,
as I was thoroughly exhausted. We were given
the best attention that we could get at this place
where we were picked up. The men who saved
us were surprised when they found me among the
passengers, as one of them, William Geary, of
Darien, Georgia, was a friend of my husband.
His mother lived about two miles from where we
were picked up, and she told me she had heard
cries for a long time that night, and was very 
uneasy about it. Finally, she said to her son, “I 
think some poor souls are cast away.” “I don't
think so, mother,” he replied; “I saw some people 
going down the river to-day. You know this
is Christmas, and they are having a good time.”
But she still persisted that these were cries of
distress, and not of joy, and begged him to go
out and see. So to satisfy her, he went outside
and listened, and then he heard them also, and
<pb id="taylor39" n="39"/>
hastened to get the boats off to find us. We 
were capsized about 8<sic corr=":">.</sic>15 P. M. and it was near 
midnight when they found us. Next day, they 
kept a sharp lookout on the beach for anything 
that might be washed in from the yacht, and got 
a trunk and several other things. Had the tide 
been going out, we should have been carried to 
sea and lost.</p>
          <p>I was very ill and under the doctor's care for 
some time, in Beaufort. The doctor said I ought 
to have been rolled, as I had swallowed so much 
water. In January, 1865, I went back to Cole 
Island, where I could be attended by my doctor, 
Dr. Miner, who did all in his power to alleviate 
my suffering, for I was swollen very much. This 
he reduced and I recovered, but had a severe 
cough for a long time afterward.</p>

<lb/>
A FLAG OF TRUCE</head>
          <p>IN October, 1864, six companies of the regiment 
were ordered to Gregg Landing, S. C. 
Captain L. W. Metcalf, of Co. G, was appointed 
on General Saxton's staff as provost captain, 
Lieutenant James B. West acting as assistant 
general. As in some way our mail had been sent 
over to the Confederate side and their mail to 
us, Captain Metcalf and Lieutenant West were 
detailed to exchange these letters under a flag of 
truce. So, with an escort of six men of the 
companies at Port Royal Ferry, the flag was unfurled 
and the message shouted across the river to the 
Confederates. Captain Metcalf asked them to 
come over to our side under the protection of our 
flag of truce. This the Confederates refused to 
do, having for their excuse that their boat was 
too far up the river and so they had no way to 
cross the river to us. They asked Metcalf to 
cross to them. He at once ordered his men to 
“stack arms,” the Confederates following suit, 
and his boys in blue rowed him over, and he 
delivered the message, after having introduced 
himself to the rebel officers. One of these officers
<figure id="ill5" entity="taylo40"><p>CAPT. MIRON W. SAXTON <lb/>CAPT. L. W. METCALF <lb/>CAPT. A. W. JACKSON <lb/>CORPORAL PETER WAGGALL</p></figure>
<pb id="taylor41" n="41"/>
was Major Jones, of Alabama, the other Lieutenant 
Scott, of South Carolina. Major Jones was 
very cordial to our captain, but Lieutenant Scott 
would not extend his hand, and stood aside, in 
sullen silence, looking as if he would like to take 
revenge then and there. Major Jones said to 
Captain Metcalf, “We have no one to fight for. 
Should I meet you again, I shall not forget we 
have met before.” With this he extended his 
hand to Metcalf and bade him good-by, but 
Lieutenant Scott stood by and looked as cross as he 
possibly could. The letters were exchanged, but 
it seemed a mystery just how those letters got 
mis-sent to the opposite sides. Captain Metcalf said 
he did not feel a mite comfortable while he was 
on the Confederate soil; as for his men, you can 
imagine their thoughts. I asked them how they 
felt on the other side, and they said, “We would 
have felt much better if we had had our guns with 
us.” It was a little risky, for sometimes the flag 
of truce is not regarded, but even among the

          <p>Captain Metcalf is still living in Medford. He 
is 71 years old, and just as loyal to the old flag 
and the G. A. R. as he was from 1861 to 1866, 
when he was mustered out. He was a brave 
captain, a good officer, and was honored and beloved 
by all in the regiment.</p>

CAPTURE OF CHARLESTON</head>
          <p>ON February 28, 1865, the remainder of the 
regiment were ordered to Charleston, as there 
were signs of the rebels evacuating that city. 
Leaving Cole Island, we arrived in Charleston 
between nine and ten o'clock in the morning, and 
found the “rebs” had set fire to the city and fled, 
leaving women and children behind to suffer and 
perish in the flames. The fire had been burning 
fiercely for a day and night. When we landed, 
under a flag of truce, our regiment went to work 
assisting the citizens in subduing the flames. It 
was a terrible scene. For three or four days the 
men fought the fire, saving the property and 
effects of the people, yet these white men and 
women could not tolerate our black Union 
soldiers, for many of them had formerly been their 
slaves; and although these brave men risked life 
and limb to assist them in their distress, men 
and even women would sneer and molest them 
whenever they met them.</p>
          <p>I had quarters assigned me at a residence on 
South Battery Street, one of the most aristocratic 
parts of the city, where I assisted in caring for
<pb id="taylor43" n="43"/>
the sick and injured comrades. After getting the 
fire under control, the regiment marched out to 
the race track, where they camped until March 
12, when we were ordered to Savannah, Ga. 
We arrived there on the 13th, about eight o'clock 
in the evening, and marched out to Fairlong, near 
the A.&amp;G. R. R., where we remained about ten 
days, when we were ordered to Augusta, Ga., 
where Captain Alexander Heasley, of Co. E, 
was shot and killed by a Confederate. After his 
death Lieutenant Parker was made captain of the 
company, and was with us until the regiment was 
mustered out. He often told me about 
Massachusetts, but I had no thought at that time that 
I should ever see that State, and stand in the
“Cradle of Liberty.”</p>
          <p>The regiment remained in Augusta for thirty 
days, when it was ordered to Hamburg, S. C., and 
then on to Charleston. It was while on their 
march through the country, to the latter city, 
that they came in contact with the bushwhackers 
(as the rebels were called), who hid in the 
bushes and would shoot the Union boys every 
chance they got. Other times they would conceal 
themselves in the cars used to transfer our soldiers, 
and when our boys, worn out and tired, would fall 
asleep, these men would come out from their hiding 
places and cut their throats. Several of our 
men were killed in this way, but it could not be 
found out who was committing these murders 
<pb id="taylor44" n="44"/>
until one night one of the rebels was caught in the 
act, trying to cut the throat of a sleeping 
soldier. He was put under guard, court-martialed, 
and shot at Wall Hollow.</p>
          <p>First Lieutenant Jerome T. Furman and a number 
of soldiers were killed by these South Carolina 
bushwhackers at Wall Hollow. After this man 
was shot, however, the regiment marched through 
unmolested to Charleston.</p>

MUSTERED OUT</head>
          <p>THE regiment, under Colonel Trowbridge, 
reached Charleston in November, 1865, and 
camped on the race track until January, when they 
returned to Morris Island, and on February 9, 
1866, the following “General Orders ” were 
received and the regiment mustered out.</p>
          <p>They were delighted to go home, but oh! how 
they hated to part from their commanding chief, 
Colonel C. T. Trowbridge. He was the very first 
officer to take charge of black soldiers. We 
thought there was no one like him, for he was a 
“man” among his soldiers. All in the regiment 
knew him personally, and many were the jokes 
he used to tell them. I shall never forget his 
friendship and kindness toward me, from the first 
time I met him to the end of the war. There was 
never any one from the North who came into our 
camp but he would bring them to see me.</p>
          <p>While on a visit South in 1888, I met a 
comrade of the regiment, who often said to me, “You 
up North, Mrs. King, do you ever see Colonel 
Trowbridge? How I should like to see him! I 
don't see why he does not come South sometime.
<pb id="taylor46" n="46"/>
Why, I would take a day off and look up all the 
‘boys’I could find, if I knew he was coming.” 
I knew this man meant what he said, for the men 
of the regiment knew Colonel Trowbridge first of 
all the other officers. He was with them on St. 
Simon and at Camp Saxton. I remember when 
the company was being formed, we wished 
Captain C. T. was our captain, because most of the 
men in Co. E were the men he brought with him 
from St. Simon, and they were attached to him. 
He was always jolly and pleasing with all. I 
remember, when going into Savannah in 1865, he 
said that he had been there before the war, and 
told me many things I did not know about the 
river. Although this was my home, I had never 
been on it before. No officer in the army was 
more beloved than our late lieutenant-colonel, C. 
T. Trowbridge.</p>

the first black regiment that ever bore arms in 
defense of freedom on the continent of America.</p>
                  <p>“On the 9th day of May, 1862, at which time 
there were nearly four millions of your race in 
bondage, sanctioned by the laws of the land and 
protected by our flag,—on that day, in the face 
of the floods of prejudice that well-nigh deluged 
every avenue to manhood and true liberty, you 
came forth to do battle for your country and 
kindred.</p>
                  <p>“For long and weary months, without pay or 
even the privilege of being recognized as soldiers, 
you labored on, only to be disbanded and sent to 
your homes without even a hope of reward, and 
when our country, necessitated by the deadly 
struggle with armed traitors, finally granted you 
the opportunity again to come forth in defense 
of the nation's life, the alacrity with which you 
responded to the call gave abundant evidence of 
your readiness to strike a manly blow for the 
liberty of your race. And from that little band 
of hopeful, trusting, and brave men who gathered 
at Camp Saxton, on Port Royal Island, in the fall 
of '62, amidst the terrible prejudices that 
surrounded us, has grown an army of a hundred and 
forty thousand black soldiers, whose valor and 
heroism has won for your race a name which 
will live as long as the undying pages of history 
shall endure; and by whose efforts, united with 
those of the white man, armed rebellion has been
<pb id="taylor48" n="48"/>
conquered, the millions of bondsmen have been 
emancipated, and the fundamental law of the land 
has been so altered as to remove forever the 
possibility of human slavery being established within 
the borders of redeemed America. The flag of 
our fathers, restored to its rightful significance, 
now floats over every foot of our territory, from 
Maine to California, and beholds only free men! 
The prejudices which formerly existed against 
you are well-nigh rooted out.</p>
                  <p>“Soldiers, you have done your duty and 
acquitted yourselves like men who, actuated by such 
ennobling motives, could not fail; and as the 
result of your fidelity and obedience you have won 
your freedom, and oh, how great the reward! 
It seems fitting to me that the last hours of our 
existence as a regiment should be passed amidst 
the unmarked graves of your comrades, at Fort 
Wagner. Near you rest the bones of Colonel 
Shaw, buried by an enemy's hand in the same 
grave with his black soldiers who fell at his side; 
where in the future your children's children will 
come on pilgrimages to do homage to the ashes of 
those who fell in this glorious struggle.</p>
                  <p>“The flag which was presented to us by the Rev. 
George B. Cheever and his congregation, of New 
York city, on the 1st of January, 1863,—the day 
when Lincoln's immortal proclamation of freedom 
was given to the world,—and which you have 
borne so nobly through the war, is now to be
<pb id="taylor49" n="49"/>
rolled up forever and deposited in our nation's 
capital. And while there it shall rest, with the 
battles in which you have participated inscribed 
upon its folds, it will be a source of pride to us 
all to remember that it has never been disgraced 
by a cowardly faltering in the hour of danger, or 
polluted by a traitor's touch.</p>
                  <p>“Now that you are to lay aside your arms, I 
adjure you, by the associations and history of the 
past, and the love you bear for your liberties, to 
harbor no feelings of hatred toward your former 
masters, but to seek in the paths of honesty, 
virtue, sobriety, and industry, and by a willing 
obedience to the laws of the land, to grow up to the 
full stature of American citizens. The church, 
the school-house, and the right forever to be free 
are now secured to you, and every prospect 
before you is full of hope and encouragement. The 
nation guarantees to you full protection and 
justice, and will require from you in return that 
respect for the laws and orderly deportment which 
will prove to every one your right to all the 
privileges of freemen. To the officers of the 
regiment I would say, your toils are ended, your 
mission is fulfilled, and we separate forever. The 
fidelity, patience, and patriotism with which you 
have discharged your duties to your men and 
to your country entitle you to a far higher tribute 
than any words of thankfulness which I can 
give you from the bottom of my heart. You will
<pb id="taylor50" n="50"/>
find your reward in the proud conviction that the 
cause for which you have battled so nobly has 
been crowned with abundant success.</p>

          <p>I have one of the original copies of these orders 
still in my possession.</p>
          <p>My dear friends! do we understand the meaning 
of war? Do we know or think of that war 
of '61? No, we do not, only those brave soldiers, 
and those who had occasion to be in it, can realize 
what it was. I can and shall never forget 
that terrible war until my eyes close in death. 
The scenes are just as fresh in my mind to-day as 
in '61. I see now each scene,—the roll-call, the 
drum tap, “lights out,” the call at night when 
there was danger from the enemy, the double 
force of pickets, the cold and rain. How anxious 
I would be, not knowing what would happen 
before morning! Many times I would dress, not 
sure but all would be captured. Other times I 
would stand at my tent door and try to see what 
was going on, because night was the time the
<pb id="taylor51" n="51"/>
rebels would try to get into our lines and capture 
some of the boys. It was mostly at night that 
our men went out for their scouts, and often had 
a hand to hand fight with the rebels, and although 
our men came out sometimes with a few killed 
or wounded, none of them ever were captured.</p>
          <p>We do not, as the black race, properly appreciate 
the old veterans, white or black, as we 
ought to. I know what they went through, 
especially those black men, for the Confederates had 
no mercy on them; neither did they show any 
toward the white Union soldiers. I have seen 
the terrors of that war. I was the wife of one 
of those men who did not get a penny for eighteen 
months for their services, only their rations 
and clothing.</p>
          <p>I cannot praise General David Hunter too 
highly, for he was the first man to arm the black 
man, in the beginning of 1862. He had a hard 
struggle to hold all the southern division, with 
so few men, so he applied to Congress; but the 
answer to him was, “Do not bother us,” which 
was very discouraging. As the general needed 
more men to protect the islands and do garrison 
duty, he organized two companies.</p>
          <p>I look around now and see the comforts that 
our younger generation enjoy, and think of the 
blood that was shed to make these comforts 
possible for them, and see how little some of them 
appreciate the old soldiers. My heart burns
<pb id="taylor52" n="52"/>
within me, at this want of appreciation. There 
are only a few of them left now, so let us all, as 
the ranks close, take a deeper interest in them. 
Let the younger generation take an interest also, 
and remember that it was through the efforts of 
these veterans that they and we older ones enjoy 
our liberty to-day.</p>

AFTER THE WAR</head>
          <p>IN 1866, the steamers which ran from Savannah 
to Darien would not take colored people 
unless they stayed in a certain part of the boat, 
away from the white people; so some of the 
colored citizens and ex-soldiers decided to form a 
syndicate and buy a steamer of their own. They 
finally bought a large one of a New York 
company. It arrived in fine shape, apparently, and 
made its first trip to Darien. The next trip was 
to Beaufort. I went on this trip, as the pilot, 
James Cook, was a friend of my family, and I 
thought I would enjoy the trip; and I did, 
getting back in safety. The next trip was to go to 
Florida, but it never reached there, for on the 
way down the boat ran upon St. John bar and 
went entirely to pieces. They found out afterwards 
that they had been swindled, as the boat 
was a condemned one, and the company took 
advantage of them; and as they carried no insurance 
on the boat they lost all the money they had 
invested in it. The best people of the city 
expressed great sympathy for them in their loss, as 
it promised to prove a great investment at first.</p>
          <pb id="taylor54" n="54"/>
          <p>At the close of the war, my husband and I 
returned to Savannah, a number of the comrades 
returning at the same time. A new life was 
before us now, all the old life left behind, After 
getting settled, I opened a school at my home on 
South Broad Street, now called Oglethorpe Avenue, 
as there was not any public school for negro 
children. I had twenty children at my school, 
and received one dollar a month for each pupil, 
I also had a few older ones who came at night. 
There were several other private schools besides 
mine. Mrs. Lucinda Jackson had one on the 
same street I lived on.</p>
          <p>I taught almost a year, when the Beach Institute 
opened, which took a number of my scholars, 
as this was a free school. On September 16, 1866, 
my husband, Sergeant King, died, leaving me 
soon to welcome a little stranger alone. He was 
a boss carpenter, but being just mustered out of 
the army, and the prejudice against his race 
being still too strong to insure him much work at 
his trade, he took contracts for unloading vessels, 
and hired a number of men to assist him. He 
was much respected by the citizens, and was a 
general favorite with his associates.</p>
          <p>In December, 1866, I was obliged to give up 
teaching, but in April, 1867, I opened a school 
in Liberty County, Georgia, and taught there one 
year; but country life did not agree with me, so 
I returned to the city, and Mrs. Susie Carrier 
took charge of my school.</p>
          <p>
            <figure id="ill7" entity="taylo54">
              <p>MY SCHOOLHOUSE IN SAVANNAH</p>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <pb id="taylor55" n="55"/>
          <p>On my return to Savannah, I found that the 
free school had taken all my former pupils, so I 
opened a night school, where I taught a number 
of adults. This, together with other things I 
could get to do and the assistance of my brother-in-law, 
supported me. I taught this school until 
the fall of 1868, when a free night school opened 
at the Beach Institute, and again my scholars 
left me to attend this free school. So I had to 
close my school. I put my baby with my mother 
and entered in the employ of a family, where I 
lived quite a while, but had to leave, as the work 
was too hard.</p>
          <p>In 1872 I put in a claim for my husband's 
bounty and received one hundred dollars, some of 
which I put in the Freedmen's Savings Bank. In 
the fall of 1872 I went to work for a very wealthy 
lady, Mrs. Charles Green, as laundress. In 
the spring of 1873, Mr. and Mrs. Green came North 
to Rye Beach for the summer, and as their cook 
did not care to go so far from home, I went with 
them in her place. While there, I won a prize 
for excellent cooking at a fair which the ladies 
who were summering there had held to raise 
funds to build an Episcopal Church, and Mrs. 
Green was one of the energetic workers to make 
this fair a success; and it was a success in every 
respect and a tidy sum was netted.</p>
          <p>I returned South with Mrs. Green, and soon 
after, she went to Europe. I returned to Boston
<pb id="taylor56" n="56"/>
again in 1874, through the kindness of Mrs. 
Barnard, a daughter of ex-Mayor Otis of Boston. 
She was accompanied by her husband, Mr. James 
Barnard (who was an agent for the line of 
steamers), her six children, the nurse, and 
myself. We left Savannah on the steamship Seminole, 
under Captain Matthews, and when we had 
passed Hatteras some distance, she broke her 
shaft. The captain had the sails hoisted and we 
drifted along, there being a stiff breeze, which 
was greatly in our favor. Captain Matthews said 
the nearest point he could make was Cape Henry 
Light. About noon, Mr. Barnard spied the light 
and told the captain if he would give him a boat 
and some of the crew, he would row to the light 
for help. This was done, the boat was manned 
and they put off. They made the light, then 
they made for Norfolk, which was eight miles from 
the light, and did not reach the city until eight 
o'clock that night.</p>
          <p>Next morning he returned with a tug, to tow 
us into Norfolk for repairs; but the tug was too 
small to move the steamer, so it went back for 
more help, but before it returned, a Norfolk 
steamer, on its way to Boston, stopped to see what 
was the matter with our steamer. Our trouble 
was explained to them, and almost all the passengers 
were transferred to this steamer. Mr. 
Barnard remained on the steamer, and Mrs. Barnard 
deciding to remain with him, I went aboard this
<pb id="taylor57" n="57"/>
other steamer with the rest of the passengers. 
We left them at anchor, waiting for the tugs to 
return.</p>
          <p>This accident brought back very vividly the 
time previous to this, when I was in that other 
wreck in 1864, and I wondered if they would 
reach port safe, for it is a terrible thing to be cast 
away; but on arriving in Boston, about two days 
later, I was delighted to hear of the arrival of 
their steamer at T Wharf, with all on board safe.</p>
          <p>Soon after I got to Boston, I entered the 
service of Mr. Thomas Smith's family, on Walnut 
Avenue, Boston Highlands, where I remained 
until the death of Mrs. Smith. I next lived with 
Mrs. Gorham Gray, Beacon Street, where I 
remained until I was married, in 1879, to Russell 
L. Taylor.</p>
          <p>In 1880 I had another experience in steamer 
accidents. Mr. Taylor and I started for New 
York on the steamer Stonington. We were in 
bed when, sometime in the night, the Narragansett 
collided with our boat. I was awakened by the 
crash. I was in the ladies' cabin. There were 
about thirty-five or forty others in the cabin. I 
sprang out of my berth, dressed as quickly as I 
could, and tried to reach the deck, but we found 
the cabin door locked, and two men stood outside 
and would not let us out. About twenty minutes 
after, they opened the doors and we went up on 
deck, and a terrible scene was before us. The
<pb id="taylor58" n="58"/>
Narragansett was on fire, in a bright blaze; the 
water was lighted as far as one could see, the 
passengers shrieking, groaning, running about, leaping 
into the water, panic-stricken. A steamer 
came to our assistance; they put the life-rafts off 
and saved a great many from the burning steamer, 
and picked a number up from the water. A 
colored man saved his wife and child by giving each 
a chair and having them jump overboard. These 
chairs kept them afloat until they were taken 
aboard by the life-raft. The steamer was burned 
to the water's edge. The passengers on board 
our steamer were transferred to another one and 
got to New York at 9.30 the next morning. A 
number of lives were lost in this accident, and 
the bow of the Stonington was badly damaged. 
I was thankful for my escape, for I had been in 
two similar experiences and got off safely, and I 
have come to the conclusion I shall never have a 
watery grave.</p>

THE WOMEN'S RELIEF CORPS</head>
          <p>ALL this time my interest in the boys in blue
had not abated. I was still loyal and true,
whether they were black or white. My hands
have never left undone anything they could do
towards their aid and comfort in the twilight of
their lives. In 1886 I helped to organize Corps
67, Women's Relief Corps, auxiliary to the G. A.
R., and it is a very flourishing corps to-day. I
have been Guard, Secretary, Treasurer for three
years, and in 1893 I was made President of this
corps, Mrs. Emily Clark being Department President 
this year. In 1896, in response to an order
sent out by the Department W. R. C. to take a
census to secure a complete roster of the Union
Veterans of the war of the Rebellion now residing 
in Massachusetts, I was allotted the West
End district, which (with the assistance of Mrs.
Lizzie L. Johnson, a member of Corps 67, and
widow of a soldier of the 54th Mass. Volunteers)
I canvassed with splendid success, and found a
great many comrades who were not attached to
any post in the city or State.</p>
          <p>In 1898 the Department of Mass. W. R. C.
<pb id="taylor60" n="60"/>
gave a grand fair at Music Hall. I made a large 
quilt of red, white, and blue ribbon that made 
quite a sensation. The quilt was voted for and 
was awarded to the Department President, Mrs. 
E. L. W. Waterman, of Boston.</p>

THOUGHTS ON PRESENT CONDITIONS</head>
          <p>LIVING here in Boston where the black man is 
given equal justice, I must say a word on the 
general treatment of my race, both in the North and 
South, in this twentieth century. I wonder if our 
white fellow men realize the true sense or meaning 
of brotherhood? For two hundred years we 
had toiled for them; the war of 1861 came and 
was ended, and we thought our race was forever 
freed from bondage, and that the two races could 
live in unity with each other, but when we read 
almost every day of what is being done to my race 
by some whites in the South, I sometimes ask, 
“Was the war in vain? Has it brought freedom, 
in the full sense of the word, or has it not made 
our condition more hopeless?”</p>
          <p>In this “land of the free” we are burned, 
tortured, and denied a fair trial, murdered for any 
imaginary wrong conceived in the brain of the 
negro-hating white man. There is no redress for 
us from a government which promised to protect 
all under its flag. It seems a mystery to me. 
They say, “One flag, one nation, one country 
indivisible.” Is this true? Can we say this truthfully,
<pb id="taylor62" n="62"/>
when one race is allowed to burn, hang, and 
inflict the most horrible torture weekly, monthly, 
on another? No, we cannot sing “My country,
'tis of thee, Sweet land of Liberty”! It is hollow
mockery. The Southland laws are all on the side
of the white, and they do just as they like to the
negro, whether in the right or not.</p>
          <p>I do not uphold my race when they do wrong. 
They ought to be punished, but the innocent are 
made to suffer as well as the guilty, and I hope 
the time will hasten when it will be stopped 
forever. Let us remember God says, “He that sheds 
blood, his blood shall be required again.” I may 
not live to see it, but the time is approaching when 
the South will again have cause to repent for the 
blood it has shed of innocent black men, for their 
blood cries out for vengeance. For the South still 
cherishes a hatred toward the blacks, although 
there are some true Southern gentlemen left who 
abhor the stigma brought upon them, and feel it 
very keenly, and I hope the day is not far 
distant when the two races will reside in peace in 
the Southland, and we will sing with sincere and 
truthful hearts, “My country, 't is of thee, Sweet 
land of Liberty, of thee I sing.”</p>
          <p>I have been in many States and cities, and in 
each I have looked for liberty and justice, equal 
for the black as for the white; but it was not 
until I was within the borders of New England, 
and reached old Massachusetts, that I found it.
<pb id="taylor63" n="63"/>
Here is found liberty in the full sense of the 
word, liberty for the stranger within her gates, 
irrespective of race or creed, liberty and justice 
for all.</p>
          <p>We have before us still another problem to 
solve. With the close of the Spanish war, and 
on the entrance of the Americans into Cuba, the 
same conditions confront us as the war of 1861 
left. The Cubans are free, but it is a limited 
freedom, for prejudice, deep-rooted, has been 
brought to them and a separation made between 
the white and black Cubans, a thing that had 
never existed between them before; but to-day 
there is the same intense hatred toward the 
negro in Cuba that there is in some parts of this 
country.</p>
          <p>I helped to furnish and pack boxes to be sent 
to the soldiers and hospitals during the first part 
of the Spanish war; there were black soldiers 
there too. At the battle of San Juan Hill, they 
were in the front, just as brave, loyal, and true 
as those other black men who fought for freedom 
and the right; and yet their bravery and 
faithfulness were reluctantly acknowledged, and 
praise grudgingly given. All we ask for is 
“equal justice,” the same that is accorded to all 
other races who come to this country, of their 
free will (not forced to, as we were), and are 
allowed to enjoy every privilege, unrestricted, 
while we are denied what is rightfully our own
<pb id="taylor64" n="64"/>
in a country which the labor of our forefathers 
helped to make what it is.</p>
          <p>One thing I have noticed among my people in 
the South: they have accumulated a large amount 
of real estate, far surpassing the colored owners 
in the North, who seem to let their opportunity 
slip by them. Nearly all of Brownsville (a suburb 
of Savannah) is owned by colored people, 
and so it is in a great many other places throughout 
the State, and all that is needed is the 
protection of the law as citizens.</p>
          <p>In 1867, soon after the death of my father, 
who had served on a gunboat during the war, 
my mother opened a grocery store, where she 
kept general merchandise always on hand. These 
she traded for cash or would exchange for crops 
of cotton, corn, or rice, which she would ship once 
a month, to F. Lloyd&amp;Co., or Johnson&amp; 
Jackson, in Savannah. These were colored 
merchants, doing business on Bay Street in that city. 
Mother bought her first property, which contained 
ten acres. She next purchased fifty acres of land. 
Then she had a chance to get a place with seven 
hundred acres of land, and she bought this.</p>
          <p>In 1870, Colonel Hamilton and Major Devendorft, 
of Oswego, N. Y., came to the town and 
bought up a tract of land at a place called 
Doctortown, and started a mill. Mrs. Devendorft
heard of my mother and went to see her, and 
persuaded her to come to live with her, assuring her
<pb id="taylor65" n="65"/>
she would be as one of the family. Mother went 
with her, but after a few months she went to 
Doctortown, where she has been since, and now 
owns the largest settlement there. All trains 
going to Florida pass her place, just across the 
Altamaha River. She is well known by both 
white and black; the people are fond of her, and 
will not allow any one to harm her.</p>
          <p>Mr. Devendorft sold out his place in 1880 and 
went back to New York, where later he died.</p>
          <p>I read an article, which said the ex-Confederate 
Daughters had sent a petition to the managers 
of the local theatres in Tennessee to prohibit 
the performance of “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” claiming 
it was exaggerated (that is, the treatment of 
the slaves), and would have a very bad effect on 
the children who might see the drama. I paused 
and thought back a few years of the heart-rending 
scenes I have witnessed; I have seen many 
times, when I was a mere girl, thirty or forty 
men, handcuffed, and as many women and 
children, come every first Tuesday of each month 
from Mr. Wiley's trade office to the auction 
blocks, one of them being situated on Drayton 
Street and Court Lane, the other on Bryant 
Street, near the Pulaski House. The route was 
down our principal street, Bull Street, to the 
courthouse, which was only a block from where 
I resided.</p>
          <p>All people in those days got all their water
<pb id="taylor66" n="66"/>
from the city pumps, which stood about a block 
apart throughout the city. The one we used to 
get water from was opposite the court-house, on 
Bull Street. I remember, as if it were yesterday, 
seeing droves of negroes going to be sold, and I 
often went to look at them, and I could hear the 
auctioneer very plainly from my house, auctioning 
these poor people off.</p>
          <p>Do these Confederate Daughters ever send 
petitions to prohibit the atrocious lynchings and 
wholesale murdering and torture of the negro? 
Do you ever hear of them fearing this would have 
a bad effect on the children? Which of these 
two, the drama or the present state of affairs, 
makes a degrading impression upon the minds of 
our young generation? In my opinion it is not 
“Uncle Tom's Cabin,” but it should be the one 
that has caused the world to cry “Shame!” 
It does not seem as if our land is yet civilized. 
It is like times long past, when rulers and high 
officers had to flee for their lives, and the negro 
has been dealt with in the same way since the 
war by those he lived with and toiled for two 
hundred years or more. I do not condemn all 
the Caucasian race because the negro is badly 
treated by a few of the race. No! for had it not 
been for the true whites, assisted by God and the 
prayers of our forefathers, I should not be here 
to-day.</p>
          <p>There are still good friends to the negro.
<pb id="taylor67" n="67"/>
Why, there are still thousands that have not 
bowed to Baal. So it is with us. Man thinks two 
hundred years is a long time, and it is, too; but 
it is only as a week to God, and in his own time 
—I know I shall not live to see the day, but it 
will come—the South will be like the North, and 
when it comes it will be prized higher than we
prize the North to-day. God is just; when he 
created man he made him in his image, and never 
intended one should misuse the other. All men 
are born free and equal in his sight.</p>
          <p>I am pleased to know at this writing that the 
officers and comrades of my regiment stand ready 
to render me assistance whenever required. It 
seems like “bread cast upon the water,” and it has 
returned after many days, when it is most needed. 
I have received letters from some of the 
comrades, since we parted in 1866, with expressions 
of gratitude and thanks to me for teaching them 
their first letters. One of them, Peter Waggall, 
is a minister in Jacksonville, Fla. Another is 
in the government service at Washington, D. C. 
Others are in Darien and Savannah, Ga., and 
all are doing well.</p>
          <p>There are many people who do not know what 
some of the colored women did during the war. 
There were hundreds of them who assisted the 
Union soldiers by hiding them and helping them 
to escape. Many were punished for taking food 
to the prison stockades for the prisoners. When I
<pb id="taylor68" n="68"/>
went into Savannah, in 1805, I was told of one of 
these stockades which was in the suburbs of the 
city, and they said it was an awful place. The 
Union soldiers were in it, worse than pigs, without 
any shelter from sun or storm, and the colored 
women would take food there at night and pass it 
to them, through the holes in the fence. The 
soldiers were starving, and these women did all they 
could towards relieving those men, although they 
knew the penalty, should they be caught giving 
them aid. Others assisted in various ways the 
Union army. These things should be kept in 
history before the people. There has never been 
a greater war in the United States than the one 
of 1861, where so many lives were lost,—not men 
alone but noble women as well.</p>
          <p>Let us not forget that terrible war, or our 
brave soldiers who were thrown into Andersonville 
and Libby prisons, the awful agony they 
went through, and the most brutal treatment they 
received in those loathsome dens, the worst ever 
given human beings; and if the white soldiers 
were subjected to such treatment, what must have 
been the horrors inflicted on the negro soldiers 
in their prison pens? Can we forget those cruelties? 
No, though we try to forgive and say, 
“No North, no South,” and hope to see it in reality 
before the last comrade passes away.</p>

<lb/>
A VISIT TO LOUISIANA</head>
          <p>THE inevitable always happens. On February 
3, 1898, I was called to Shreveport, La., to 
the bedside of my son, who was very ill. He 
was traveling with Nickens and Company, with 
“The Lion's Bride,” when he fell ill, and had 
been ill two weeks when they sent to me. I tried 
to have him brought home to Boston, but they 
could not send him, as he was not able to sit and 
ride this long distance; so on the sixth of 
February I left Boston to go to him. I reached 
Cincinnati on the eighth, where I took the train for 
the south. I asked a white man standing near 
(before I got my train) what car I should take. 
“Take that one,” he said, pointing to one. “But 
that is a smoking car!” “Well,” he replied, 
“that is the car for colored people.” I went to this 
car, and on entering it all my courage failed me. I 
have ridden in many coaches, but I was never in 
such as these. I wanted to return home again, but 
when I thought of my sick boy I said, “Well, 
others ride in these cars and I must do likewise,” 
and tried to be resigned, for I wanted to reach 
my boy, as I did not know whether I should find
<pb id="taylor70" n="70"/>
him alive. I arrived in Chattanooga at eight 
o'clock in the evening, where the porter took my 
baggage to the train which was to leave for
Marion, Miss. Soon after I was seated, just 
before the train pulled out, two tall men with 
slouch hats on walked through the car, and on 
through the train. Finally they came back to 
our car and stopping at my seat said, “Where 
are those men who were with you?” I did not 
know to whom they were speaking, as there was 
another woman in the car, so I made no reply. 
Again they asked me, standing directly in front 
of my seat, “Where are those men who came 
in with you?” “Are you speaking to me?” I
said. “Yes!” they said. “I have not seen any 
men,” I replied. They looked at me a moment, 
and one of them asked where I was from. I 
told him Boston; he hesitated a minute and 
walked out of our car to the other car.</p>
          <p>When the conductor came around I told him 
what these men had said, and asked him if they 
allowed persons to enter the car and insult 
passengers. He only smiled. Later, when the porter 
came in, I mentioned it to him. He said, “Lady, 
I see you do not belong here; where are you 
from?” I told him. He said, “I have often heard 
of Massachusetts. I want to see that place.” 
“Yes!” I said, “you can ride there on the cars, 
and no person would be allowed to speak to you 
as those men did to me.” He explained that those
<pb n="71"/>
men were constables, who were in search of a 
man who had eloped with another man's wife. 
“That is the way they do here. Each morning 
you can hear of some negro being lynched;” and 
on seeing my surprise, he said, “Oh, that is 
nothing; it is done all the time. We have no rights 
here. I have been on this road for fifteen years 
and have seen some terrible things.” He wanted 
to know what I was doing down there, and I told 
him it was only the illness of my son that brought 
me there.</p>
          <p>I was a little surprised at the way the poor 
whites were made to ride on this road. They put 
them all together by themselves in a car, between 
the colored people's coach and the first-class coach, 
and it looked like the “laborers' car” used in 
Boston to carry the different day laborers to and 
from their work.</p>
          <p>I got to Marion, Miss., at two o'clock in the 
morning, arrived at Vicksburg at noon, and at 
Shreveport about eight o'clock in the evening, 
and found my son just recovering from a severe 
hemorrhage. He was very anxious to come home, 
and I tried to secure a berth for him on a sleeper, 
but they would not sell me one, and he was not 
strong enough to travel otherwise. If I could only 
have gotten him to Cincinnati, I might have 
brought him home, but as I could not I was forced 
to let him remain where he was. It seemed very 
hard, when his father fought to protect the Union
<pb id="taylor72" n="72"/>
and our flag, and yet his boy was denied, under this 
same flag, a berth to carry him home to die, 
because he was a negro.</p>
          <p>Shreveport is a little town, made, up largely of 
Jews and Germans find a few Southerners, the 
negroes being in the majority. Its sidewalks are 
sand except on the main street. Almost all the 
stores are kept either by the Jews or Germans. 
They know a stranger in a minute, as the town is 
small and the citizens know each other; if not 
personally, their faces are familiar.</p>
          <p>I went into a jewelry store one day to have a 
crystal put in my watch, and the attendant 
remarked, “You are a stranger.” I asked him 
how he knew that. He said he had watched me 
for a week or so. I told him yes, I was a stranger 
and from Boston. “Oh! I have heard of 
Boston,” he said. “You will not find this place like 
it is there. How do you like this town?” “Not 
very well,” I replied.</p>
          <p>I found that the people who had lived in 
Massachusetts and were settled in Shreveport were 
very cordial to me and glad to see me. There 
was a man murdered in cold blood for nothing. 
He was a colored man and a “porter” in a store 
in this town. A clerk had left his umbrella at 
home. It had begun to rain when he started for 
home, and on looking for the umbrella he could 
not, of course, find it. He asked the porter if he 
had seen it. He said no, he had not. “You
<pb id="taylor73" n="73"/>
answer very saucy,” said the clerk, and drawing 
his revolver, he shot the colored man dead. He 
was taken up the street to an office where he was 
placed under one thousand dollars bond for his 
appearance and released, and that was the end of 
the case. I was surprised at this, but I was told 
by several white and colored persons that this was 
a common occurrence, and the persons were never 
punished if they were white, but no mercy was 
shown to negroes.</p>
          <p>I met several comrades, white and colored, there, 
and noticed that the colored comrades did not 
wear their buttons. I asked one of them why this 
was, and was told, should they wear it, they could 
not get work. Still some would wear their 
buttons in spite of the feeling against it. I met a 
newsman from New York on the train. He was 
a veteran, and said that Sherman ought to come 
back and go into that part of the country.</p>
          <p>Shreveport is a horrid place when it rains. 
The earth is red and sticks to your shoes, and it 
is impossible to keep rubbers on, for the mud pulls 
them off. Going across the Mississippi River, I 
was amazed to see how the houses were built, so 
close to the shore, or else on low land; and when 
the river rises, it flows into these houses and must 
make it very disagreeable and unhealthy for the 
inmates.</p>
          <p>After the death of my son, while on my way 
back to Boston, I came to Clarksdale, one of the
<pb id="taylor74" n="74"/>
stations on the road from Vicksburg. In this 
town a Mr. Hancock, of New York, had a large 
cotton plantation, and the Chinese intermarry 
with the blacks.</p>
          <p>At Clarksdale, I saw a man hanged. It was a 
terrible sight, and I felt alarmed for my own 
safety down there. When I reached Memphis I 
found conditions of travel much better. The people 
were mostly Western and Northern here; the 
cars were nice, but separate for colored persons 
until we reached the Ohio River, when the door 
was opened and the porter passed through, saying, 
“The Ohio River! change to the other car.” 
I thought, “What does he mean? We have been 
riding all this distance in separate cars, and now 
we are all to sit together.” It certainly seemed 
a peculiar arrangement. Why not let the 
negroes, if their appearance and respectability 
warrant it, be allowed to ride as they do in the North, 
East, or West?</p>
          <p>There are others beside the blacks, in the South 
and North, that should be put in separate cars 
while traveling, just as they put my race. Many 
black people in the South do not wish to be 
thrown into a car because all are colored, as there 
are many of their race very objectionable to them, 
being of an entirely different class; but they have 
to adapt themselves to the circumstances and 
ride with them, because they are all negroes. 
There is no such division with the whites. Except
<pb id="taylor75" n="75"/>
in one place I saw, the workingman and the 
millionaire ride in the same coaches together. Why 
not allow the respectable, law-abiding classes of 
the blacks the same privilege? We hope for 
better conditions in the future, and feel sure 
they will come in time, surely if slowly.</p>
          <p>While in Shreveport, I visited ex-Senator 
Harper's house. He is a colored man and owns 
a large business block, besides a fine residence 
on Cado Street and several good building lots. 
Another family, the Pages, living on the same
street, were quite wealthy, and a large number
of colored families owned their homes, and were
industrious, refined people; and if they were only
allowed justice, the South would be the only place
for our people to live.</p>
          <p>We are similar to the children of Israel, who, 
after many weary years in bondage, were led 
into that land of promise, there to thrive and 
be forever free from persecution; and I don't 
despair, for the Book which is our guide through 
life declares, “Ethiopia shall stretch forth her 
hand.”</p>
          <p>What a wonderful revolution! In 1861 the
Southern papers were full of advertisements for
“slaves,” but now, despite all the hindrances
and “race problems,” my people are striving to
attain the full standard of all other races born
free in the sight of God, and in a number of 
instances have succeeded. Justice we ask,—to be
<pb id="taylor76" n="76"/>
citizens of these United States, where so many of
our people have shed their blood with their white
comrades, that the stars and stripes should never
be polluted.</p>
