        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>THE author of this work was frequently urged
by friends to write,
for publication, something that
would present a view of the writer's
early life, as well as give some of
her methods of imparting the intellectual 
and moral instruction that has proved so eminently 
successful in influencing and moulding so many
lives.</p>
        <p>After much persuasion, the work was begun, and carried
forward to its present stage.</p>
        <p>The final work of editing and directing its publication
has fallen into other hands, and however inefficiently done, is
a loving service, willingly performed, and sent forth with a
hope that it may accomplish much good, especially in the way
of inspiring those readers who are anxious to make the most of
their opportunities.</p>

          <head>AUTOBIOGRAPHY: A SKETCH.</head>
          <p>THERE are some few points in my life which,
  “some forlorn and shipwrecked brother
seeing, may take heart again.”</p>
          <p>We used to call our grandmother  “mammy,” and one of
my earliest recollections—I must have been about three years
old—is, I was sent to keep my mammy company. It was in a
little one-room cabin. We used to go up a ladder to the loft
where we slept.</p>
          <p>Mammy used to make a long prayer every night before
going to bed; but not one word of all she said do I remember
except the one word  “offspring.” She would ask God to bless
her offspring. This word remained with me, for, I wondered
what offspring meant.</p>
          <p>Mammy had six children, three boys and three girls. One
of these, Lucy, was my mother. Another one of them, Sarah,
was purchased by my grandfather, who first saved money and
bought himself, then four of his children. Sarah went to work
at six dollars a
<pb id="coppin10" n="10"/>
month, saved one hundred and twenty-five dollars, and
bought little Frances, having taken a great liking to her, for on
account of my birth, my grandfather refused to buy my mother;
and so I was left a slave in the District of Columbia, where I
was born.</p>
          <p>In my childhood, I had two severe burnings. I understand
that at my christening the old folks gave a large party, and I
was tied in a chair and placed near the stove. At night, when
they took off my stocking, the whole skin from the side of the
leg next the stove peeled off.</p>
          <p>At another time, when mother was out at work for the
day, mammy had charge of the baby. When mother returned,
mammy exclaimed:  “Here, Lucy, take your child, it's the
crossest baby I ever saw.” When I was undressed at night, it
was found that a coal of fire from mammy's pipe had fallen into
the baby's bosom, and had burned itself deep into the flesh.
There were no Day Nurseries then.</p>
          <p>Passing over years, I distinctly remember having chills
and fever. Sometimes I would be taken with a shaking ague on
the street, and would have to sit down upon a doorstep until I
would stop shaking enough to go on my way. Then, I would
have to go to bed, as I could not endure the fever and
headache that would follow. When my aunt had finally saved
up the hundred and twenty-five dollars, she bought me and
sent me to New Bedford, Mass., where another aunt lived, who
promised to get me a place to work for my board, and get a
little education if I could. She put
<pb id="coppin11" n="11"/>
out to work, at a place where I was allowed to go to school
when I was not at work. But I could not go on wash day, nor
ironing day, nor cleaning day, and  this interfered with my
progress. There were  no Hamptons, and no night schools then.</p>
          <p>Finally, I found a chance to go to Newport with Mrs.  Elizabeth
Orr, an aunt by marriage, who offered me a home with her and a
better chance at school. I went with her, but I was not satisfied
to be a burden on her small resources. I was now fourteen years
old, and felt that I ought to take care of myself. So I found 
a permanent place in the family of Mr. George H. Calvert, a
great grandson of Lord Baltimore, who settled Maryland.
His wife was Elizabeth Stuart, a descendant of Mary, Queen
of Scots. Here I had one hour every other afternoon in the
week to take some private lessons, which I did of Mrs. Little.
After that, attended for a few months the public colored
school which was taught by Mrs. Gavitt. I thus prepared
myself to enter the examination for the Rhode Island State
Normal School, under Dana P. Colburn; the school was then
located at Bristol, R. I. Here, my eyes were first opened on the
subject of teaching. I said to myself, is it possible that
teaching can be made so interesting as this! But, having
finished the course of study there, I felt that I had just begun
to learn; and, hearing of Oberlin College, I made up my
mind to try and get there. I had learned a little music while
at Newport, and had mastered the elementary studies of
the piano and guitar. My aunt in Washington still
<pb id="coppin12" n="12"/>
helped me, and I was able to pay my way to Oberlin, the
course of study there being the same as that at Harvard
College. Oberlin was then the only College in the United States
where colored students were permitted to study.</p>
          <p>The faculty did not forbid a woman to take the
gentleman's course, but they did not advise it. There was
plenty of Latin and Greek in it, and as much mathematics as one
could shoulder. Now, I took a long breath and prepared for a
delightful contest. All went smoothly until I was in the junior
year in College. Then, one day, the Faculty sent for me—ominous
request—and I was not slow in obeying it. It was a custom in
Oberlin that forty students from the junior and senior classes
were employed to teach the preparatory classes. As it was now
time for the juniors to begin their work, the Faculty informed me
that it was their purpose to give me a class, but I was to
distinctly understand that if the pupils rebelled against my
teaching, they did not intend to force it. Fortunately for my
training at the normal school, and my own dear love of
teaching, tho there was a little surprise on the faces of some
when they came into the class, and saw the teacher, there were
no signs of rebellion. The class went on increasing in numbers
until it had to be divided, and I was given both divisions. One
of the divisions ran up again, but the Faculty decided that I
had as much as I could do, and it would not allow me to take
any more work.</p>
          <pb id="copppin13" n="13"/>
          <p>When I was within a year of graduation, an application came
from a Friends' school in Philadelphia for a colored woman
who could teach Greek, Latin, and higher mathematics.
The answer returned was:  “We have the woman, but you
must wait a year for her.”</p>
          <p>Then began a correspondence with Alfred Cope, a
saintly character, who, having found out what my work in
college was, teaching my classes in college, besides sixteen
private music scholars, and keeping up my work in the senior
class, immediately sent me a check for eighty dollars, which
wonderfully lightened my burden as a poor student.</p>
          <p>I shall never forget my obligation to Bishop Daniel A.
Payne, of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, who gave
me a scholarship of nine dollars a year upon entering Oberlin.</p>
          <p>My obligation to the dear people of Oberlin can never be
measured in words. When President Finney met a new
student, his first words were:  “Are you a Christian? and if not,
why not?” He would follow you up with an intelligent
persistence that could not be resisted, until the question was
settled.</p>
          <p>When I first went to Oberlin I boarded in what was
known as the Ladies' Hall, and altho the food was good, yet, I
think, that for lack of variety I began to run down in health.
About this time I was invited to spend a few weeks in the
family of Professor H. E. Peck, which ended in my staying a
few years, until the independence of the Republic of Hayti was
recognized,
<pb id="coppin14" n="14"/>
under President Lincoln, and Professor Peck was sent as the
first U. S. Minister to that interesting country; then the family
was broken up, and I was invited by Professor and Mrs.
Charles H. Churchill to spend the remainder of my time, about
six months, in their family. The influence upon my life in these
two Christian homes, where I was regarded as an honored
member of the family circle, was a potent factor in forming the
character which was to stand the test of the new and strange
conditions of my life in Philadelphia. I had been so long in
Oberlin that I had forgotten about my color, but I was sharply
reminded of it when, in a storm of rain, a Philadelphia street car
conductor forbid my entering a car that did not have on it  “for
colored people,” so I had to wait in the storm until one came in
which colored people could ride. This was my first unpleasant
experience in Philadelphia. Visiting Oberlin not long after my
work began in Philadelphia, President Finney asked me how I
was growing in grace; I told him that I was growing as fast as
the American people would let me. When told of some of the
conditions which were meeting me, he seemed to think it
unspeakable.</p>
          <p>At one time, at Mrs. Peck's, when we girls were sitting on
the floor getting out our Greek, Miss Sutherland, from Maine,
suddenly stopped, and, looking at me, said:  “Fanny Jackson,
were you ever a slave?” I said yes; and she burst into tears.
Not another word was spoken by us. But those tears seemed
to wipe out a little of what was wrong.</p>
          <pb id="coppin15" n="15"/>
          <p>I never rose to recite in my classes at Oberlin but I felt
that I had the honor of the whole African race upon my
shoulders. I felt that, should I fail, it would be ascribed to the
fact that I was colored. At one time, when I had quite a signal
triumph in Greek, the Professor of Greek concluded to visit the
class in mathematics and see how we were getting along. I was
particularly anxious to show him that I was as safe in
mathematics as in Greek.</p>
          <p>I, indeed, was more anxious, for I had always heard that
my race was good in the languages, but stumbled when they
came to mathematics. Now, I was always fond of a
demonstration, and happened to get in the examination the
very proposition that I was well acquainted with; and so went
that day out of the class with flying colors.</p>
          <p>I was elected class poet for the Class Day exercises, and
have the kindest remembrance of the dear ones who were my
classmates. I never can forget the courtesies of the three
Wright brothers; of Professor Pond, of Dr. Lucien C. Warner,
of Doctor Kincaid, the Chamberland girls, and others, who
seemed determined that I should carry away from Oberlin
nothing but most pleasant memories of my life there.</p>
          <p>Recurring to my tendency to have shaking agues every
fall and spring in Washington, I often used to tell my aunt that
if she bought me according to my weight, she certainly had
made a very poor bargain. For I was not only as slim as a
match, but, as the Irishman said, I was as slim as two matches.</p>
          <pb id="coppin16" n="16"/>
          <p>While I was living with Mrs. Calvert at Newport, R. I., I
went with her regularly to bathe in the ocean, and after this I
never had any more shakes or chills. It was contrary to law for
colored persons to bathe at the regular bathing hour, which
was the only safe hour to go into the ocean, but, being in the
employ of Mrs. Calvert, and going as her servant, I was not
prohibited from taking the baths which proved so beneficial to
me. She went and returned in her carriage.</p>
          <p>After this I began to grow stronger, and take on flesh.
Mrs. Calvert sometimes took me out to drive with her; this also
helped me to get stronger.</p>
          <p>Being very fond of music, my aunt gave me permission to
hire a piano and have it at her house, and I used to go there
and take lessons. But, in the course of time, it became
noticeable to Mrs. Calvert that I was absent on Wednesdays
at a certain hour, and that without permission. So, on one
occasion, when I was absent, Mrs. Calvert inquired of the cook
as to my whereabouts, and directed her to send me to her upon
my return that I might give an explanation. When the cook
informed me of what had transpired, I was very much afraid
that something quite unpleasant awaited me. Upon being
questioned, I told her the whole truth about the matter. I told
Mrs. Calvert that I had been taking lessons for some time, and
that I had already advanced far enough to play the little organ
in the Union Church. Instead of being terribly scolded, as I had
feared, Mrs. Calvert said:  “Well, Fanny, when people will go
ahead, they cannot be kept
<pb id="coppin17" n="17"/>
back; but, if you had asked me, you might have had the piano
here.” Mrs. Calvert taught me to sew beautifully and to darn,
and to take care of laces. My life there was most happy, and I
never would have left her, but it was in me to get an education
and to teach my people. This idea was deep in my soul. Where
it came from I cannot tell, for I had never had any exhortations,
nor any lectures which influenced me to take this course. It
must have been born in me. At Mrs. Calvert's, I was in contact
with people of refinement and education. Mr. Calvert was a
perfect gentleman, and a writer of no mean ability. They had no
children, and this gave me an opportunity to come very near to
Mrs. Calvert, doing for her many things which otherwise a
daughter would have done. I loved her and she loved me.
When I was about to leave her to go to the Normal School, she
said to me:  “Fanny, will money keep you?” But that 
deep-seated purpose to get an education and become a teacher to
my people, yielded to no inducement of comfort or temporary
gain. During the time that I attended the Normal School in
Rhode Island, I got a chance to take some private lessons in
French, and eagerly availed myself of the opportunity. French
was not in the Oberlin curriculum, but there was a professor
there who taught it privately, and I continued my studies under
him, and so was able to complete the course and graduate with
a French essay. Freedmen now began to pour into Ohio from
the South, and some of them settled in the township of Oberlin.
During my last year at the college,
<pb id="coppin18" n="18"/>
I formed an evening class for them, where they might be
taught to read and write. It was deeply touching to me to see
old men painfully following the simple words of spelling; so
intensely eager to learn. I felt that for such people to have
been kept in the darkness of ignorance was an unpardonable
sin, and I rejoiced that even then I could enter measurably
upon the course in life which I had long ago chosen. Mr. John
M. Langston, who afterwards became Minister to Hayti, was
then practicing law at Oberlin. His comfortable home was
always open with a warm welcome to colored students, or to
any who cared to share his hospitality.</p>
          <p>I went to Oberlin in 1860, and was graduated in August,
1865, after having spent five and a half years.</p>
          <p>The years 1860 and 1865 were years of unusual historic
importance and activity. In '60 the immortal Lincoln was
elected, and in '65 the terrible war came to a close, but not until
freedom for all the slaves in America had been proclaimed, and
that proclamation made valid by the victorious arms of the
Union party. In the year 1863 a very bitter feeling was exhibited
against the colored people of the country, because they were
held responsible for the fratricidal war then going on. The riots
in New York especially gave evidence of this ill feeling. It was
in this year that the faculty put me to teaching.</p>
          <p>Of the thousands then coming to Oberlin for an
education, a very few were colored. I knew that, with the
exception of one here or there, all my pupils would
<pb id="coppin19" n="19"/>
be white; and so they were. It took a little moral courage on
the part of the faculty to put me in my 
place against the old custom of giving classes only to white
students. But, as I have said elsewhere, the matter was soon
settled and became an overwhelming success. How well do I
remember the delighted look on the face of Principal Fairchild
when he came into the room to divide my class, which then
numbered over eighty. How easily a colored teacher might be
put into some of the public schools. It would only take a little
bravery, and might cause a little surprise, but wouldn't be even
a nine days' wonder.</p>
          <p>And now came the time for me to leave Oberlin, and start
in upon my work at Philadelphia.</p>
          <p>In the year 1837, the Friends of Philadelphia had
established a school for the education of colored youth in
higher learning. To make a test whether or not the Negro was
capable of acquiring any considerable degree of education. For
it was one of the strongest arguments in the defense of
slavery, that the Negro was an inferior creation; formed by the
Almighty for just the work he was doing. It is said that John C.
Calhoun made the remark, that if there could be found a Negro
that could conjugate a Greek verb, he would give up all his
preconceived ideas of the inferiority of the Negro. Well, let's
try him, and see, said the fair-minded Quaker people. And for
years this institution, known as the Institute for Colored
Youth, was visited by interested persons from different parts
of the United States and Europe. Here I was given the
delightful
<pb id="coppin20" n="20"/>
task of teaching my own people, and how delighted I was to
see them mastering Caesar, Virgil, Cicero, Horace and
Xenophon's Anabasis. We also taught New Testament Greek.
It was customary to have public examinations once a year, and
when the teachers were thru examining their classes, any
interested person in the audience was requested to take it up,
and ask questions. At one of such examinations, when I asked
a titled Englishman to take the class and examine it, he said:
  “They are more capable of examining me, their proficiency is
simply wonderful.”</p>
          <p>One visiting friend was so pleased with the work of the
students in the difficult metres in Horace that he afterwards
sent me, as a present, the Horace which he used in college. A
learned Friend from Germantown, coming into a class in Greek,
the first aorist, passive and middle, being so neatly and
correctly written at one board, while I, at the same time, was
hearing a class recite, exclaimed:  “Fanny, I find thee driving a
coach and six.” As it is much more difficult to drive a coach
and six, than a coach and one, I took it as a compliment. But I
was especially glad to know that the students were doing their
work so well as to justify Quakers in their fair-minded opinion
of them. General O. C. Howard, who was brought in at one time
by one of the managers to hear an examination in Virgil,
remarked that Negroes in trigonometry and the classics might
well share in the triumphs of their brothers on the battlefield.</p>
          <p>When I came to the School, the Principal of the
<pb id="coppin21" n="21"/>
Institute was Ebenezer D. Bassett, who for fourteen years had
charge of the work. He was a graduate of the State Normal
School of Connecticut, and was a man of unusual natural and
acquired ability, and an accurate and ripe scholar; and, withal,
a man of great modesty of character. Many are the
reminiscences he used to give of the visits of interested
persons to the school: among these was a man who had
written a book to prove that the Negro was not a man. And,
having heard of the wonderful achievements of this Negro
school, he determined to come and see for himself what was
being accomplished. He brought a friend with him, better
versed in algebra than himself, and asked Mr. Bassett to bring
out his highest class. There was in the class at that time Jesse
Glasgow, a very black boy. All he asked was a chance. Just as
fast as they gave the problems, Jesse put them on the board
with the greatest ease. This decided the fate of the book, then
in manuscript form, which, so far as we know, was never
published. Jesse Glasgow afterwards found his way to the
University of Edinburgh, Scotland.</p>
          <p>In the year 1869, Mr. Bassett was appointed United
States Minister to Hayti by President Grant; leaving the
principalship of the Institute vacant. Now, Octavius V. Catto, a
professor in the school, and myself, had an opportunity to
keep the school up to the same degree of proficiency that it
attained under its former Principal and to carry it forward as
much as possible.</p>
          <pb id="coppin22" n="22"/>
          <p>About this time we were visited by a delegation of school
commissioners, seeking teachers for schools in Delaware,
Maryland and New Jersey. These teachers were not required
to know and teach the classics, but they were expected to
come into an examination upon the English branches, and to
have at their tongue's end the solution of any abstruse
problem in the three R's which their examiners might be
inclined to ask them. And now, it seemed best to give up the
time spent in teaching Greek and devote it to the English
studies.</p>
          <p>As our young people were now about to find a ready field
in teaching, it was thought well to introduce some text books
on school management, and methods of teaching, and
thoroughly prepare our students for normal work. At this time
our faculty was increased by the addition of Richard T.
Greener, a graduate of Harvard College, who took charge of the
English Department, and Edward Bouchet, a graduate of Yale
College, and also of the Sheffield Scientific School, who took
charge of the scientific department. Both of these young men
were admirably fitted for their work. And, with Octavius V.
Catto in charge of the boys' department, and myself in charge
of the girls—in connection with the principalship of the
school—we had a strong working force.</p>
          <p>I now instituted a course in normal training, which at first
consisted only of a review of English studies, with the theory
of teaching, school management and methods. But the
inadequacy of this course was so
<pb id="coppin23" n="23"/>
apparent that when it became necessary to reorganize the
Preparatory Departments, it was decided to put this work into
the hands of the normal students, who would thus have ample
practice in teaching and governing under daily direction and
correction. These students became so efficient in their work
that they were sought for and engaged to teach long before
they finished their course of study.</p>
          <p>Richard Humphreys, the Friend—Quaker—who gave the
first endowment with which to found the school, stipulated
that it should not only teach higher literary studies, but that a
Mechanical and Industrial Department, including Agriculture,
should come within the scope of its work. The wisdom of this
thoughtful and far-seeing founder has since been amply
demonstrated. At the Centennial Exhibition in 1876, the foreign
exhibits of work done in trade schools opened the eyes of the
directors of  public education in America as to the great lack
existing in our own system of education. If this deficiency was
apparent as it related to the white youth of the country, it was
far more so as it related to the colored.</p>
          <p>In Philadelphia, the only place at the time where a colored
boy could learn a trade, was in the House of Refuge, or the
Penitentiary!</p>
          <p>And now began an eager and intensely earnest crusade
to supply this deficiency in the work of the Institute for
Colored Youth.</p>
          <p>The teachers of the Institute now vigorously applied their
energies in collecting funds for the establishment
<pb id="coppin24" n="24"/>
of an Industrial Department, and in this work they
had the encouragement of the managers of the school, who
were as anxious as we that the greatly needed department
should be established. </p>
          <p>In instituting this department, a temporary organization
was formed, with Mr. Theodore Starr as President, Miss Anna
Hallowell as Treasurer, and myself as Field Agent.</p>
          <p>The Academic Department of the Institute had been so
splendidly successful in proving that the Negro youth was
equally capable as others in mastering a higher education, that
no argument was necessary to establish its need, but the
broad ground of education by which the masses must become
self-supporting was, to me, a matter of painful anxiety.
Frederick Douglass once said, it was easier to get a colored
boy into a lawyer's office than into a blacksmith shop; and on
account of the inflexibility of the Trades Unions, this condition
of affairs still continues, making it necessary for us to have our
own  “blacksmith shop.”</p>
          <p>The minds of our people had to be enlightened upon the
necessity of industrial education.</p>
          <p>Before all the literary societies and churches where they
would hear me; in Philadelphia and the suburban towns; in
New York, Washington and everywhere, when invited to
speak, I made that one subject my theme. To equip an
industrial plant is an expensive thing, and knowing that much
money would be needed, I made it a rule to take up a collection
wheresoever I spoke. But I did not urge anyone to give more
than
<pb id="coppin25" n="25"/>
a dollar, for the reason I wanted the masses to have an
opportunity to contribute their small offerings, before going to
those who were able to give larger sums. Never shall I forget
the encouragement given me when a colored man, whom I did
not know, met me and said:  “I have heard of your Industrial
School project, come to me for twenty-five dollars. That man
was Walter P. Hall; all honor to him.</p>
          <p>In preparing for the industrial needs of the boys, the girls
were not neglected. It was not difficult to find competent
teachers of sewing and cooking for the girls.</p>
          <p>Dressmaking on the Taylor system was introduced with
great success, and cooking was taught by the most improved
methods.</p>
          <p>As the work advanced, other trades were added, and
those already undertaken were expanded and perfected.</p>
          <p>When the Industrial Department was fully established,
the following trades were being taught: For boys: bricklaying,
plastering, carpentry, shoemaking, printing and tailoring. For
the girls: dressmaking, millinery, typewriting, stenography and
classes in cooking, including both boys and girls.
Stenography and typewriting were also taught the boys, as
well as the girls.</p>
          <p>Having taught certain trades, it was now necessary to
find work for those who had learned them, which proved to be
no easy task.</p>
          <p>It was decided to put on exhibition, in one of the
<pb id="coppin26" n="26"/>
rooms of the dormitory, specimens of the work of our girls in
any trade in which they had become proficient, and we thus
started an Industrial Exchange for their work. Those specimens
consisted of work from the sewing, millinery and cooking
departments.</p>
          <p>In order to get the work of the Exchange more
prominently before our people, I asked and obtained
permission to hold some public exhibitions of it in the lecture
rooms of the churches.</p>
          <p>Those who sent their work to the Exchange were asked to
send articles that would be salable.</p>
          <p>Our white friends were invited to come and inspect the
work of the Exchange. Some of the exhibits were found to be
highly creditable, and many encouraging words were given to
those who prepared them. There is one class of women, for
whom no trades are provided, but who are expected to do their
work without any special preparation; and these are the women
in domestic service. I have always felt a deep sympathy with
such persons, for I believe that they are capable of making a
most honorable record. I therefore conceived a pan of holding
some receptions for them, where the honorableness of their
work and the necessity of doing it well might be discussed. I
earnestly hoped that no one should be ashamed of the word
servant, but should learn what great opportunity for doing
good there is for those who serve others.</p>
          <p>There is, and always must be, a large number of people
who must depend upon this class of employment for a living,
and there is every reason, therefore,
<pb id="coppin27" n="27"/>
why they should be especially prepared for it. A woman
should not only know how to cook in an ordinary way, but she
should have some idea of the chemical properties of the food
she cooks. The health of those whom she serves depends
much upon the nutritive qualities of the food which she
prepares. It is possible to burn all the best out of a beefsteak,
and leave a pork chop with those elements which should have
been neutralized by thorough cooking.</p>
          <p>A housemaid should know enough about sanitation to
appreciate the difference between well ventilated sleeping
rooms and those where impure air prevails.</p>
          <p>I have often thought, as I sat in churches, that janitors
should be better prepared for their work by being taught the
difference between pure air and air with a strong infusion of
coal gas.</p>
          <p>Then, besides the mere knowledge of how to do things,
morality and Christian courtesy are valuable assets for those
who serve others. Thoughtful kindness for those we serve is
always in place.</p>
          <p>As a means of preparation for this work, which I may call
an Industrial Crusade, I studied Political Economy for two
years under Dr. William Elder, who was a disciple of Mr. Henry
C. Carey, the eminent writer on the doctrine of Protective
Tariff.</p>
          <p>In the year 1879 the Board of Education of Philadelphia,
instructed and admonished by the exhibit of work done in the
schools of Europe, as exhibited in the Centennial exhibition of
'76, began to consider what
<pb id="coppin28" n="28"/>
they were doing to train their young people in the industrial
arts and trades. The comparison was not very gratifying. The
old apprenticeship system had silently glided away, and
merchants declared that under the pressure of competition they
were not able to compete with other merchants, nor were they
able to stand the waste made by those who did not know how
to handle the new material economically. At a meeting of some
of the public school directors and heads of some of the
educational institutions, I was asked to tell what was being
done in Philadelphia for the industrial education of the colored
youth. It may well be understood I had a tale to tell. And I told
them the only places in the city where a colored boy could learn
a trade was in the House of Refuge or the Penitentiary, and the
sooner he became incorrigible and got into the Refuge, or
committed a crime and got into the Penitentiary, the more
promising it would be for his industrial training. It was to me a
serious occasion. I so expressed myself. As I saw building after
building going up in this city, and not a single colored hand
employed in the constructions, it made the occasion a very
serious one to me. Nor could I be comforted by what the
Irishman said, that all he had to do was to put some bricks into
a hod and carry them up on the building, and there sat a
gentleman who did all the work. The arguments which I then
gave were chiefly those which I afterwards repeated in my
appeal to the citizens of Philadelphia, and which I elsewhere
reproduce.</p>
          <pb id="coppin29" n="29"/>
          <p>The next day Mrs. Elizabeth Whitney, the wife of one of
the school directors, drove up to my school and said: Mrs.
Coppin, I was there last night and heard what you had to say
about the limitations of the colored youth, and I am here to
say, if the colored people will go ahead and start a school for
the purpose of having the colored youth taught this greatly
needed education, you will find plenty of friends to help you.
Here are fifty dollars to get you started, and you will find as
much behind it as you need.</p>
          <p>We only needed a feather's weight of encouragement to
take up the burden. We started out at once. A temporary
organization was formed, with Anna Hallowell as treasurer and
Mr. Theodore Starr as president. I was unwilling to be the
custodian of any large amount of money which might be
begged from the poor colored people, and so myself and those
who helped me asked each one to give only one dollar. I
cannot mention the incidents which arose during this struggle
and endeavor to supply this greatly needed want. We carried
on an industrial crusade which never ended until we saw a
building devoted to the purpose of teaching trades. For the
managers of the Institute, seeing the need of the work, threw
themselves into this new business, after their thirty previous
years working for the colored youth. Our money in the end
amounted to nearly three thousand dollars, and of this we
have always been justly very glad. We could have had twenty
times as much more, except for my backwardness and
unwillingness to press poor
<pb id="coppin30" n="30"/>
people beyond what I thought they could give. Three
thousand dollars was a mere drop in the bucket, but it was a
great deal to us, who had seen it collected in small sums—quarters, dollars, etc. It was a delightful scene to us to pass
thru that school where ten trades were being taught, altho in
primitive fashion, the limited means of the Institute precluding
the use of machinery. The managers always refused to take
any money from the State, altho it was frequently offered.</p>
          <p>Many were the ejaculations of satisfaction at this busy
hive of industry.  “Ah,” said some,  “this is the way the school
should have begun, the good Quaker people began at the
wrong end.” Not so, for when they began this school, the
whole South was a great industrial plant where the fathers
taught the sons and the mothers taught the daughters, but the
mind was left in darkness. That is the reason that John C.
Calhoun is said to have remarked:  “If you will show me a Negro
who can conjugate a Greek verb, I will give up all my
preconceived ideas of him.” So that the managers had builded
wiser than many persons knew.</p>
          <p>In the fall of the same year, namely, in November,
'79, as a means of bringing the idea of industrial education 
and self help practically before the colored
people of the United States, I undertook the work of
helping an enterprise, namely, <hi rend="italics">The Christian Recorder,</hi>
edited and published by colored men at 631 Pine street,
Philadelphia. I here reproduce the plea made thirty-four 
years ago:</p>
          <p>The Publication Department of <hi rend="italics">The Christian Recorder</hi> 
<pb id="coppin31" n="31"/>
is weighed down by a comparatively small debt,
which cripples its usefulness and thus threatens its existence.
This paper finds its way into many a dark hamlet in the South,
where no one ever heard of the Philadelphia <hi rend="italics">Bulletin</hi> or the
<hi rend="italics">New York Tribune.</hi> A persistent vitality has kept this paper
alive thru a good deal of thick and thin since 1852. In helping to
pay this debt we shall also help to keep open an honorable
vocation to colored men who, if they will be printers, must
  “shinny on their own side.” Knowing the conditions of the
masses of our people, no large sums were asked for; the people
were requested to club together and send on a number of little
gifts, which might be at a stated time exhibited and sold at a
fair. And thus the debt liquidated by a co-operative effort
would be an instructive lesson of how light a burden becomes
when borne by the many instead of the few.  “Send something
which you yourself have made or produced,” we said.  “Let
what you send be made valuable by your artistic skill, your
invention, and your industry.” It was hinted that an exhibition
of this sort might be greatly useful and creditable to us as a
people, and that anything, from a potato to a picture, would be
accepted. The result has been such as to gratify the highest
expectations. Responses by donations of articles or money
have been received from the following States: Michigan,
Wisconsin, Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Arkansas, Kansas, Texas,
Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, North Carolina, South
Carolina, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, New Jersey, New
<pb id="coppin32" n="32"/>
York, Rhode Island, Florida, Massachusetts, Virginia,
Pennsylvania, Indian Territory and the District of Columbia.
About two-thirds of the things at this fair were sent from the
South, from Texas and some other distant parts, where the
expressage on a box would have been large—our sugar cane
cost our Florida friends $7 to express—from these points the
people sent money; more than $80.00 thus contributed was
spent to buy things on commission to help out. It seemed due
to the people of the South and West who have so generously
sent their little gifts to help keep alive a printing establishment
in this city, from which there is no hope of their receiving any
pecuniary benefit, it seemed due to them, I repeat, that we
should not diminish the profits arising from the sale of these
things by the purchase of gaudy and artistic flummery to dress
the hall; so those who come to visit us will not , we hope,
expect too much. The poor people who have sent us these
things have shown a spirit of self-denial and of generous zeal
which borders on heroism. All classes, including old people
and young children, have vied with each other in sending
some little article for the fair. If we had dared last year to
predict these wonderful results it would have been set down as
transcendental bosh, but we would have spoken  “but the
words of truth and soberness.” The different kinds of
needlework, crochet work and worsted work are very
creditable; as also is the model of a church in Providence,
Rhode Island, sent by a little boy; two ships, full rigged, and
especially the decorated plates,
<pb id="coppin33" n="33"/>
and the pictures,  “A Rocky Coast,” the 
“Coast of Maine,” and
the  “Wreck at Cape May” last summer, by H. O. Tanner, son of
the editor of <hi rend="italics">The Christian Recorder. </hi>The last contributors are
colored lads, and I venture nothing in saying that their work
would be creditable to any exhibition. The well-known artists,
Robert Douglass and Wm. H. Dorsey, have many fine
paintings on exhibition, especially an oil painting of Mr. Fred
Douglass. The agricultural products could have been far larger
than they are but for two reasons; first, it was especially
understood in the beginning that this exhibition was to show,
not what the few can do when they do a great deal, but what
the many can do when each does a little; secondly, we were
not able to pay the cost of expressage. I mean no reflection in
any quarter when I ask thoughtful people if an exhibition of
this kind, and for this cause, is not almost as important as
holding a convention and reading a lot of  “papers.” The great
lesson to be taught by this fair is the value of co-operative
effort to make our cents dollars, and to show us what help
there is for ourselves in ourselves. That the colored people of
this country have enough money to materially alter their
financial condition, was clearly demonstrated by the millions of
dollars deposited in the Freedmen's Bank, that they have the
good sense, and the unanimity to use this power is now
proven by this industrial exhibition and fair. It strikes me that
much of the talk about the exodus has proceeded upon the
high-handed assumption that, owing largely to the credit
system 
<pb id="coppin34" n="34"/>
of the South, the colored people there are forced to the
alternative to  “curse God, and die,” or else
  “go West.” Not a
bit of it. The people of the South, it is true, cannot produce
hundreds of dollars, but they have millions of pennies; and
millions of pennies make tens of thousands of dollars. By
clubbing together and lumping their pennies, a fund might be
raised in the cities of the South that the poorer classes might
fall back upon while their crops are growing, or else by the
opening of co-operative stores become their own creditors and
so effectually rid themselves of their merciless extortioners.  “O,
they won't do anything; you can't get them united on
anything!” The best way for a man to prove that he can do a
thing is to do it, and that is what we have done. This fair,
participated in by twenty-four States in the Union, and got up
for a purpose which is of no pecuniary benefit to those
concerned in it, effectually silences all slanders about  “we
won't or we can't do,” and teaches its own instructive and
greatly needed lessons of self-help, the best help that any man
can have, next to God's.</p>
          <p>Those who have this matter in charge have studiously
avoided preceding it with noisy and demonstrative babblings,
which are so often the vapid precursors of promises as empty
as themselves; therefore in some quarters our fair has been
overlooked. It is not, we think, a presumptuous interpretation
of this great movement, to say that the voice of God now
seems to utter,  “Speak to the people that they go forward.”  
 “Go forward” in what respect? Teach the millions of poor
<pb id="coppin35" n="35"/>
colored laborers of the South how much power they have in
themselves, by co-operation of effort, and by a combination of
their small means to change the despairing poverty which now
drives them from their homes, and makes them a millstone
around the neck of any community, South or West. Secondly,
that we shall go forward in asking to enter the same
employments which other people enter. Within the past ten
years we have made almost no advance in getting our youth
into industrial and business occupations. It is just as hard to
get a boy into a printing office now as it was ten years ago. It
is simply astonishing when we consider how many of the
common vocations of life colored people are shut out of.
Colored men are not admitted to the Printers' Trade Union, nor,
with very rare exceptions, are they employed in any city of the
United States in a paid capacity as printers or writers, one of
the rare exceptions being the employment of H. Price Williams,
on the Sunday<hi rend="italics"> Press</hi> of this city. We are not employed as
salesmen, or pharmacists, or saleswomen, or bank clerks, or
merchants' clerks, or tradesmen, or mechanics, or telegraph
operators, or to any degree as State or Government officials,
and I could keep on with the string of  “ors” until tomorrow
morning, but the patience of a reader has its limit.</p>
          <p>Slavery made us poor, and its gloomy, malicious shadow
tends to keep us so. I beg to say, kind reader, that this is not
spoken in a spirit of recrimination; we have no quarrel with our
fate, and we leave your
<pb id="coppin36" n="36"/>
Christianity to yourself. Our faith is firmly fixed in that  “Eternal
Providence,” that in its own good time will  “justify the ways of
God to man.” But, believing that to get the right men into the
right places is a  “consummation most devoutly to be wished,” 
it is a matter of serious concern to us to see our youth, with
just as decided diversity of talent as any other people, all
herded together into three or four occupations. It is cruel to
make a teacher or a preacher of a man who ought to be a printer
or a blacksmith, and that is exactly what we are now obliged to
do. The most advance that has been made since the war has
been done by political parties, and it is precisely into political
positions that we think it least desirable that our youth should
enter. We have our choice of the professions, but, as we have
not been endowed with a monopoly of brains, it is not
probable that we can contribute to the bar a great lawyer,
except once in a great while. The same may be said of
medicine; nor are we able to tide over the  “starving time,” 
between the reception of a diploma and the time that a man's
profession becomes a paying one.</p>
          <p>Being determined to know whether this industrial and
business ostracism was  “in ourselves or in our stars,” we have
from time to time, knocked, shaken and kicked at these closed
doors of work. A cold, metallic voice from within replies,  “We
do not employ colored people.” Ours not to make reply, ours
not to question why. Thank heaven, we are not
<pb id="coppin37" n="37"/>
obliged to do and die, having the preference to do or die, we
naturally prefer to do. But we can not help wondering if some
ignorant or faithless steward of God's work and God's money
hasn't blundered. It seems necessary that we should make
known to the good men and women who are so solicitous
about our souls and our minds that we haven't quite got rid of
our bodies yet, and until we do we must feed and clothe them;
and this thing of keeping us out of work forces us back upon
charity. That distinguished thinker, Mr. Henry C. Carey, in his
valuable works on Political Economy, has shown by the
truthful and irresistible logic of history that the elevation of all
peoples to a higher moral and intellectual plane, and to a fuller
investiture of their civil rights has always steadily kept pace
with the improvements in their physical condition. Therefore
we feel that resolutely and in unmistakable language, yet in the
dignity of moderation, we should strive to make known to all
men the justice of our claims to the same employments as other
men under the same conditions. We do not ask that any one of
our people shall be put into a position because he is a colored
person, but we do most emphatically ask that he shall not be
kept out of a position because he is a colored person.  “An
open field and no favors” is all that is requested. The time was
when to put a colored boy or girl behind a counter would have
been to decrease custom; it would have been a tax upon the
employer, and a charity that we were too proud to
<pb id="coppin38" n="38"/>
accept; but public sentiment has changed. I am satisfied that
the employment of a colored clerk or a colored saleswoman
wouldn't even be a “nine days'  wonder.” It is easy of
accomplishment, and yet it is not done. To thoughtless and
headstrong people who meet duty with impertinent dictation I
do not now address myself; but to those who wish the most
gracious of all blessings, a fuller enlightenment as to their
duty, to those I beg to say, think of what is said in this appeal.</p>
          <p>We do not ask our white friends to come out and make
this fair a success. If the word  “grand”  was not so abominably
ill used, I would say that we have already made it a grand
success; come and help us make it a greater one. For ten days
the colored citizens have crowded this fair. They have bought
more than half our contributions. From the ministers of
the churches, irrespective of denomination, to the ladies who
are attending tables, and the United Order of Masons who
rented us the hall, all have shown a generosity, devotion and a
warmth of public spirit worthy of the highest praise.</p>
          <p>Believing that all efforts at self-help are worthy of
respect, and when a man is using every effort in his power to
help himself he may with propriety call upon his friends for
encouragement, I now respectfully submit this matter to the
citizens of Philadelphia and cordially invite them to visit us. As
those of us who have charge of the fair are working-women,
we do not open it until five o'clock in the afternoon. It is held
in Masonic Hall, on Eleventh street, between Pine and
Lombard, and will continue all this week.</p>

          <head>II.</head>
          <head>ELEMENTARY EDUCATION.</head>
          <p>MY DEEP interest centers in elementary education for several
reasons; first, because it is at this period of the child's life
that habits are formed and tastes cultivated which may
guide him in the pursuit of knowledge and happiness in
after life, and which by the alchemy of experience are to
change the elements of what he has learned into wisdom for
his highest happiness. All higher learning is but a
combination of a few simple elements, and when these are
well taught, it clears away the difficulty of future
acquisitions, and nature can spread her beauty before eyes
that can see and teach the marvelous precision of her laws,
to ears that can hear. I call this opening the doors upward
and outward, whereas a different way of instruction is like 
going out of a room backward.</p>
          <p>Again, we want to lift education out of the slough of the
passive voice. Little Mary goes to school to be educated, and
her brother John goes to the high school for the same purpose.
It is too often the case that the passive voice has the right of
way, whereas in the very beginning we should call into active
service all the
<pb id="coppin40" n="40"/>
faculties of mind and body. Unfortunately book learning is so
respectable, and there is so much of it all about us, that it is apt
to crowd out the prosy process of thinking, comparing,
reasoning, to which our wisest efforts should be directed.</p>
          <p>Now, when we consider how much is lost by those who
lose the benefit of the elementary development, and are
therefore unable to pursue the higher branches with any degree
of success or comfort to themselves or others, it is evident that
this subject is worthy of a wise investigation and we must ask
ourselves, how far are we responsible for this condition of
affairs? I fear that the reason that so many are unable to keep
up when they begin the higher studies is because they never
mastered the elementary principles.</p>
          <p>If a pupil is absent review day, or demonstration day, he is
sure to feel the loss keenly in further pursuit of his studies.
Growth in learning and acquisition proceeds slowly and by
steps, and we must follow nature's direction.</p>
          <p>To be at our business punctually and promptly every day
is positively necessary for success, and no trifling excuse
ought to be sufficient to keep us from our duty. You know
what Uncle Dread said: “Scuses, scuses, the world is built on
scuses.” A habit of always being on hand in time will save the
child from much loss in its after life.</p>
          <p>I think a very profitable way to help those who have been
absent to make up for what they have lost, while at the same
time they are getting the work better
<pb id="coppin41" n="41"/>
understood, is to have daily reviews of at least one half of
the lesson; part oral and a part written. Such a course will be
beneficial even to those who were not absent. It will be found
very profitable always to have two or three divisions of the
class. The divisions can be based upon ability to do the work
rapidly or slowly. For where a person who is very quick gets
beside a person who is very slow, he feels that he is wasting
his time and becomes very impatient. And now is the
time for the exercise of that Christian courtesy which will help
us all the way through life.</p>
          <p>Never let the word “dumb” be used in your class, or
anything said disrespectful of parents or guardians who may
have helped the child. If the teacher has
the questions or the review well selected, they can be quickly
given out and no one division has to wait for the other. When
the teacher has given all the time
possible to certain work, the divisions can be stopped,
arranged in order and the pupils will profit by the criticisms of
one another, the teacher making no corrections that can
possibly be made by the class; thus inviting 
and stimulating the critical knowledge or judgment of
all; whether in punctuation, spelling, subject
matter, or the appearance of the work; the advanced lesson
already having been heard by the teacher.</p>
          <p>Blackboards are of great use in schools, and are a mercy
to the eyes of the pupils that are thus released from the printed
page; or if we can't have blackboards, then we can use brown
paper, saved up from bundles containing articles, etc.</p>
          <pb id="coppin42" n="42"/>
          <p>I do not see how a teacher can succeed well without
ingenuity, because ways of finding means to an end must
often be discovered by the teacher. It has been said that not
only from the elementary classes, but also from the higher
classes, those that drop out do so from the want of better
elementary training.</p>
          <p>I should like to ask why some of the axioms that might be
so helpful are not brought to bear much earlier in the course of
instruction. For instance the square of the sum, the square of
the difference, and the rectangle of the sum and difference, as
(5+3)X(5+3), (5-3)X(5-3) and(5+3)X(5-3)</p>
          <p>To do this work and then show by inspection that the
first contains</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>1. Square of the sum.</item>
            <item>2. Square of the difference.</item>
            <item>3. Rectangle of the sum and difference.</item>
          </list>
          <p>The multiplication table offers a fruitful field for study,
developing the tables of 2's, 3's and 4's etc., and picking out
cubes and squares in each one.</p>
          <p>I've often had teachers say to me, Oh, that was learned
long ago.</p>
          <p>The numerical cube is the product of a number taken
twice as a factor or multiplied into itself once:</p>
          <p>The geometrical square is an equilateral rectangle:</p>
          <p>The numerical cube is the product of a number taken
three times as a factor or multiplied into itself twice.</p>
          <pb id="coppin43" n="43"/>
          <p>The geometrical cube is a solid bounded by six equal
squares.</p>
          <p>One of the most useful operations is, having a fractional
part of a number, to find it; as, 30 is 5/7 of what number? We
shall meet this operation often, even in higher arithmetic, and it
can be easily taught when teaching the multiplication table.</p>
          <p>Of course, when pupils are just beginning they cannot be
left so much to themselves, for everything must be carefully
done.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="Part I">
          <pb id="coppin44" n="44"/>
          <head>III.</head>
          <head>METHODS OF INSTRUCTION.</head>
          <p>I AM always sorry to hear that such
and such a person is going to school
to be educated.</p>
          <p>This is a great mistake. If the
person is to get the benefit of what
we call education, he must educate
himself, under the direction of the teacher.</p>
          <p>To go into the school and take one's seat is not a
favorable sign for the work that is going to be done; the very
first thing to do is to get our pupils into an orderly arrangement
for working. The teacher probably has two or three divisions;
one set will be employed at the blackboard, and one will recite
to the teacher the lesson of the day. The work at the
blackboard is review work. And just here is a very important
step.</p>
          <p>What shall the review consist of? I would say let one-half
or three-fourths of the lesson be the review, and spend the rest
of the time on the advanced lesson; that is, the lesson for the
day. In order that no time may be lost in giving out the review,
the teacher will have all the points selected for review written
off, and some member of the class may pass
<pb id="coppin45" n="45"/>
these papers round to the division that has the review, and
each one as he takes his paper goes to the board to do his
work; or, if he has no board, then he must have the paper to
write on, but let us hope that a very few will have to use paper,
for the eye needs rest from the small writing with the pencil,
and the eye of the teacher is also benefited by not having to
scrutinize small letters, whereas the chalk on the blackboard
sets off the words and is a great relief to the eye.</p>
          <p>When the teacher has given as much time as he can with
the work on the board, he stops the class that has been
reciting to him and both divisions undertake the corrections of
the board work; this must be done in a systematic manner.</p>
          <p>Where shall we begin?</p>
          <p>I should say to begin with what appears to be the poorest
work on the board, in order that the most corrections may be
made, and now the teacher must show great skill in keeping
the attention of the class fixed upon one matter, for when they
are enthusiastic, all will want to speak at once, or some will
want to make remarks, or to jump from one point to another
before the first is completely done.</p>
          <p>Those who have been absent from time to time will find
the reviews a great benefit to them, for when there is a distinct
failure, we often hear the person say, I was absent when that
lesson was given, for I don't remember it at all. How, then,
could these children
<pb id="coppin46" n="46"/>
go on with the advanced lesson with any degree of
understanding or profit?</p>
          <p>Trial examinations upon simple principles that have been
given for some time will oftentimes be of great profit to the
class.</p>
          <p>The teacher is not supposed to be talking or looking out
of the window while the examination goes on, but is passing
quietly from seat to seat looking at each person's work, so that
when the time is up he is quite well informed as to how each
person has succeeded in the work required of him, and what
the principal errors are.</p>
          <p>The vital errors are errors in the principles used. The
misspelled words, grammatical errors, and anything else wrong
comes in for its share of correction.</p>
          <p>This correction by the teacher, coming immediately after
the work is done, is very helpful to those being examined, and
saves the teacher from carrying the work home and having to
go over it all by himself, and besides, the pupils get far more
benefit from this co-operative correction, as it may be called.</p>
          <p>In order that the teacher may do his best work while his
class is with him, it is necessary that he should have his work
all arranged in his own mind before he meets the class. If the
teacher is ingenious and he cannot be a good teacher without
ingenuity, he can think out many helpful ways to occupy his
pupils to the best advantage while he is with them. The lowest
classes, as well as the highest, will reap
<pb id="coppin47" n="47"/>
great benefit from this skillful arrangement of their work by
their teacher. I have before spoken of division of classes into
two or three sections, but the teacher who makes the division
must be very careful not to say of number one, this is the
slowest division; or of another, this one can go more rapidly.</p>
          <p>The teacher knows upon what principle to form his
division, but if he begins to state his reasons to the class he
will find it like throwing down the apple of discord: there will
be no end to the exclamations of those who are in number two,
who say that they could go on with number three, and those in
number one will declare they can work just as fast as number
two.</p>
          <p>It is enough for the teacher to say that the classes can be
managed and can do far more work when the teacher handles
them in smaller numbers, so that one division can be writing
while another is reciting, and all are kept busy as bees. The
whole class should be working under the eye of the teacher. It
ought not be necessary for the teacher to turn around to see if
those who are at the board or those who are doing the work in
their seats are in good order and not disturbing one another. A
skillful arrangement on the part of the teacher can bring the
whole under his own supervision. But the teacher should by
no means take up a position as if watching the pupils. Put their
conduct on high ground at the very beginning, and when they
disappoint you by doing what the teacher would object to, we
must let them know how disappointed
<pb id="coppin48" n="48"/>
we are by such a betrayal of trust, and they may start the next
day to do better; and so, little by little, these young people will
acquire the habit of doing what they know is right, whether
the teacher sees them or not.</p>
          <p>I have before spoken of talking in classes, because it
disturbs the teacher and disturbs the class, but I have often
heard them say, suppose I only whisper, would that disturb
the class? As far as my experience goes, there can be no
compromise with talking or whispering while the work is going
on. The habit of self control is not easily acquired, but when
the pupil has his tongue under control St. James says,  “He is
able also to bridle the whole body.”  I believe that many a
dreadful result has followed a too free use of the tongue, for it
is well said, one word always brings on another and before we
know it we are in the midst of a hot dispute over something.
Not only the children, but the teacher may have too nimble a
tongue, and may use it, not to explain what is difficult to the
pupils, but to discuss why they are so stupid as to need any
explanation.</p>
          <p>Sometimes the teachers make uncomplimentary remarks
about those who need to have the matter explained, saying,
anybody could see that. I heard of a little boy once whose
father had worked out some examples for him in arithmetic. The
teacher should have known that the child did not do the work,
and should have been careful about speaking of that work.
<pb id="coppin49" n="49"/>
 “Why, that's a very old-fashioned way of doing that work; we
don't do that way now,” and other things were said even more
uncomplimentary of the person who did the work for the child.
Here, again, is a case where the teacher needs to be corrected.
It may as well be understood that all remarks which are
disrespectful to the parents or guardian ought never to be
indulged in by the teacher. Calling names, the words stupid, or
dunce, or dumb, serves only to make the pupil angry or to
discourage him. Here, again, the teacher ought to think of
himself when he was taking his first lessons. Whenever a pupil
has spoken disrespectfully to a teacher and the teacher can
say with truth, do I not always speak kindly and politely to
you? the case is won without any more argument. I have never
known this to fail. I have often seen a tear steal down the face
of a child, and then I neither asked for an apology nor forced
one, but of the child's own volition it came at once.</p>
          <p>How can we get the child trained to do what he dislikes to
do and to obey our laws without corporal punishment? If the
parent begins early enough, there is every hope of success,
but, unfortunately, it is thought the child isn't old enough to
understand what we wish him to do. For instance, a mother
sees her little boy going around the room with a hammer, and
of course looking for something to hit with it. She repeatedly
tells him to bring the hammer to mamma, but he pays no
attention to it. And, waiting a little while, she goes to him and
takes the hammer away
<pb id="coppin50" n="50"/>
from him. He struggles with all his little might to keep it.</p>
          <p>The mother should know it will not be very long before
that little fellow will be strong enough, not only to keep the
hammer, but to do with it as he will. Then was the time, when
he paid no attention, for her to have taught that child to obey
her and bring her the hammer of his own will. A little battle like
that lost or won means victory or defeat for that child's future
character.</p>
          <p>To learn to give up his own will to that of his parents or
teacher, as we must to the Great Teacher of all, will surely make
us happy in this life and in the life to come. Happy is the child
who has wise parents and guardians, and whose training is
continued when he enters the school room. Whereas when a
child has had little training in obedience at home it is not long
before he gets into trouble in the school room, for there he
finds himself surrounded by laws which he must obey if he
makes the progress in his studies and in his character which
he ought to make, which will give him an honored place in the
school and out of it.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="Part I">
          <pb id="coppin51" n="51"/>
          <head>IV.</head>
          <head>DIAGNOSIS AND DISCIPLINE.</head>
          <p>IT IS possible for the teacher to
notice who those are in the class
who do not care for learning what
we have to give them; and the
question to ask ourselves is, Why?
Are the lessons too hard? or are
they too long? Is the child well? Above all, does he
seem to pass from one to another part of study with
ease and comfort to himself, or is he troubled and uncertain? 
Does he often give excuses for staying
away, and does he fail to get the meaning of what we
are trying to teach him? When he fails in his lessons, 
does the teacher let the parent or guardian
know, and how is this information supposed to be received 
at his home?</p>
          <p>I have heard of a case where whenever the child failed in
his lessons, word was sent to his father, who gave him no
dinner and locked him up in the cellar. Would this punishment
incline the child to love his studies or to get them any better?
On the contrary, would he not hate them and be glad when he
is through with them? We should remember that punishments
<pb id="coppin52" n="52"/>
that do not correct, harden. For this reason we
should try to find out what the real trouble is, and then what
will best make up for it.</p>
          <p>Examinations privately conducted without letting the
person know what you are looking for may give the true source
of the trouble. And we may discover why the work we have
given is not done. For instance, at one time being accused of
having promoted a scholar to a higher class who could not
multiply, I replied, “I know he can multiply.”   “Try him
yourself,” said the teacher. And I did try him myself, and found
that when the multiplier and the multiplicand were separated as
in long division the child did not know at what end to begin to
multiply. As soon as I let in light on this point he went ahead
like everything. Sometimes I've said to myself as I've watched
the way that a pupil worked, you say you cannot get this
example; no, and you never would have gotten it if you had
kept on that way. All learning proceeds by steps. And the
absences of pupils may be illustrated by a ladder with a rung
out here and there. So that instead of the person going up
easily and smoothly, he is every now and then distracted by
the difficulty of the step. Let the pupils make a ladder, and
show these parts out. Every succeeding lesson is carefully
planned by a preceding demonstration or piece of instruction,
and when a pupil is absent on one of these days it is very
difficult to make up for it. We ought to be very careful about
apportioning
<pb id="coppin53" n="53"/>
any severe punishment, and it would be well to sleep over it
before we decide.</p>
          <p>If the teacher is just as angry as the pupil, which is
sometimes the case, he is not apt to do the wisest and kindest
thing to bring about a spirit of repentance and a wish to
correct what has been wrong. Happy is the teacher who can
wait to win his pupil, to what he believes to be right.</p>
          <p>I can think of no agency in the formation of a beautiful
character that is more powerful than the daily correction and
training which we call discipline, and here the teacher is all
powerful.</p>
          <p>The child can read his books and get much information
from them to help him in his education, but he cannot see
when he should be corrected, nor how to do so. To be apt in
diagnosing a case to find the difficulties that a child labors
under, and as apt in the correcting discipline, are valuable
qualifications for a teacher. These qualifications cannot be put
down in a book to be learned as ordinary lessons. We can only
give suggestions, and the teacher must work out his own
plans, and acquire the knowledge by actual practice.</p>
          <p>Many a child called dull, would advance rapidly under a
patient, wise and skillful teacher, and the teacher should be as
conscientious in the endeavor to improve himself as he is to
improve the child.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="Part I">
          <pb id="coppin54" n="54"/>
          <head>V.</head>
          <head>OBJECT OF PUNISHMENT.</head>
          <p>LET us understand that the object of
punishment is not to make up for
wrongdoing, for that cannot be
done; but, to prevent the repetition
of the wrong. It should always be
administered in a kind spirit, and
should be so reasonable, that a child's sense of justice
would agree with it. He should see that if he repeated
the wrong act it would not be good for him
nor for the teacher nor his parents nor the school.</p>
          <p>Of course no cruel punishment should ever be allowed,
and if whipping is to be done it is far better for the parent to
do it, for his hand is restrained by love.</p>
          <p>I once heard this story. Two little boys were out
selling matches; one having sold out met a comrade
who had not sold any. Said the one who had been
successful to his comrade, “I will take your matches
and give you my money. If I am not sold out when I
get home I shall get a whipping like yourself. Your
master would whip you, but my father would whip
me, but he wouldn't whip so hard nor so long as
<pb id="coppin55" n="55"/>
your master.” A page of philosophy could not give us a better
understanding of the case, than is given by the incident of
these two little match boys.</p>
          <p>Habits of obedience can be taught to a child when it is
little so that little by little he learns to give up his own will to
that of his parents or teacher, which alone can make us happy
in this life and the life to come. When spoken to
disrespectfully I would say to the child, “Do I not always
speak to you kindly and politely?” I never had to make any
other argument. I never asked for any apology, and I never
failed to get it. Not perhaps at that time, but after it had been
thought of. It seems to me that it would be very unwise to
send a bad report to the parent concerning the child unless we
know the disposition of the parent and his means of
correcting. This is very important, for if the child is not
corrected of his fault, he is apt to become worse instead of
better.</p>
          <p>Never be in a hurry about punishing a child. Think well
over it first. Always investigate a case thoroughly before you
punish a child.</p>
          <p>Try never to whip the child yourself; always report the
child to the parents when such correction is necessary.</p>
          <p>Never deprive a child of all of his recess. He is not a block
of wood; he needs fresh air and water and he will not be in a
condition to recite unless he has time for that. Some teachers
think they haven't
<pb id="coppin56" n="56"/>
punished enough unless they have taken all of his recess.
This is a great mistake. To take a child's lunch from him is a
great mistake. There is no use in attempting to teach a hungry
child.</p>
          <p>The ventilation of the school room may be responsible
for what we call stupidity on the part of the child.</p>
          <p>Let a stream of oxygen pass through the room and what a
waking-up there will be! Sometimes if a child is naughty it will
do him good to run out in the yard a minute.</p>
          <p>Remember all the time you are dealing with a human
being, whose needs are like your own.</p>
          <p>A child knows well when a teacher is kind and
considerate of him.</p>
          <p>Never take away a child's occupation as a punishment.</p>
          <p>The secret of good government is occupation of the right
kind.</p>
          <p>Keep your pupils pleasant by occupying them with your
work and they will not be apt so to give 
you trouble. There are a number of devices called 
 “Busy Work for the School Room.” These little occupations are
suited to every grade, and the teacher should make a study of
them and have them at his command. The teacher knows who
the restive pupils are, and work for these should be prepared
beforehand. A great deal of what we call mischief is animal
activity on the part of the child, and we must
<pb id="coppin57" n="57"/>
use that activity to make the child do our work and not his.</p>
          <p>There is too much repression and suppression in
schools.</p>
          <p>Let the child do something of himself and see what he will
do. The teacher must prepare for his work before he goes into
the school by getting together as much simple apparatus as
possible, and finding means of illustration.</p>
          <p>There are certain kinds of punishments that should never be
resorted to, such as shutting a child up in the school house while
you go to your dinner, or shutting him up in a dark closet and
keeping him there longer than a half hour, or boxing his ears or
hitting him over the head or calling him names.</p>
          <p>Try kindness; try to find the wiser way for correcting the
wrong.</p>
          <p>Be careful of arousing a spirit of revenge in your pupils.</p>

          <head>MORAL INSTRUCTION.</head>
          <p>WHATEVER we do, the first thing is
to have the child know about his
Heavenly Father, and that we must
all do what will please Him; and
no one of us must think of doing
the things that He hates. We cannot 
grow straight and beautiful if we disobey His
laws: and so, we must preoccupy the ground very
early, for evil is so crafty that even with all our vigilance 
it will get its work in somewhere. “Didst not
thou sow good seed in thy field? whence then hath
it tares?”</p>
          <p>However brilliant a person may be intellectually,
however skillful in the arts and sciences, he must be
reliable; he must be trustworthy.</p>
          <p>We must know that we can depend upon his word.
Obedience, truthfulness, love of right, and sincerity, must
be instilled and inculcated by precept and by example,
but always in kindness.</p>
          <p>Love wins when everything else will fail. You say
that your child resists all your efforts to break him of his
bad habits and make him become good. Have you tried
kindness? Have you tried love?</p>
          <pb id="coppin59" n="59"/>
          <p>The Commandments in verse are very easily
learned; therefore I would have them taught.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Thou should have no other Gods before me.</l>
            <l>Before no idol bend thy knee.</l>
            <l>Take not the name of God in vain.</l>
            <l>Nor dare the Sabbath Day profane.</l>
            <l>Give both thy parents honor due.</l>
            <l>Take heed that thou no murder do.</l>
            <l>Abstain from words and deeds unclean.</l>
            <l>Nor steal though thou art poor and mean.</l>
            <l>Nor make a willful lie and love it.</l>
            <l>What is thy neighbors do not covet.</l>
            <l>With all thy heart love God above,</l>
            <l>And as thyself thy neighbor love.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The pieces so called which the child learns, will
have much to do with forming his mind, and so we pick
them out with a great deal of care.</p>
          <p>Love to father and mother, sister and brother; love
to home and country; love to animals.</p>
          <p>In short fill the mind with what we know will keep it
pure and beautiful. Above all things see that the child is
getting a love to take in and do what is taught him.
Scripture that the child can understand will of course be
our first ally, as, “Jesus loves me this I know, for the
Bible tells me so.”</p>
          <p>Bands of Hope must be kept in view, for in the
very beginning the child must be taught the danger of
strong drink. The selection of pieces to sing must be
observed with great care. However pretty a tune is, if it
doesn't carry beautiful words we should not choose it.</p>
          <pb id="coppin60" n="60"/>
          <p>The books which our children read should also be
carefully looked into. We should do well always in Christmas
times and other times to be sure that one of the presents is a
book. And the child should be encouraged to make his own
little library case by utilizing a starch or soap box. Ingenious
young people can soon make a very presentable library case.</p>
          <p>Studies in history, American, English, French, etc.,
natural history and poetry, which children love so much, can
also be among the books.</p>
          <p>Happy are the children whose parents know the
importance of teaching them to love and care for books while
they are young. Among the little societies in our school, there
was one for charitable purposes and entirely in the hands of
the children. Each one was invited, not forced, to give one cent
a week. This sum amounted to $75 or $100 a year.</p>
          <p>They took charge of small cases of want and destitution
until they could report them to the proper societies. And it was
a great comfort to me when the time came to make their
contributions to various charities, such as the Children's
Home; the Aged Home; Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals, and other charities; and to see them making out
their little checks was also comforting. There was much
merriment when we came to this little business, for how to
draw up a money order, or how to make out a check and other
little matters of bookkeeping had to be taught.</p>
          <p>As I have said; nobody was obliged to give the
<pb id="coppin61" n="61"/>
penny a week, but they all were invited to do so. When the
young people came home after vacation, they had made
sums to help themselves along, and those sums added
together varied from $2,000 to $2,500.</p>
          <p>Of course the students in the higher classes made most,
because they could get more responsible work to do. Very
interesting incidents cropped out during these reports, but I
can only mention one or two. One of our little girls between
eleven years and twelve went along as chore girl. But there
was consternation in the household when it was
discovered that the cook had disappointed. “But,” said the
little girl, “I can cook.” So it was only necessary to change
places. And our little girl found her wages increased from $1
to $3 a week.</p>
          <p>Another case of a little girl only about seven years who
had saved up a little something during the vacation. “Now
what did you do?” said I, “I know you couldn't have
worked.”   “I used to go every Sunday and take a blind lady
to church. Then she used to give me fifty cents every time I
went and I saved it up.”</p>
          <p>Many incidents might be told of this kind, but I am
warned that printing costs money, but the training which
bears fruit in a thoughtful application of
what we have learned deserves encouragement.</p>
          <p>There is, in my opinion, no incompatibility between
higher learning and work.</p>
          <p>The study room and the workshop ought to have their
hours so arranged that both can be advanced together. The
saw and the plane waiting with gracious
<pb id="coppin62" n="62"/>
patience upon the hammer and the anvil, and both
accompaniments.</p>
          <p>A skillful arrangement of the hours of study and of
demonstration will prove the workableness of what I am
saying, and ten years hence, when that same carpenter or
blacksmith may be wanted to give his opinion on some knotty
points in interdependent study which men's reasoning has
failed to smooth off, it may be found that our mechanic may
have need for the learning which was not thought necessary
when he was getting his trade.</p>
          <p>Trustworthiness and reliability should be the outgrowth
of the moral instruction which we give. Without this fine fruit
of all our teaching, all else will be of little account. I might have
said of no account.</p>

          <head>VII.</head>
          <head>GOOD MANNERS.</head>
          <p>THE teaching of good manners in the
home, is of the highest importance. 
The little child is taught to
say, if you please, and thank you,
not only to mother and father, but
to brothers and sisters; and I know
of nothing that conduces more to the happiness of the
home than the manner of speaking to each other by
all the members of the family. Some people seem
to think that good manners need only be exercised
toward our superiors or toward strangers, but this is
a great mistake. A gentleman can always be told by
the way he speaks to those that he thinks are his inferiors 
in some respect. His equals be does not wish
to offend, his superiors he does not dare to offend, and
of those whom he considers his inferiors he would be
all the more considerate.</p>
          <p>It is a very unsafe thing to graduate our politeness to
what we suppose to be the position of the person we are
addressing. I have heard of a car conductor who was very
impolite to an old gentleman on his train because he was
rather shabbily dressed; and he made many inquiries as to
how he came by his rate book, with other unnecessary
questions, which
<pb id="coppin64" n="64"/>
did not concern him. A short time after, when he was released
from his position, he was astonished to find that he had been
talking to the president of the road. Good manners will often
take people where neither money nor education will take them.</p>
          <p>If we could follow many serious evils in life to their
sources, we should find that many of them sprang from what
we should regard as very insignificant matters. The girl who
could not hold her tongue in school, but was always ready
with a smart reply, may trace her broken household some day
to that same fluency in speech. For it is indeed true that one
word brings on another and the word that is brought on is
generally not such as to help matters. We do well to remember
that a soft answer turneth away wrath, but grievous words stir
up anger. Words, words, how they can make or mar our lives!
The temper must be curbed, must be held in if necessary with
 “bit and bridle” until it yields to control.</p>

          <head>VIII.</head>
          <head>HOW TO TEACH READING AND SPELLING.</head>
          <p>THERE are now so many new ways of
teaching reading and spelling that
teachers can have their choice and take
whatever plan they find the most
effective.</p>
          <p>To learn to read, write and spell one
word the first day, will be found to be very interesting to the
children. The word “man” is a good word to begin with,
because day after day by the addition of one more letter each
day we can form a sentence. Words are more interesting than
letters, and sentences are more interesting than words. So that
as soon as possible the teacher wants to make a sentence. But
it is not supposed that we should omit to teach the alphabet in
order, for we know that this is necessary. But by no means
allow this to be done mentally. Have the book or the chart with
the letters large and distinctly made, and have the children's
eyes follow the work as the teacher points to each letter and
calls its name. There are many little devices that a teacher can
use to get the children interested in the work. Among them
may be picking out the printed letters that they have learned
when
<pb id="coppin66" n="66"/>
they see them in a book or paper, and sometimes the teacher
will have them in a little box and the children are asked to pick
out such and such a letter and bring it to the teacher. The
movements of the hand and arm in making letters should be
frequently practiced by the pupils, and this is a wonderful help
when they come to make the letters on the board or on the
paper.</p>
          <p>The pupils are thus led along skillfully until they are ready
to take the first lessons in their readers; then, how the work will
jump! No drawling tones will be heard then, for their
preparations will make them feel that they know the whole
book. The articles <hi rend="italics">a</hi> and <hi rend="italics">the</hi> having been pronounced naturally
as “a[a with breve]h,”  “the[e with caron],” the child will read, “The[e with caron] boy has a[a with breve] dog.” And
not, “The boy has a[a with macron] dog.<sic corr="&quot;"/> Sometimes it is very hard to break up
this unnatural way of reading. As the child's writing has kept
pace with its reading, one child can copy a letter on the board
while the teacher hears the others read. When the writing is
finished, the whole class turns to the board to correct whatever
has been written, and then they have a lively time. From lesson
to lesson this plan is pursued until the child gets through with
the Third Reader, and then what a mass of information the
child has acquired, and what facility in reading, writing and
spelling! But there can hardly be a better way to train a child to
think and to reason than by the constant comparisons which
he has had to make use of in learning the letters and all
about them. Besides,
<pb id="coppin67" n="67"/>
when a person can read, the whole realm of knowledge lies
open before him, and if necessary he can go on by himself; for
many a learned person had to begin in this way. I will next
speak of advanced reading. A clear-cut enunciation of the
vowels, the consonants and certain combinations of
consonants have been insisted upon during the elementary
stages of the child's progress. Nor has he been allowed to drop
his final <hi rend="italics">t's</hi> or <hi rend="italics">d's</hi> nor to say <hi>w</hi> for <hi rend="italics">v.</hi>  Fortunate is the child who
has had a careful and well-prepared teacher in his early lessons
in reading. Before the child begins to read he should know the
definitions of the words he is using, and this matter too has
had attention in the preceding reading lessons. It would be a
great pity to allow the child to consider a lesson learned,
simply because he could pronounce the words fluently, for the
meaning is all-important. It is very helpful if the definitions of
the words in the reading lessons are written at the top of the
page as they are in some books; and the preparation for the
day's lesson should be to have these words correctly
pronounced, and their definitions written upon the board, and
as words have more than one definition, it is good practice to
see what other meanings the class can give. When the class
begins to read, let the pupils read the lesson straight thru,
going from one to the other without interruption. If any one
has been looking off his book and is not ready, pass him by
and go right on to the next one. Do not stop to correct
mispronounced words, but wait until the lesson has been
<pb id="coppin68" n="68"/>
read thru once. In this way we shall get the sense of the lesson.
It is objected that if we leave the corrections until the reading is
finished, they will be forgotten; but stopping after each one
reads, to say what you noticed was wrong, etc., keeps the
pupils from getting a connected idea of the lesson, and hence,
destroys the interest in it. When the lesson is read thru again
the corrections are made. The spelling lesson should consist
largely of words taken from the reading lesson, for these will be
the most useful that the pupil can have, and when these words
are recited, it should be by writing them in sentences. It may be
objected that this takes too much time, as the time given to
spelling is generally less than that given to other subjects. But
are not reading and spelling the most important lessons that the
child can have? Five words correctly defined and written in
sentences are of more value than twenty words simply spelled
correctly. In the very beginning the marks of punctuation
should be used, and the marks of contraction and the
possessive case should be observed closely, as, John's father
was <hi rend="italics">too</hi> busy <hi rend="italics">to</hi> waste <hi rend="italics">two</hi> minutes from his business. The
architect <hi rend="italics">planned</hi> the building and the carpenter <hi rend="italics">planed</hi>
some of the joists the next day.</p>
          <p> “I do not complain of the boys' work,” said their father,
 “but I wished they had gone farther while they were about it.”</p>
          <p>Men's and women's clothing is made from different kinds
of cloth, It will be seen that the teacher
<pb id="coppin69" n="69"/>
takes advantage of simple grammatical rules to have the
writing correctly done. I will hereafter give a number of
sentences to illustrate what I mean. I should have said, that as
soon as possible, the child should be taught to write a letter.
The words mother, father, sister, brother and teacher should
be spelled and written for him so that the little letter beginning
Dear mother can begin to be made the subject of instruction.</p>
          <p>The child's interest is awakened and he will try his best to
learn other words that he will write to his mother. If this begins
in the first reader, before the third is finished the child will be
quite a little scribe. But we must proceed very slowly with this
work. One or two words at a time are all that can be taken, and
for this reason, very careful training is necessary on the part of
the teacher. If the child gets thoroughly interested in his
lessons, it will certainly stop the truancies. It is well worth
while to let the child see how he is getting ahead. The English
language is certainly not an easy one to learn, and much
patience is required to learn to use it correctly; but a
thoughtful teacher can by pointing out differences help the
pupil to remember the many points necessary in correct
reading and spelling<sic corr="."/></p>
          <p>Dictation exercises should begin with the First Reader,
and follow all thru the course in reading. It is very unfortunate
that reading in schools should be stopped so soon. If a child
can pronounce certain words correctly, and especially if he
has gone thru
<pb id="coppin70" n="70"/>
the Fourth Reader, it is supposed that he doesn't need any
more instruction in reading, but immediately passes into what
are considered more difficult subject's.</p>
          <p>This is the reason that more pupils do not acquire a taste
for reading, because as soon as they get thru the task of
pronouncing words and are just ready to enter upon the
delightful task of reading by sight, they are supposed to have
finished, and the work stops. Whereas, the pupil is just ready
to get the thoughts of others in an easy and intelligent way,
and he can learn the thoughts of the very best writers the
world has ever seen. And before he knows it they become a
part of himself, leading him onward and heavenward. Just as
when a person has mastered the scales and exercises on the
piano, he is not considered to have finished the course in
music, but to be in a position to be introduced to the works of
the great masters. After hearing a master of the instrument play
 “Home, Sweet Home” we make up our minds that we never
heard it before, and we never did. This matter of reading is far
more important than many of us think, because as I have said,
it is to continue all our lives long. A first-class reader may be
called an elocutionist, because he makes the thoughts of the
writer live again in the minds of those who hear. In the very
beginning, the child's eyes are trained to recognize the period
and comma when he sees them, and to use them correctly
when he is writing. The other marks of punctuation come in for
their share
<pb id="coppin71" n="71"/>
of attention when he is able to understand them. But besides
training the eye, we should remember that the ear should be
trained. Read a short sentence to the class and see who can
repeat it correctly; you will be astonished to see how few can
reproduce the sentence just as it was given. It is no wonder
that our Lord said, “Take heed how ye hear.”</p>
          <p>A distinguished teacher of a high school used to try his
entering classes, to see if they were prepared to take down
correctly the lectures which they were to receive, and he was
astonished to find how differently a simple sentence would be
written by them. The teacher can try his class himself by
asking them to write down any simple sentence which he may
give them. Disputes, nay quarrels, oftentimes are produced
because one person says I understood him to say so and so,
and another one says I did not understand it that way. If each
of these persons should write down what he thought was said,
the difference in the way they had heard would soon be
evident. Now, as lectures and sermons are given by hearing,
how necessary it is that the ear should be trained to repeat
correctly the sounds which fall upon it, and this is another
reason why the sounds of the letters should be distinctly
practiced by speakers and hearers, for there is a great
difference in the way people pronounce their words, and some
of them it is difficult to understand. We must be careful that
the final <hi rend="italics">d's</hi> and <hi rend="italics">t's,</hi>
<hi rend="italics">st</hi> and <hi rend="italics">st's</hi> should be carefully uttered: <hi rend="italics">v</hi>
and <hi rend="italics">w</hi> are made by different positions of the lips and the
<pb id="coppin72" n="72"/>
vocal organs should be practiced to show how they are to be
correctly uttered. As for <hi rend="italics">r</hi> it is rarely pronounced correctly, and
the same may be said of <hi rend="italics">th</hi> following an <hi rend="italics">s, </hi>or <hi rend="italics">c</hi> as, passeth,
ceaseth, rejoiceth. In further writing, I will put down the
difficult consonant combinations. If a child has an impediment
in his speech, the teacher must be very careful about forcing
him to read by himself before he has got over the worst of his
difficulties. By no means make him an object of fun to the
class, nor allow any pupil to make fun of him with his
peculiarities when the class is over.</p>
          <p>If the class has five times to read during the week, I
would take one of these times for recitations. After reciting, let
the pieces be written on the board, and here the eye can
correct whatever the ear gave wrong. Misspelled words,
misplaced capitals, and whatever else needs correction comes
under the teacher's eyes, and is written correctly.</p>
          <p>Great care should be taken in making the selections for
the children to learn. However short the piece may be, it
should include some moral principle, or something of beauty in
nature or art; but always something that the pupil can
understand. Pieces for the different grades are now selected
for the teacher, and this makes it easier to find wise selections.
But I would be very careful about the funny pieces, for we
should teach nothing but what inculcates some pretty
thought.</p>
          <p>Obedience to our Heavenly Father; love to parents,
<pb id="coppin73" n="73"/>
brothers and sisters; love to country, and kindness to
dumb animals; and many other selections which will hereafter
be given. Children learn poetry far more quickly than they do
prose, and so we select what we teach them largely from poets.</p>
          <p>There is a world of happy thoughts all about us, and if we
make wise selections in teaching, they are quite sure to be
remembered. And the grain of truth which they contain is as
encouraging in bringing forth fruit, as is the grain of mustard
seed. What we sow we reap, and there is no field more fertile
than that of a child's mind. If we plant tomatoes, we get
tomatoes; we certainly should not expect to find potatoes.
And so, if we plant beautiful thoughts and beautiful words in
the child's mind, we shall certainly get the same. But I do not forget
the parable of the tares of the field, for whatever we do, there
is always an active enemy who is doing his sowing at the same
time, and for this reason we must humble ourselves and pray
that the Lord of the Harvest may protect our child's mind from
the sower of evil; for in spite of all you may do, you will find
things in that child's mind which you never taught him, and
which you cannot account for.</p>
          <p>Teaching spelling by dictation exercises is the most
profitable way to get the child to learn what might otherwise
be dry and uninteresting.</p>
          <p>Facility in writing to dictation will train the ear to receive
sounds correctly and this is very important. How often do we
hear people say, “but that is not
<pb id="coppin74" n="74"/>
what I thought was said,” and so we have a  large class of
persons of whom it may be said, “Having ears they hear not,
neither do they understand.”</p>
          <p>The distinct utterance of the vocal elements must be
insisted upon, and those elements in their difficult
combinations which I have already mentioned.</p>
          <p>Sermons, lectures, and much of the instruction which we
receive must depend upon the ear for its faithful reproduction.
A professor giving a lecture at one time to a number of
students of different grades of instruction saw a little boy
industriously taking notes, and he asked one of the teachers to
let him have the child's paper when he was through.</p>
          <p>This was done, and he made the exclamation as he
glanced over the notes, “This is wonderful.” Then followed
the questions. In what class is this child and who is his
teacher?</p>
          <p>It is evident if the teacher corrects each dictation exercise
individually the other pupils will lack the valuable practice
which would follow looking over many papers themselves;
therefore having exchanged papers each one is called upon for
the correction of what he sees wrong on the paper which he
has, and the correct form is written on the board. It is also very
useful for pupils to learn to read the handwriting of different
persons.</p>
          <p>I have been asked if I approved teaching the rules of
spelling; not all of them by any means, because the pupil can
easily learn the rules by his own practice. But the rule for
monosyllables and words accented
<pb id="coppin75" n="75"/>
on the last syllable should be thoroughly learned, because it is
so frequently applied, as it refers to the formation of so many
words in the English language.</p>
          <p>About sixty per cent. of our words are old English or
Anglo-Saxon.</p>
          <p>Thirty per cent. are <sic corr="Latin">latin,</sic> five per cent. are Greek, and five
per cent. words taken from many other languages. Nearly all
the monosyllables in the language are old English and are very
plain words, and most easily understood. The pronouns, the
conjunctions, and nearly all the prepositions are old English,
and words of one syllable as we know are old English. These
form a sturdy stock like the people that first used them. The
Bible, Shakespeare and Bunyan's “Pilgrim's Progress” abound
in these words.</p>
          <p>They are strong and easy to be understood, whereas the
Latin words and the Greek are formed of many syllables, and
express different shades of thought and of mental states and
action. I suppose these are the “words of learned length and
thundering sound, which amazed the gaping rustics gathered
round,” and made the schoolmaster so famous.</p>
          <p>Scientific words are written in the Greek language.</p>
          <p>Always avoid using what are called big words when
writing on any topic, for they often do nothing but “Darken
counsel by words without knowledge.” Whereas the duty of
the speaker or writer is to get before his hearers or his readers
as clear an idea of his thoughts as he can.</p>
          <pb id="coppin76" n="76"/>
          <p>Now I am advocating a careful and thorough teaching of
spelling, if it is taught by dictation exercises, with a clear
knowledge of the use of words, whether it is in the elementary
school or the high school, because such instructions are
immensely valuable to pupils in all their writings.</p>
          <p>The printer at his desk or the writer for the paper, or
lawyer in his briefs, or the orator in his pleadings, will be
thankful for their thorough knowledge of words and their uses.
As the pupils advance in their lessons, it will be a very good
thing to have many little essays written on the power of words
to bless or destroy, and on the responsibility of those who use
them, for, “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy
words thou shalt be condemned.” Again it has been said, “A
wholesome tongue is a tree of life.” Let us therefore guard the
tongue with wise vigilance, and those whom we teach must be
inspired to think about the different effect of kind words and
unkind words, therefore to think before they use them. Many a
quarrel which has ended even in death started from one bitter
word. Many cases could be mentioned which would help to
make us more thoughtful and careful in our speech. The pupils
must notice the kind of words which are used by the best
writers in the books which they are studying, and in the
extracts from the best English writers which we are supposed
to give them in their weekly lessons. In a school in Africa I
found our little children studying the story of Hiawatha, and
just as those who have to live upon
<pb id="coppin77" n="77"/>
coarse food may show its effects in their body, so those
whose minds are fed upon pure food thought, whether of
Longfellow or Whittier or any other first-class poet, will soon
show in their spiritual development what they have been
studying. “Upon what meat hath this our Caesar fed that he
hath grown so great.” Can we not see the wisdom of that
question and look out for the mental food upon which our
children are feeding?</p>
          <p>There ought to be a censorship of the press in America,
that books that give foolish, unreal or evil ideas of life should
never be printed nor reach the eyes of our children. The so-called
yellow literature must be offset until it is scouted out of
the land by forming the taste for what is pure and good and
true in the youth.</p>
          <p>Fairy stories, the child delights in, and we must see that
what we give them is not too heavy for their young minds.</p>
          <p>Hans Christian Anderson has a grain of truth in every
one of his stories, and let us see to it that the child has that in
other stories which will build up strong moral fibre and
encourage him to love the truth. This shows why the teacher
should be well-prepared for all classes, but especially for the
lower classes, because for them he must supply such reading
as he knows will be profitable in the child's daily life. For the
kind of reading which is given should be equal to little classics
which he will probably remember all his life long, and his
taste being thus
<pb id="coppin78" n="78"/>
slowly formed for what is purest and best in literature, will
reject what is foolish and inferior.</p>
          <p>The teacher will thus be sending a pure stream to form
that “Well of English undefiled,” which in the future will
become a source of purer happiness than that which can be
found in the stories of many brilliant writers.</p>

          <head>HOW TO TEACH GRAMMAR.</head>
          <p>IT IS not necessary to wait until children can learn rules of
grammatical construction before we teach them how to
speak correctly. For be it known that children do not speak
according to rules, but according to what they hear.</p>
          <p>It will be observed that those who associate with persons
who use incorrect grammar will be very apt to fall into the same
habit themselves, while those who associate with persons who
speak correctly will be found to speak also correctly without
any instruction; and in this way you can often tell the kind of
associates that one is accustomed to have.</p>
          <p>It is for this reason that it is much easier to learn to speak
German in Germany, or to speak French in France, than in a
country where all the sounds you hear are those of the
English language. For this reason, too, teachers of German or
French should speak to their pupils in those languages, and
not be satisfied with simply reading it to them.</p>
          <p>Those who are able to have a German and French nurse
for their children will find that the child will 
<pb id="coppin80" n="80"/>
speak German to the German nurse and French to the French
nurse without difficulty; this ought to teach us something
about how languages are acquired.</p>
          <p>To speak a language correctly, and also to write it
correctly, are of the first importance. Therefore, at the
beginning we simply correct what is incorrect in the child's
speech, and do not square it by the rules of grammar until he is
able to understand it.</p>
          <p>We know the grammatical rules which are most likely to
be violated, such as singular verbs with plural subjects, and
vice versa; as, “Mary and Jane has not finished their lessons
yet”; or, “I has no more time to give to the subject.”</p>
          <p>Another common error is the past tense of the verb for
the past participle, as, “I seen him when he done it, and I
haven't saw him since.”</p>
          <p>A child should immediately be corrected when heard to
say: “Is you going to the fair?”  “I would have went had I been
invited.”</p>
          <p>Why should a child be allowed to say: It is me, it is him, it
is her, and not be corrected? Or, I didn't do nothing on my
work today; or, I written to my mother yesterday. Such errors
are passed unnoticed in children, when that is the very time
when corrections should be made and can be made most
effectively.</p>
          <p>The only way to teach them to write correctly is to have
them write. A good rule would be to have them write a little
essay once a week, and have it corrected, 
<pb id="coppin81" n="81"/>
seeing that all the rules of grammatical construction are
properly observed. See that you do not have a <emph rend="bold">singular
pronoun</emph> represented by a <emph rend="bold">plural antecedent,</emph> as, “let every one
attend to their own affairs.”</p>
          <p>The classes of <emph rend="bold">pronouns,</emph> being difficult to learn, should
be given at an early stage of the child's progress.</p>
          <p>There are four classes of pronouns—<emph rend="bold">personal, relative,
interrogative </emph>and <emph rend="bold">adjective.</emph></p>
          <p>The <emph rend="bold">adjective</emph> pronouns are themselves divided into four
classes, and it will help the child to remember them by a little
device like this, pidd, viz.: personal—my hat, her hand, his ball;
indefinite—none, any, all, whole, some; demonstrative—this, that—
with the plurals—these, those; distributives—each, every,
either, neither.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Personal pronouns</emph> are those which show by their forms
what <hi rend="italics">person</hi> is meant; I, thou, you, he, she, and it. They are
declined: nominative, I; possessive, my or mine; objective, me.
Plural, nominative, we; possessive, our or ours; objective, us.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Second person</emph>—Nominative, thou; possessive, thy or
thine; objective thee; plural, nominative, you; possessive,
your or yours; objective, your.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Third person</emph>—Nominative, it; possessive, its; objective, it.
Plural, nominative, they; possessive, their or theirs; objective,
them.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Relative pronouns</emph>—Nominative, who; possessive, whose;
objective, whom; there is no difference for the plural.</p>
          <pb id="coppin82" n="82"/>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Interrogatives</emph> who, which and what, are not declined at all.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Compound pronouns</emph> are formed by adding “self,” viz.:
myself, himself, themselves, etc. Ever and soever, added to the
relative who, gives it an indefinite force, as, whoever sins, must
suffer; whosoever will, let him come.</p>
          <p>With respect to the parts of speech, we may say that
anything we can see or think of is a <emph rend="bold">noun;</emph> as, house,
goodness. Any word that we can say something with—make a
statement, is a <emph rend="bold">verb.</emph> I can say I run, but cannot say I house.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Conjunctions</emph> are the joining words, and with a number of
these on hand, we can begin to make up sentences. John <hi rend="italics">and</hi>
James can go, <hi rend="italics">but</hi> Mary must help her mother, <hi rend="italics">unless</hi> she does
not need her. James is <hi rend="italics">as</hi> helpful <hi rend="italics">as</hi> John, <hi rend="italics">but</hi> Thomas works
faster <hi rend="italics">than</hi> either of them.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Prepositions</emph> always govern the objective case, therefore
the child must not be allowed to say, between I and you; nor,
between you and I, for between you and me.</p>
          <p>Teaching the <emph rend="bold">verb</emph> is very interesting. The attributes, viz.:
<emph rend="bold">voice, mood, tense, number</emph> and <emph rend="bold">person,</emph> are not equally
difficult. For instance, we know what <emph rend="bold">person</emph> and <emph rend="bold">number</emph> the
<emph rend="bold">verb</emph> is by the <emph rend="bold">person</emph> and <emph rend="bold">number</emph> of its subject, for they must
agree.</p>
          <p>We can think of three divisions of <emph rend="bold">time</emph> or <emph rend="bold">tense</emph>; as, I
write today, I wrote yesterday, I shall write tomorrow.</p>
          <pb id="coppin83" n="83"/>
          <p>There are three more <emph rend="bold">tenses,</emph> called <emph rend="bold">perfect,</emph> or finished: I
have written today, I had written when I saw you, and I shall
have written before I see you again.</p>
          <p>When a past act happens before some other, which is
also passed, we call it the <emph rend="bold">past perfect;</emph> as, I had written the
letter before the man called for it.</p>
          <p>When a future act happens before some other which is
also future, we call it <emph rend="bold">future perfect;</emph> as, I shall have finished
the dress before the lady will call for it. So much for tense.</p>
          <p>Now, as to <emph rend="bold">voice.</emph> We mean that form of the <emph rend="bold">verb</emph> which
shows whether the subject acts, or is acted upon; as, John
made the table; or, the table was made by John. Here the child
can be shown that only verbs which have an object in the
active can be put in the passive form, for the action passes
over from the subject to the object; hence the word <emph rend="bold">transitive</emph>
for the <emph rend="bold">verb,</emph> which simply means going across. When the <emph rend="bold">verb</emph>
has no object, it is called <emph rend="bold">intransitive;</emph> as, the baby sleeps, the
mother lies down for a little rest.</p>
          <p>Neuter, when referring to <emph rend="bold">verbs,</emph> means that the subject
neither acts nor is acted upon, and here comes in the use of
the verb to be—that is to say—to exist; as, Jane <emph rend="BOLD">is</emph> my sister,
those boys <emph rend="BOLD">are</emph> occupied. It is by means of this great verb to
be, that we can put any other verb in the passive voice, or
show an act continuing; as, the road <emph rend="BOLD">was</emph> constructed by the
engineer, the work <emph rend="BOLD">is</emph> finished: the cattle <emph rend="BOLD">are</emph> fed. Hence, to put
a verb in the passive voice, we conjugate the verb to be, and
write after all its moods and tenses the past
<pb id="coppin84" n="84"/>
participle of the verb; as, I am, I was, I shall be; I have been, I
had been, I shall have been. I may, can, or must be; might,
could, would or should be; I may, can or must have been; I
might, could, would or should have been; to be, to have been;
being, been and having been. Take any past participle of a
transitive verb and write after this synopsis, and you have put
the verb in the passive voice.</p>
          <p>Now, if after the same synopsis we put the present
participle of the verb, we shall have the progressive form of the
verb, and not the passive voice; as, I am writing, they are
writing, we shall be writing, etc.</p>
          <p>Mistakes are often made when persons see parts of the
verb to be, and conclude that the verb is in the passive voice;
but the test is, does the subject act? For while active and
passive are shown by the form of the verb, it is really the
subject that is active or passive.</p>
          <p>We have one other attribute to account for, namely <emph rend="bold">mood,</emph>
which means the <emph rend="bold">manner</emph> of expressing our thought; as, the
indicative, which declares a thing to be so; the potential,
showing that a thing may be so; the subjunctive, noting a
condition; the infinitive, which cannot be used as a verb at all,
but expresses the thought in a general or indefinite way, and is
therefore used as a neuter noun.</p>
          <p>Verbs have three participles, present, as writing; past, as
written; perfect, as having written. The same
<pb id="coppin85" n="85"/>
participles in the passive voice are, being written, written,
having been written.</p>
          <p>The child will observe that the middle participle—written—
has the same form in both the active and passive voice, hence
we can only tell which voice is meant by the context.</p>
          <p>The past passive participle is very useful, being a
shortened form, not carrying with it the sign of tense or voice;
as, the book <emph rend="bold">written</emph> by your brother was readily sold. Observe
how frequently this form of participle is used by writers. For an
illustration from Thanatopsis: “<emph rend="bold">Scourged</emph> to his dungeon, but
<emph rend="bold">sustained</emph> and <emph rend="bold">soothed</emph> by an unfaltering trust.”</p>
          <p>Shortened forms of expression are desirable, when they
are not ambiguous. Many long-drawn-out sentences might be
shortened and made more compact and forcible if the use of
the participles were better known.</p>
          <p>There are few points relating to tense and mood which the
teacher will do well to call the pupils' attention to; as, <emph rend="bold">shall</emph> in
the first person denotes futurity, but in the second and third,
determination; whereas, <emph rend="bold">will,</emph> in the first person denotes
determination, but in the second and third, futurity. To
conjugate the future indicative correctly, we must say: I shall
go, you will go, he will go. But if I say, I will go, you shall go,
he shall go, it denotes determination.</p>
          <p>Again, we must notice that the past tense refers to what
is completely past; as, I saw your brother yesterday. We
would not say, “I saw your brother
<pb id="coppin86" n="86"/>
today,” as the time has not completely passed; I saw him
yesterday, I have seen him today.</p>
          <p>Again, we should not say, I intended to have written;
but, I intended to write. I wanted to have seen the show,
should be, I wanted to see the show. In each case the acts are
present, with reference to the past time.</p>
          <p>The old form of the subjunctive mood is passing out of
use, and we are using the conditional indicative. Instead of
saying, if he <emph rend="bold">return</emph> by tomorrow, we say, if he <emph rend="bold">returns.</emph></p>
          <p>The form of the present subjunctive is a contracted
future; as, if he be innocent, means, if he shall be. Following
the Latin construction, however, propositions which are
impossible, or contrary to fact, should be expressed by the
imperfect subjunctive; as, if I were you.</p>
          <p>There are many other points in grammar which the
teacher will find it necessary to explain to his pupils, if they
would acquire the habit of correct speaking.</p>
          <p>It is a good rule to remember that the distributive
pronouns, each, every, either, neither, are always third person,
singular number, and require the verb and pronoun to agree
with them accordingly.</p>
          <p>With reference to subject and predicate—and their
modifiers—of sentences, they can be brought more clearly
before us by a diagram than by an analysis with words.</p>
          <pb id="coppin87" n="87"/>
          <p>Here is a little device for remembering the parts of speech:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>A noun is the name of anything, </l>
            <l>As <emph rend="bold">school,</emph> or <emph rend="bold">garden, hoop,</emph> or <emph rend="bold">swing.</emph></l>
            <l>Adjectives tell the kind of noun; </l>
            <l>As <emph rend="bold">great, small, pretty, white</emph> or <emph rend="bold">brown.</emph></l>
            <l>Conjunctions join the words together;</l>
            <l>As, bread <emph rend="bold">and</emph> butter; wind <emph rend="bold">or</emph> weather.</l>
            <l>Verbs tell of something to be done; </l>
            <l>As <emph rend="bold">sing,</emph> or <emph rend="bold">play</emph> or <emph rend="BOLD">skip,</emph> or <emph rend="bold">run.</emph></l>
            <l>A preposition stands before</l>
            <l>A noun; as <emph rend="bold">in</emph> or <emph rend="bold">through</emph> a door <sic corr="."/></l>
            <l>How things are done the adverbs tell; </l>
            <l>As, <emph rend="bold">slowly, quickly, ill</emph> or <emph rend="bold">well.</emph></l>
            <l>An exclamation shows surprise; </l>
            <l>As, <emph rend="bold">ah!</emph> how pretty! <emph rend="bold">oh!</emph> how wise! </l>
            <l>Three little words you often see </l>
            <l>Are articles; <emph rend="bold">a</emph> or <emph rend="bold">an</emph> and <emph rend="bold">the.</emph></l>
            <l>Instead of nouns the pronoun stands; </l>
            <l><emph rend="bold">Your</emph> book, <emph rend="bold">his</emph> work, <emph rend="bold">her</emph> hat, <emph rend="bold">my</emph> hand. </l>
            <l>The whole are called nine parts of speech;</l>
            <l>Which reading, writing, speaking, teach.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>This little bit of poetry saves us from many definitions,
and it has helped many pupils who have understood it.</p>
          <p>In arranging our sentences, we remember the kind of
verbs we are using, as transitive verbs require
an object to complete their meaning; as, the carpenters
finished their work yesterday.</p>
          <p>
            <figure entity="coppi87">
              <p>[Sentence Diagram]</p>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>The verbs that do not take an object are complete
<pb id="coppin88" n="88"/>
in themselves. Such are chiefly verbs of locomotion; as, Mary
has gone to her mother.</p>
          <p>
            <figure entity="copp88-1">
              <p>[Sentence Diagram]</p>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>These are simple sentences, but when they are compound
or complex, or when the verb is in the imperative mood, they
are not so easily diagramed; the same is true when there are
many modifiers both of the subject and the predicate; and it is
important to know what clause a connective introduces; as, the
day seems gloomy, but the sun is shining behind the clouds.</p>
          <p>
            <figure entity="copp88-2">
              <p>[Sentence Diagram]</p>

              <p>[Sentence Diagram]</p>
            </figure>
          </p>
          <p>The pupil may remember that whatever answers the
question, when, where or how, is adverbial in character; but,
whatever answers the question, of what
<pb id="coppin89" n="89"/>
kind, is adjective in character, especially relative pronouns,
because they relate to some preceding noun, for a relative
cannot represent an adjective.</p>
          <p>The pupil will do well to notice how useful the word <hi rend="italics">that</hi>
is, for as a relative, it can relate to persons, lower animals and
things; as, the man that you saw, and the cart that he rode in,
brought back the dog that had run away.</p>
          <p>It is also used as a connective, and as a demonstrative; as, I saw
that that book would not answer the purpose; the first <emph rend="bold">that</emph>
being a connective, and the second a demonstrative.</p>
          <p>We give children a great deal of poetry to learn; this
involves the question of metre—or measure. To read poetry
correctly, the right words must be accented.</p>
          <p>In scanning a line of poetry, a measure consisting of one
foot is called a monometre; two feet, a dimetre; three feet; a
trimetre; four feet, a tetrametre; five feet, a pentametre; six feet,
a hexametre, etc.</p>
          <p>The iambus consists of a short and a long syllable, and
this foot is principally the one used in English verse. To
illustrate:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l> “From all that dwell below the skies,</l>
            <l>Let the Creator's praise arise.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>This is the long metre, and consists of all iambic
tetrametres.</p>
          <p>The common metre consists of tetrametres and trimetres
alternating; as,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l> “Jerusalem my happy home,</l>
            <l>Name ever dear to me.”</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="coppin90" n="90"/>
          <p>The short metre is three iambic trimetres and one iambic
tetrametre; as,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Great is the Lord, our God,</l>
            <l>And let His praise be great;</l>
            <l>He makes His churches His abode,</l>
            <l>His most delightful seat.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The iambic pentametre is used in epic verse, and
corresponds to the Latin hexametre; as,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Stretch forth thy hand to God, 'tis not for thee </l>
            <l>To question aught, nor all His purpose see. </l>
            <l>The hand that led thee through the dreary night, </l>
            <l>Does not thy counsel need when comes the light.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The opposite of the iambus is the trochee. The dactyl—
Greek for finger—has one long and two short syllables.</p>
          <p>The opposite of the dactyl is the anapaest, two short and
one long syllable.</p>
          <p>A beautiful illustration of the trochaic metre is
Longfellow's Psalm of Life:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l> “Tell me not in mournful numbers,</l>
            <l>Life is but an empty dream;</l>
            <l>For the soul is dead that slumbers</l>
            <l>And things are not what they seem.”</l>
          </lg>

          <head>HOW TO TEACH GEOGRAPHY</head>
          <p>I THINK a great mistake is made by giving to those who begin
geography a book to begin the study. As we are going to
teach about this earth, its form, etc., why not begin with a ball?
But as the child will find it difficult to conceive of a round
object, let us make for him the continents of North and South
America on a board, showing him where the mountains and
rivers are found, and having him help us all that he can, putting
the Rocky Mountains in their place and then the Sierras, and
lastly the Coast Range, so called because they are so near the
coast and accounting for the fact that the rivers are very short
on that side. The teacher will need some strings of different
lengths to show the Mississippi and Missouri Rivers, but all
this must go on very slowly, for the child must learn what we
mean by elevations and depressions. He must make the Great
Lakes of North America and show their outlet, the St. Lawrence
River, carrying their waters into the Atlantic Ocean. Rivers
must run as the land slopes, and as the Mississippi flows
south and the St. Lawrence flows in an easterly direction, it
shows there must
<pb id="coppin92" n="92"/>
be a high ridge of land between them, so that one
river is turned south and the other in an easterly
direction. </p>
          <p>Little by little the child must learn the names of the bodies
of water; why one is called a river, and all that he can tell you
about a river. Names of bodies of land and water are very
interesting to the child when he himself has made the picture of
them on his map and can see the difference between a strait
and an isthmus, the formation and use being the same, but one
is water and the other is land; the difference between an island
and a lake, one being land surrounded by water and the other
being water surrounded by land. Little by little he goes over
both continents, learning the names of the bodies of land and,
of course, learning to spell them correctly. When we have thus
prepared both continents, we lay off the bounds of the people
who inhabit this land.</p>
          <p>We suppose that the child has learned something about
climate, why some parts are cold and some hot, and so, when
he plants his people in the northern parts of the continents.
<sic corr="Now is a">good</sic> time for him to be introduced to the Esquimaux, and,
traveling farther south, he finds different people living in
different parts, differing in their appearances or looks and in
their occupations.</p>
          <p>The study now becomes more interesting, as the child
can fill out for himself the characteristics and the industries of
the people who live in the different part, he knows that it is
very cold there.</p>
          <pb id="coppin93" n="93"/>
          <p>A very good picture of the globe can be made by a
newspaper on which a line may be drawn showing the
equator, then drawing another line a quarter of the way from
the top, we may lay off the cold zone; and the torrid or hot
zone, lying on both sides of the equator, can be equally well
shown. Between the very hot and the very cold is the one
which we call temperate, and now we can teach about the
different seasons, the very hot and the very cold, having only
two.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, constant map drawing has prepared the
pupil to draw upon the board that part of the country in which
he lives, and another world of research and inquiry is open to
him, and now he finds out facts for himself without having
them forced upon him. When the pupils come into the
geography room, there should be pictures of different lands,
and as many specimens of the objects about them as they can
get. Many questions in physical geography, that is, the
geography of nature, will come up in the beginning lessons of
geography, and are oftentimes very interesting; as, how does
the water get into the clouds from the land; into the river; from
the river into the sea; from the sea into the air; into the clouds;
from the clouds upon the land again, and from the land into the
river? Why the water of the Gulf of Mexico is warm? Some
have said there are hot springs of water at its base.</p>
          <p>The lightning and thunder form a fruitful subject to teach
the children all about electricity, and
<pb id="coppin94" n="94"/>
the man who discovered that lightning and electricity are the
same.</p>
          <p>In teaching mathematical geography, the teacher will need
two circles which he can easily make out of ordinary wire. The
number of degrees in a circle, the half of one, the quarter of
one, can easily be taught. That the earth is round cannot be
demonstrated to very young people, but people have traveled
around it, starting from one point and coming back to the same,
and people have sailed around it. Now the distance around all
round bodies, is three hundred and sixty degrees, and the half,
one hundred and eighty, and the quarter is ninety. We know
that all these lines upon the surface of the earth are merely
imaginary, and are placed on our globes for convenience. For
instance, we take a line to reach around the earth equally from
the north and south poles, as we call them; and we call this the
equator.</p>
          <p>We know that when the sun shines farthest north, it will
reach exactly twenty-three and a half degrees over the north
pole, and we put a circle there to mark this distance, and call it
the arctic circle. Now when it begins to recede or go back, as it
were, and reaches the southernmost limit, it shines twenty-three 
and a half degrees over the south pole, and we draw a
line, which, being opposite to the Arctic, we call the Antarctic
circle. Again, when the rays strike down perpendicularly, we
notice that they never go farther than twenty-three and a half
degrees north of our middle line, and twenty-three and a half
degrees south
<pb id="coppin95" n="95"/>
of our middle line, or equator. We speak of the sun being
overhead here at twelve o'clock, but the sun is never overhead
out of the tropics. We call these limitation lines tropics, or
turning points, because when the sun gets to one, it seems to
turn back to the other. This limitation of the sun's vertical rays
on the north is called the tropic of cancer, and the opposite
one on the south is called the tropic of capricorn. Now, as
cancer means a crab, and capricorn means a goat, why in the
world should these circles be thus named? We shall have to
answer this question by referring to the ancients' study of
astronomy.</p>
          <p>The heavens were a fruitful source of study to the
ancients; and the groups of stars, which are constellations,
received certain names, according to whatever they seemed to
resemble. The group toward the north looked to them like a
crab, and the one toward the south looked to them like a goat.</p>
          <p>I found an old table, and drew a line upon it to represent
the equator. I found some sand, and having drawn an outline
of the eastern and western continents, I took the sand and
made the elevations and depressions on both sides. The
children could see where the tropic of cancer struck on the
western continent, and trace it across to the eastern.</p>
          <p>Keeping such an illustrative map before the eyes of the
pupils, they can get a practical idea of the relative position and
climate of places on both continents. Questions of latitude and
longitude can best be settled in this way.</p>
          <pb id="coppin96" n="96"/>
          <p>When we take from ninety degrees the limitation of the
Arctic circle (twenty-three degrees on the south being the limit
of the vertical rays of the sun) we have left forty-three degrees,
the width of the north temperate zone, bounded on the north by
the Arctic circle, and on the south by the Antarctic circle, and
on the north by the Tropic of Capricorn. We find four seasons
in the temperate zone, which we call Spring, Summer, Autumn
and Winter; and the torrid zone, two, the wet and the dry; and
in the frigid zone a very short summer and a long, cold winter.
We have called the spaces thus marked off by rays of the sun
zones, or belts, because they are parallel portions of the earth's
surface. The Eastern Hemisphere is more difficult to mould and
draw than the Western, and it is well to have them both on the
other lines put in their places, and then the pupil can compare
the climate on the Western Hemisphere. Having the zones
marked off, they can easily tell us how many seasons each one
of those countries has. I should like the children to know
where the words arctic, cancer and capricorn come from. A
constellation is a bunch of stars, or a number of stars taken
together, which form a certain figure in the heavens. For
instance, the children have all seen in the heavens, probably,
what we call the big dipper, and the little dipper, because they
look like dippers, having a bowl and a curved handle. Another
name for these two constellations is Ursa Major and Ursa
Minor; or, big bear and little bear.</p>
          <p>A few lessons in astronomy upon the simplest
<pb id="coppin97" n="97"/>
facts will open the door to interest the children, and when
they are able to study the great science of astronomy they can
learn a great deal more. With two circles made of wire, the
teacher can represent the equator.</p>
          <p>Traveling on any round body is measured in degrees,
minutes, seconds, etc. As the sun moves from west to east, but
seems to travel from east to west, we can show that every
fifteen degrees on the earth's surface, going toward the east,
bring us nearer the sun by one hour of time, so we can go on
and show that when we have traveled seventy-five degrees
toward the east, we will find the time at the end of our journey
to be five hours later than at the place we started from.
Therefore, as we travel toward the east, which may be called
the rising sun, we will find that our time is faster than that
which we left, and we can keep on that way until we get half
way around the globe, and then we shall find that when it is ten
o'clock at night over on the other side of the globe it is ten
o'clock in the morning on this side. Many illustrations should
be given about time to make it plain to children about the
movements of the sun, and then they will understand what we
mean by standard time. The most delightful part of geography
is when we can begin teaching by journeys. Now tomorrow we
are going to make a visit to England, and we will ask the
children to find out how long it will take us to get there; and
whether we go by land or sea; and what great city should we
go to see when we
<pb id="coppin98" n="98"/>
get there; how we should get across the great Atlantic Ocean;
how many miles wide it is, what city we would start from on
this side, and what line of steamships would we take and why;
the different kind of sailing vessels.</p>
          <p>And then the story of Columbus, and how he first came
over will be in order. How long it took him, and how long it
takes one of our vessels now. How much coal it takes to last
one of these steamers across the ocean, and what is the
average time for crossing. It will be seen that the teacher must
be well furnished with information of a practical character.
Keeping the moulded map of the two continents before the
children's eyes, they can readily trace their way from one
country to another, and tell where they could go by land, and
how far they must go by water. How the people of different
countries are employed is a very important subject, for we
mean, how do they get their living; how do they find the
means of sustenance?</p>
          <p>Then comes the question, why are some nations
employed in agriculture and why some are engaged in
manufacturing, and some in mining, and some in trade and
transportation; and what we mean by those engaged in
commerce, foreign and domestic; and in this way we call
attention to different occupations of the people who live on
the earth. The difference in the clothing and food of people in
the different countries will also claim our attention. And when
we get ready to make these imaginary journeys, each child can
be taught that it must pack its trunk with the kind of
<pb id="coppin99" n="99"/>
clothes it will probably need, and this will make a great deal of
merriment. This is caused by the children not understanding
about climate, the difference in the towns on the sea coast, and
the towns in the interior. This also calls up the question where
all the great cities on the globe are located, and why. The
history of the people on the globe is a most interesting one.
Where did the people of our own country, the Western
settlers, come from; and why did they come? Little by little the
children learn much about our country from their geographical
travels, and the story of Columbus is like a fairy tale. How he
set out westward to find a northwest passage to India. For he
believed that the earth was round and he knew nothing of the
great continent lying between. So starting out, he was three
months with his three little ships sailing about on the ocean,
and when he came to the American continents he supposed he
had come to India, and for that reason he called the first land
he came to, the West Indies, and the island, he called
Hispaniola, or Little Spain. It was not until Amerigo discovered
the mainland that it was known that not an island, but a whole
new world had been discovered by Columbus. The history of
this great man is full of romance, and the teacher has a fine
field to get the children to thinking and to draw out their
thoughts when this subject comes up. Why had sailors always
gone eastward when they wanted to go to India? Why had
they never ventured beyond what is called the pillars of
Hercules, that is, beyond the strait of Gibraltar, leading
<pb id="coppin100" n="100"/>
out into the Atlantic Ocean? An old writer has said: For
years and years mankind had confined himself to the
Mediterranean Sea, and there we lived like frogs in a pond.</p>
          <p>The history of the compass must now be studied, for by
its invention mankind was no longer confined to any one place
of the earth's surface, but the needle, always pointing to the
north, became a sure guide when they were looking for a
strange place; and so Columbus could tell in what direction he
was sailing, because then men knew the use of the compass.
The question may arise, why does the needle point to the
north? It is because of the magnetic attraction of the north
pole. The compass is divided into thirty-two parts, and when a
sailor knows all of these points he is said to be able to box the
compass.</p>
          <p>Little by little, discovery has traced the lightning to its
source. Benjamin Franklin found this out, and as soon as men
knew what it was, they made machines and harnessed its
powerful force into their service, and made it to carry their
messages over the whole world, and by it we talk to people
hundreds of miles away; aye, thousands of miles away. And
when men stop wrangling and hating one another, they will
begin to learn more of scientific law, and we may have wireless
telephone, not only extending over this earth, but extending to
the moon and to Mars.</p>
          <p>We are now trembling on the eve of a great discovery
which I have said God will show us when we delight to know
more of His way. At first it was
<pb id="coppin101" n="101"/>
thought we could only talk by the telephone a few miles apart,
but now we have the long distance telephone. Who would
have ever believed that cables could be laid in the deep ocean
to carry the telegraphic message. But by wireless telegraphy
the cable may now be displaced, and it is not too much to
suppose that it will not be many years before we shall be able
to talk with the people on Mars, and if there are none in the
moon we shall be able to know it! but we can easily imagine
that all the great planets swinging in
space are not there for nothing. When we use the Orrery, we
see the position of this earth among the other heavenly
bodies, and we see that it is so small and insignificant in size
that it looks like a mere ball of
putty, and yet we allow our thoughts and aspirations to be
limited by its twenty-five thousand miles of circumference.</p>
          <p>Unholy ambition never succeeds well in anything, nor will
the Great Creator of the universe reveal His secrets to those
whose only desire is to shine in the eyes of men. But the light
of Heaven will shine all around the man who humbly and fervently 
asks for more light, more light.</p>

          <p>There are only two things we can do in arithmetic, put
together and take apart. <emph rend="bold">Multiplication</emph> is a quick way to <emph rend="bold">add</emph>
and <emph rend="bold">Division</emph> is a quick way to <emph rend="bold">subtract.</emph> Show these two
processes by several examples.</p>
          <p>It has often been asked, how shall I begin numbers? We
begin by counting and making the numbers up to ten. Be
careful, in making numbers, to make them neatly. Do not make
a 4 like an x nor a 7 like a 9; nor make a 5 with the stem flying in
the air. The children can count, for practice, any article in the
room. Begin as soon as possible the <emph rend="bold">Multiplication table,</emph> for that is one of the best instruments that I know of in teaching
arithmetic. Problems may easily be learned in <emph rend="bold">simple multiplication</emph> which we would suppose to belong to higher
arithmetic. I do not see why we should not go from 1 to 25,
although it is usual to stop at 12. Teaching the <emph rend="bold">squares</emph> and
<emph rend="bold">cubes</emph> found in them is very helpful, and assists in solving
many apparently difficult problems.</p>
          <pb id="coppin104" n="104"/>
          <p>Counting by 5's and counting by 10's backward and
forward. Making change by running up to a naught or a five.
Finding cost of simple articles in a grocery.</p>
          <p>We find that Foreigners seldom make a mistake in handling
our money in the markets and stores. Illustration: You buy
something that comes to 33 cents; 33 and 2, 35; and 5, 40; and
10, 50; and you gave 50 cts., and you know you have your right
change. 10, 5, 2 equals 17. The other, and less convenient way,
would be to put down 33 under 50 and <emph rend="bold">subtract.</emph></p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Define powers and roots.</emph> Let us see what powers we can
get out of the tables 3's, 4's, 5's, etc. Whenever we <emph rend="bold">multiply</emph> a number into itself we get a power, as: 5 5s, 3 3s, 8 8s, 7 7s. <emph rend="bold">Roots of numbers</emph> are those <emph rend="bold">equal factors,</emph> which <emph rend="bold">multiplied</emph> together will produce them. Cube root, one of the 3 equal factors, 
square root one of the 2 equal factors, as: square root of 64 is 8. Cube
root of 64 is 4.</p>
          <p>In finding the cost of simple articles in play store, etc., we
found it necessary to give good attention to dates.</p>
          <p>How many threes can you get out of 21, how many out of
24, 36? How many fives can you get out of 15, how many out of
20, how many out of 40? Then divisors with remainders over,
as: How many fives can you get out of 17, how many out of 29,
and what over? As, I bought 4 lbs. of sugar at 5 cts. a pound.
How much change have I from a quarter? I bought
<pb id="coppin105" n="105"/>
5 lbs. of sugar at 51/2 cts. lb. How much change ought I to have
from 25 cts.?</p>
          <p>So many times a number to find it. <emph rend="bold">Fractional part</emph> of a number to find it, as: 12 is 4 times what number? 3 times, 6
times, 12 times. These same questions must be asked with
other multiples. 8 is 1/3 of what number? 1/4, 1/5, etc. Now put the
two together and ask, 12 is 3/6 of what number? 4/6 of what
number?</p>
          <p>I have shown how much can be taught by using the
multiplication table as an instrument and how it will lead out in
higher arithmetic. After reading and writing numbers up to ten,
go on to a hundred.</p>
          <p>And now we must teach the difference in value
according to place. To show that the first period is ones,
second is thousands, third is millions. 100,100,100.</p>
          <p>Show how these differ according to the period they are in.
Write a hundred in each one. The first is 100 ones, the second
is 100 thousand, the third, 100 millions.</p>
          <p>In order to read a number correctly, separate it into
periods of three figures each, beginning at the right. Remember
that the first period is ones, second thousands, third millions,
fourth billions, fifth trillions, and so on.</p>
          <p>Extension means the act of drawing out; extension in one
direction gives a line; extension in two directions gives a
surface; extension in three directions gives a solid. So we
notice that linear measure is the measure of lines. A surface has
two dimensions, length
<pb id="coppin106" n="106"/>
and breadth. So we measure surface by square
measure.</p>
          <p><emph rend="BOLD">A solid</emph> has three dimensions, length, breadth and
thickness; so we measure solids by cubic measure.</p>
          <p><emph rend="BOLD">Capacity</emph> means extent of room or space. There are two
measures of capacity, liquid and dry measures.</p>
          <p>The distance around an angular object is called
<emph rend="BOLD">perimeter.</emph> The distance around a round object is called
<emph rend="BOLD">circumference.</emph> In order to find the perimeter of a rectangle,
add the length to the breadth and multiply by two. When you
add the length and breadth together, we get half way around,
and so we multiply by two to get the whole distance.</p>
          <p>In order to get the area of a rectangle, multiply the length
by breadth; as, give to each unit in length one unit in breadth,
and we shall then have 12 square units; there will be as many
rows of these as there are units in the breadth. If one row
contains 8 units, twelve rows contain 12 x 8 units, or 96 units. If
we should multiply the length by the breadth, we should have
the same result. To find the number of cubic inches, multiply
length, breadth and height together. One of the best ways to
get work quickly given out is to have it written down on manila
paper.</p>
          <p>First, the board is clean; second, one division is sent to
the board; third, while they are facing the teacher, some pupil
passes the papers around. There must be no time for picking or
choosing. Then each one turns to the board and begins to
work. The teacher must keep his class doing regular work in reviewing
<pb id="coppin107" n="107"/>
exercises. One-half of the work should be reviewed
every day. When children first begin to think about a subject
they cannot possibly take in all at once; here is where teachers
often make mistakes. When a child is learning a rule, he has
only begun. He will learn more little by little. Every time the
review is given the children learn something new about the
subject. There should be frequent mental exercise. A teacher
must think more comprehensively than his pupil.</p>
          <p>Reading signs is very important, especially for pupils
who are beginning, as:
8 + 4, 8 - 4, 8 ÷ 4, or 10 - 5, 10 ÷ 5, 10 + 5. Letting the child
see the different operations.</p>
          <p>How can a teacher teach mental arithmetic and
practical arithmetic at the same time? About forty-five minutes
is given to a class in arithmetic, and if we should add to this
fifteen minutes to mental drill, it would give more time to
arithmetic than its share, considering the other studies.</p>
          <p>But if the teacher separates the class in two divisions,
then one set can be doing practical work while the other is
getting mental drill.</p>
          <p>The mental drill is exceedingly important.</p>
          <p>The teacher can do a great deal in ten minutes and give a
variety of exercises very useful in building up mental power.</p>
          <p>The second division of the class can be doing practical
work at the board or while seated.</p>
          <p>There should be two ways in examining a class
<pb id="coppin108" n="108"/>
in arithmetic. First—one is to see if the pupil can handle large
numbers and is accurate in his work, and then we must not
give more than four or five examples.</p>
          <p>Second—We must examine in power of reasoning; then we
can give ten problems with numbers of two places, as: Find the
sum of 1/2 of 20; 1/3 of 18; 1/5 of 40 cts.</p>
          <p>John earns one day 1/2 of a dollar, another day 1/10 of $1.00;
he afterward spent 1/4 of $1.00.</p>
          <p>If rice is 9 cts. a lb., how many lbs. can you get for 96 cts.?</p>
          <p>John has 20 cts., and this is 2/3 of Mary's money; how
much has Mary? And many such simple examples should be
given, which will show you how much your pupil can reason.</p>
          <p>From the sum of 20 and 30 take their difference.</p>
          <p>Multiply the sum of 8 + 6 by their difference and add 4 to
the result. Divide the sum of 4 and 16 by 1/3 of their difference.</p>
          <p>From the product of five times 8 take three times 2 and add
50 to the result.</p>
          <p>To the quotient 27 divided by 3 add their product plus
their sum.</p>
          <p>25 ÷ 5416 X 2 - 6 ÷ 2 = ?
25 - 5 X 5 + 10 - 2 X 5 = ?</p>
          <p>It is never necessary to wait and do nothing, but while we
are waiting we can always find something else to do, and so
make good use of the time. Remember Washington Irving, who
became a learned man by
<pb id="coppin109" n="109"/>
using his spare minutes for reading. And remember Elihu
Burritt; he is called the learned blacksmith. During his spare
moments he learned fifty languages. Let us learn what to do
with odds and ends of time. When the sum and difference of
two numbers is given, to find the numbers, add the difference
to the sum, and we get twice the greater number. When we 
have twice the number and divide by two, we get the number.</p>
          <p>One fractional part of a number is one fractional
part of another number. Several fractional parts of numbers are
several fractional parts of another number, as: 1/4 of 20 is 1/7 of
what number; 3/4 of 20 is 5/9 of what number?</p>
          <p>Beginning children in numbers is harder than any other
part of the work. First, they must be taught to count
consecutively up to one hundred, and at the
same time the counting must be done with objects: rose leaves,
grains of corn or the objects in the room.</p>
          <p>Addition, multiplication, division made all at once:
No good teacher will think of following the book. Take any
number of objects, say 10, with a board in front; objects laid out
in piles of ten. Take one away, count the number left, then 9 + 1
= 10, until the child understands. Take 3, 5 away, see what is
left. Then separate ten in five equal parts, some one making
piles of two, and see how many piles are in 10. The child sees
five piles with two each equal 10, or, 5 X 2 = 10. Alter this,
abstract reasoning immediately; show use of it. As, bread is 5
cts. a loaf, how many can we get
<pb id="coppin110" n="110"/>
for 10 cts.? One yeast cake at 2 cts. and one loaf of bread from
10, how many have you left? And many problems of like
character.</p>
          <p>The teacher who is a master of the multiplication table will
find he has a means of investigation in arithmetic and algebra
all ready to his hand. The factors which produce certain
products, the squares and cubes hidden away in their depths,
all come to light before they are hidden away in some
apparently difficult problem in proportion or percentage.</p>
          <p>The teacher who is expert in the use of multiplication table
can easily teach involution and evolution, proportion and other
apparently difficult processes in arithmetic and algebra in this
simple way. Now is the time to teach the square of the sum, the
square of the difference and the rectangle of the sum and
difference, thus preparing for algebra. It is well just here to
define what we mean by the numerical square and the
geometrical square. The numerical square being the product of
the two equal factors, and the geometrical square an equilateral
rectangle; also the numerical cube being the product of three
equal factors, and the geometrical cube a solid bounded by six
equal squares.</p>
          <p>The teacher must go into his room, having prepared the
work in arithmetic and algebra as far as the learners have
advanced. Do not be satisfied with the few problems which
their books upon the subject present. The teacher should have
consulted ten or twenty
<pb id="coppin111" n="111"/>
books on the same subject and come to his class prepared to
test the children's knowledge upon what they are learning, and
their ability to understand the principles and to handle the
work with success.</p>
          <p>Our knowledge in mathematics is largely increased by what
we know of the right-angle triangle and of the ratio between
numbers, and I have said this can be taught when we are
studying the multiplication table, as: 5 : 7 :: 15 : some number.
Now it is common in proportion to say, when three terms are
given, multiply the means together and divide by the other
extreme, or multiply the extremes together and divide by the
given means. Now 5 is the same part of 7 that 15 is of some
number. We know that 5 is 5/7 of 7, so 15 must be 5/7 of some
number. If 15 is 5/7, 1/7 must be 1/5 of 15, or 3. And 7/7, or the
whole, will be 7 X 3, or 21; therefore 5 : 7 :: 15 : 21. So we see the
great importance of teaching what part one number is of
another as leading out afterwards to ratio and proportion.</p>
          <p>A good rule for long division: Try the first figures of the
divisor into the first figures of the dividend, and about as many
times as it is contained, about so many times the whole divisor
will be contained into the whole dividend. You may have heard
of the poet who made a coop for his chickens. He made a big
door for the big chickens and a little door for the little chickens.
Now, which door was not necessary?</p>
          <p>Numbers in English are written upon a geometrical
progression of ten, and a number standing in
<pb id="coppin112" n="112"/>
front of a number is ten times greater than the number back of it
and a hundred times greater than the one back of that, and a
thousand times greater than the first one, and standing in the
fifth place, ten thousand times greater. This rapid increase
soon places the head numbers out of sight of the back ones.
That is the reason we call the head numbers the big chickens.
We call the first figures of the divisor the big chickens and the
corresponding one of the dividend the big door. In long
division, if you have a remainder greater than the divisor, then
the figure in the quotient is too small. A very useful rule in
mathematics is to always prove your subtraction. Instead of
using the terms subtrahend and minuend, etc., say, add what
you take away to what you had left, and if you get what you
had at first the work is right. It will be some time before they
completely realize what you take away is the subtrahend, and
what you have left the remainder, and minuend the sum to be
diminished.</p>
          <p>To add, subtract, multiply and divide fractions need not be
at all difficult. We mean by reducing to a common denominator,
making the parts equal in size. We can then see how many we
have, find the difference between them or see how many times
one is contained into another. When we are reducing to a
common denominator we are multiplying fractions, as: We have
one apple divided into 3 parts and another divided into 2 parts;
we will take one of the 3 equal parts, which is 1/3, and one of the
2 equal parts, which
<pb id="coppin113" n="113"/>
is 1/2. We will cut each third into 2 equal parts, thus getting
1/2 of 1/3 and we see that the whole unit consists of six of those
parts; so 1/2 of 1/3 is 1/6. Then we cut each half in three
equal parts; the unit will consist of 6 of those parts, and we see
that 1/3 of 1/2 = 1/6 of a whole. Now if we had 1/3 and 1/2 of
anything we can see that it is 5/6 of the whole.</p>
          <p>We also see that 3/6-2/6=1/6. Again 1/2 ÷ 1/3=3/6 ÷ 2/6=1/2. 
The question is how much of the greater can you
measure off on the smaller; 3 cannot be measured off on 2, but
we can measure off 2/3 of the measuring line—1/3 ÷ 1/2 = 2/3.
The same principles apply to <emph rend="bold">decimal fractions.</emph> These are very
beautiful and very important, because we use them in finding
interest.</p>
          <p>It can easily be shown that it is not difficult to tell what
rate of interest is being received on any sum of money, and it is
now very important that we should teach interest in a
businesslike way, and remember that percentage is not interest.
First find the cost of what we bought, and to this sum add all
the after expenses, then see what rate per cent. this is on our
money.</p>
          <p>As a general thing, bookkeeping is left for the
higher classes, but it ought to be taught much lower
down, and it is for this reason that decimals, which
can be so easily used in the operation of finding interest, 
should be well taught. For instance: A house
is bought for $3000 and rents for $25 a month; what
rate of interest does the investment pay? Nothing was
said of taxes, nothing of the repairs and nothing of the
<pb id="coppin114" n="114"/>
time when the house was unrented, and yet this was
given as a problem for some one to find the rate of interest. A
good rule is to find what the money would have gained if it had
been on interest at one per cent. for the given time and divide
the given interest by it.</p>

          <head>XII.</head>
          <head>MY VISIT TO ENGLAND.</head>
          <p>IN THE year 1888, the Centenary of
Missions was held in London, and
all Foreign Missionary Societies
were invited to send delegates to
the meeting. I was at that time
President of the Women's Home
and Foreign Missionary Society of the A. M. E.
Church, and was elected a delegate to represent the
Society at that meeting. For the better understanding 
of the work, I went to New York and met the
different heads of the Societies in America. Among
these was Doctor Kincaid, a classmate of mine at
Oberlin College, and a representative minister in his
church.</p>
          <p>Doctor Kincaid reminded me of an incident which
happened at Oberlin, when he and I, among others, were
examined for the First Church choir. He asked if I remembered
how sorry I was when he failed in his examination. I certainly
had forgotten all about it.</p>
          <p>When the time came for me to go to England, I did not
look upon the visit with much favor. Never having been
abroad before, and not knowing a soul on the ship, I had many
doubts as to how I would get
<pb id="coppin116" n="116"/>
along. And so I had it out with the Lord. Thou seest, O Lord,
that I have no one to help me, and if I get nausea I may faint
and be very troublesome to those about me. Thou seest, O
Lord, that I must not get sick. And I wasn't sick.</p>
          <p>From time to time, when I had the least feeling of nausea, I
would walk up and down the deck of the vessel and sing.
Patriotic songs, Sunday school hymns, all came in for a share
of my singing devotion.</p>
          <p>It so happened that the French Minister to Madagascar
was aboard the ship; and as the notes of that noble melody,
the Marseillaise, rolled out upon the water, he expressed
himself as being delighted, and what Frenchman wouldn't. So, I
began to make friends. Not less, also, when the “Star Spangled
Banner” came up for a share. I knew that I could sing as much
as I pleased; nobody was disturbed, and the least inkling of
sickness entirely disappeared. I can recommend singing as one
of the best preventatives against seasickness.</p>
          <p>We arrived at Liverpool. Out in the Mersey the ship was
blowing and blowing. I asked what this was for, and was told
that it was a call for a tender. What is that? said I. Very soon I
saw a little steamer leaving the wharf and coming toward us,
bobbing up and down like a duck.</p>
          <p>Soon we were at the Custom House where the officers
were waiting to examine our “luggage,” as they call it there. It
didn't take long to get thru mine, but a dear old Irish friend
that I had made on
<pb id="coppin117" n="117"/>
the vessel got held up on some little bags of candy which she
was taking to her grandchildren. It's tobacco, said the officer.
It's candy, said my Irish friend. I felt that I could not remain
longer, for the cab was waiting to take us to the train. But my
friend came out with the verdict in favor of candy.</p>
          <p>Having arrived at the train, my friend said, I am going to
cable home. One word tells the story. What is your code? I had
no code. Did not understand what a convenience it was. One
word could have informed friends at home that I arrived safe
and in good condition. My Irish friend had often crossed the
water and had learned what to do. I should have decided upon
a code before I left home. As it was, they had to wait at home
until they could hear from me by letter.</p>
          <p>Off for London now, where Edwards' Family Hotel gave
me safe shelter until I could communicate with the committee.</p>
          <p>This having been attended to at Exeter Hall, I was
informed that Lady—had signified her intention to take some of
the delegates. I thought it no more than fair that she should be
informed that I was a colored woman. Ah shucks, said the
committee, we do not care anything about that.</p>
          <p>And so off I went to what turned out to be a most
agreeable stopping place.</p>
          <p>Next came the meeting with that assembly of gray-headed
men and women, who for many years
<pb id="coppin118" n="118"/>
had been living in far-away lands, carrying the Gospel into the
benighted places of the earth.</p>
          <p>What a glorious thing it was to hear their experiences.
Fairy stories could not be more entrancing.</p>
          <p>I knew that there was much to be seen in London, but I
could not be lured away from this religious assembly, so long
as the meetings continued.</p>
          <p>In a few days I was informed that Dr. William B. Derrick
had arrived from America and was eloquently giving his story
of the uplift among his people.</p>
          <p>The English people were deeply touched by the fact that,
tho hardly a decade out of slavery, the colored people had
organized for work in heathen lands.</p>
          <p>A Presbyterian minister, in speaking, told the women
repeatedly that they must not assume any ecclesiastical
functions. This got me riled, and in reply I tried to make it plain
that the Lord God alone gives the limit to the functions of
woman's religious work. I never had any desire to assume
ecclesiastical functions, and I always considered the pulpit a
sacred place, and therefore have always refused to make
speeches from it.</p>
          <p>In addressing the meeting, I spoke in part as follows,
(taken from the printed minutes): Sometimes when a thought
comes uppermost it is better to get it out of the way, as it may
be very troublesome afterwards. Now, with reference to what
we have heard this morning, I wish to say this. I think there is
nothing in the law of God's universe, that was made without
having ample space to move in, without trenching
<pb id="coppin119" n="119"/>
upon its neighbor's domain; and it may very well be said of
women, that while they are and were created second, they
were not only created with body, but they were created also
with a head, and they are responsible therefore to decide in
certain matters and to use their own judgment.</p>
          <p>It is also very true, as I will certainly say, that fools often
rush in where angels fear to tread; but then I question as to
whether all fools are confined to the feminine gender. Ladies
and gentlemen, time is very brief, indeed, and I am
overwhelmed with the thoughts of looking upon English
people and upon English faces, the historic land of liberty. No
one here can understand how the women occupying the 
great seaboard yonder, have looked upon
this land—those who, like myself, bear the yoke with them. Now,
there are in the United States, distributed among eleven of the
former Southern States, over eight million of my people. Of
these, more than 3,000,000 are women, and those three millions
whom the Lord God, in His inscrutable providence, has seen fit
to pass through a hard school, distributed, as I say, along there
and very nearly in the majority, they send greetings here today
and wish me to speak about what their feeling is towards the
Christianization of the colored races of the earth. You will not, I
am sure, deny us the very peculiar interest, as I say, in the
Christianization of all races. These poor women, less than a
decade out of slavery, established a Foreign Missionary
Society and have their foreign missionaries in the island of
<pb id="coppin120" n="120"/>
Hayti, in San Domingo, in Trinidad, in St. Thomas and Sierra
Leone, on the west coast of Africa. They have not a whole loaf
to share, as we all know; they have not even a half loaf to
share with their sisters and brothers in foreign lands. They
have but a crust; but, poor as they are, they sent me here—three
millions of those women sent me 3000 miles—to say to all who
are here assembled that their hearts are in that work, and that
they intend to devote not only what little they have of money
and resources to sustain their missionaries in those lands, but
they are prepared to give themselves.</p>
          <p>How I wanted yesterday to say, as Mr. Guinness spoke of
Africa, what wonderful transmutations under God's providence
have been taking place among these people, and what a
missionary spirit has been developed amongst them. The
problem how to reach the colored people on the Western
Coast has been for years one which civilized nations have
been unable to unravel, but He, in His own time, will make it
plain. Who hath known the mind of the Lord in those things?
And yet we have been hampered on all sides by presupposed
ideas of what was meant by the enslavement of all these
people. Now, let me say something about them. The spirit of
missionaries, the spirit of mission work, is the spirit of sharing
all we have. Those to whom God gives intelligence and wealth,
He gave it simply that it might be shared. Did He give you more
intelligence than another? Then He gave some one else less,
and it is your bounden duty to use it to help
<pb id="coppin121" n="121"/>
that one who has not so much as you. Did He make you rich?
Then He has made another poor, and the greatest of blessings,
and the truest happiness is to share all that you have with
those who need it. But if not from the grace and blessedness, I
do think from the very necessity of the fact that all history
teaches that those who have had more light from God, or more
of the good things of this life, and who have not shared it with
those about them, they have had every bit taken away from
them, as you very well know; and the light passed on, and on,
and on, thru the Eastern countries, westward until it beamed
equally on all men, as the Lord God intended that it should do.</p>

          <head> XIII.</head>
          <head>MY VISIT TO SOUTH AFRICA.</head>
          <p>TO GO to Africa, the original home of our people, see them in
their native life and habits, and to contribute, even in a
small degree, toward the development, civil and religious,
that is going on among them, is a privilege that anyone
might be glad to enjoy.</p>
          <p>After having spent thirty-seven years in the school room, 
laboring to give a correct start in life to the youth that came
under my influence, it was indeed, to me, a fortunate incident
to finish my active work right in Africa, the home of the
ancestors of those whose lives I had endeavored to direct.</p>
          <p>All this came about thru my marriage in 1881 to Rev. L. J.
Coppin who, in 1900, was elected one of the Bishops of the
African Methodist Episcopal Church, and assigned to South
Africa.</p>
          <p>It may not be of special interest to the reader to hear all
about the trip across the Atlantic to Liverpool on the
steamship Umbria, of the Cunard Line, nor of the voyage from
London, down the river Thames to Southampton, on the
steamship German, and thence down the coast via Teneriffe
Island.</p>
          <pb id="coppin123" n="123"/>
          <p>The objective point was Cape Town, South Africa, and
when on Sunday morning, November 30, 1902, we came to
anchor in Table Bay, a new world seemed to rise before me,
and a new vision.</p>
          <p>Our new residence was at Cape Town, where rooms had
been prepared on the second floor of a building, which
constituted our headquarters when not traveling over the
work.</p>
          <p>Cape Town is, in a sense, a modern city. It has been
occupied a long time by the English, and such sanitary
conditions obtain as might be expected of a city under English
rule.</p>
          <p>The historic Table Mountain affords a natural reservoir,
and supplies the town with drinking water of
a superior quality. The markets are not large, and much of the
food is imported, and the “high cost of living” is a familiar
topic. Being situated right on the Bay, fishing is one of the
daily vocations, and we have fish in abundance. But then,
even missionaries will tire of fish if they are the daily food, 
for surely man can no more live on fish alone than on bread alone.</p>
          <p>We were made as comfortable in our quarters as
missionaries have reason to expect, and the one absorbing
thought was, how shall we accomplish the work for which we
left our homes.</p>
          <p>In uniting with the A. M. E. Church after my marriage, I
asked my husband what particular work
I would be required or expected to do, and was told that a
certain portion of missionary work was given by the Church to
its women. Now, here was the field,
<pb id="coppin124" n="124"/>
for, with all the outward show of civilization at this English
seaport, the needs of the native and “coloured” people were
everywhere plain to be seen.</p>
          <p>The colored people are the mixed bloods, a condition that
obtains wherever a stronger people force their way into a
country and take possession.</p>
          <p>In many cases, the children of the dominant race were
cared for by being given, at least, a primary education, and
such employment as enabled them to have a fair proportion of
the necessities of life. But the much larger portion of “Cape
coloured” people were left to live their lives as best they might,
and rear their children in or out of wedlock.</p>
          <p>It was not an unusual sight to see my husband marry
couples and at the same time baptise both their children and
their grandchildren, and that within a very short distance of
Cape Town.</p>
          <p>The homes in which many of them lived in those nearby
places might well be called huts, and very poor ones at that.</p>
          <p>The Dutch farmers who gave them employment were
largely engaged in grape farming, and the manufacture of wine,
the poorest brands of which would be given to those miserable
dependents as part wages.</p>
          <p>In Cape Town itself, saloons were plentiful. Sometimes
one on every corner of street after street, and occasionally one
between.</p>
          <p>It surely cannot be difficult to imagine how easily a
people so neglected in the higher ideals of life would turn to
the drink habit as a mere pastime.</p>
          <pb id="coppin125" n="125"/>
          <p>The native people—those of unmixed African blood—who
came down from the country beyond, and found employment
principally as loaders and unloaders of ships, and the heavier
work along the railroads, would be quartered in “Locations” a
mile or two beyond the city limits. The cabins, or huts,
provided for them by the government at Cape Town, are very
inferior for comfort to those built by the natives in their rural
habitat before being brought into contact with our so-called
civilization. The Cape Town Location was on a tract of land
that would be fairly flooded with water during the rainy
season, and many who came down hale and hearty would
return consumptives—a disease practically unknown to the
 “heathen”—or never return at all.</p>
          <p>The drink habit would soon be learned by those raw
natives, and their last state would become worse than the first.</p>
          <p>We were often asked why we made our headquarters at
Cape Town instead of going and remaining far away into the
interior, doing work entirely among the uncivilized. But it was
hard indeed for us to turn away entirely from the conditons that
met us upon the very entrance into the country. It is true the
bulk of our work was far away from Cape Town, and among
people in primitive life; but it was a good thing to have a base
at this seaport town, where occasionally we could ourselves
return to modern life, and where we could also work among
those who needed us quite as much as those who had not
been introduced into the
<pb id="coppin126" n="126"/>
blessedness (?) of a civilization that places the acquisition of
wealth far above the redemption of souls.</p>
          <p>Well, here my “special” work began. My husband, who
preceded me on the field, had purchased a building and turned
it into a school and mission house— Bethel Institute—and here I
called the women together, the women who had risen above
their environments, really noble, faithful, Christian women, and
began my temperance work.</p>
          <p>We organized after the model of our work at home. A
local society was started, not only at Cape Town, but at many
nearby places where we had mission stations, and, drawing
from their membership, a Conference Branch was organized for
the Cape Colony Conference.</p>
          <p>At our first Annual Session of the Conference, which met
at Port Elizabeth, the sight of native and colored women in a
missionary session was one of the features of the Conference;
and a glorious and inspiring sight it was. Gathered about me on
the platform, and around the altar, were women who never before 
had appeared in public for Christian work, at least, never before to
take a leading part in it. They had been lately organized, and
now they were called upon to do the work of officers, and to
speak to the public gathering for themselves; some in Dutch—
their mother tongue—some in broken English, and some in their
own God-given native language.</p>
          <p>In my travels over the work with my husband I went as
far as Bulawayo, 1360 miles from Cape
<pb id="coppin127" n="127"/>
Town. The journey was long, tiresome and trying. At the
meeting held there in our mission house, I had a new and not
pleasant experience, for, after endeavoring to forget the fatigue
caused by the journey, I made my accustomed address by the
aid of an interpreter, and was seized with a fainting spell. I had
for years been accustomed to hard work, and often
deprivations, but had never before fallen at my post.</p>
          <p>I was tenderly carried by the loving hands of native
women out into the open, while Mr. Coppin went on with the
meeting.</p>
          <p>The small child of one of the native women was much
disturbed when the mother left it in the care of others while she
waited on me. The little one was not yet old enough to take in
the situation, and so, openly revolted against such neglect,
caused by a stranger who had been speaking in an unknown
tongue.</p>
          <p>At this particular meeting we afterwards learned that the
government had spies on hand, native spies, to observe all
that was said, and report to the authorities. The fear seemed to
be that the instruction likely to be given to the natives would
cause them to become dissatisfied with their lot, and, as some
said, “bring on a native problem, as they had had a Boer
problem.” The spirit of suspicion was everywhere prevalent,
and did much, for a time, to retard our work. I think, however,
the authorities finally came to understand that we were
missionaries pure and simple, and not politicians, and if there
was any cause for alarm it must
<pb id="coppin128" n="128"/>
grow out of the fact that enlightenment does indeed enable
people to see their true condition, and that they do sometimes
become dissatisfied when convinced that injustice, and a
general lack of the Christian spirit of brotherhood, is
responsible for much of their misery.</p>
          <p>The route to Bulawayo is upon the road constructed by
that great empire builder, John Cecil Rhodes, with the view of
carrying out his scheme, “from Cape to Cairo.” It goes thru a
large portion of country that is governed entirely by native
chiefs, with, of course, the English oversight that is now given
to all of South Africa, for there is no portion of the country that
is absolutely in the hands of native rulers, such as obtained
previous to the coming of the white man. But, in those native
colonies like Basutoland, for instance, the land is occupied by
the people of a given tribe, or “nation,” as they like to call
themselves, with a chief—paramount chief—in authority. The
chief is the ruler and judge in all matters, not including capital
punishment, or the leasing of lands to foreigners. They live
their shepherd life and pay but little attention to agriculture.
Having learned the value of money as an exchange, they go to
the mining camps and work for periods of time, six months, a
year, or even more, according to contract; take their money,
return home, buy cattle, and, if they wish, add more wives to
their household.</p>
          <p>Many of them have never been away from their desert
homes, and when the trains pass periodically thru their
country, they come out to the Halts, where
<pb id="coppin129" n="129"/>
water is taken on and telegraphic connections made. Those
Halts, or stations, are in the care of English officials. Perhaps a
man, his wife and their children are the only occupants of that
home, away out into the desert, far removed from civilization,
in the midst of native people, called heathen, who are counted
by multiplied thousands, but they have no fear and suffer no
harm.</p>
          <p>These innocent children of the forest come out to meet
the trains. They come in great numbers and in native garb,
which cannot be called clothing, but merely a sheep skin, or
strings of beads about their loins. They seem amazed as they
gaze at the trains, filled with people so unlike themselves in
appearance. They chatter away among themselves. Just what
they are thinking and saying, their distinguished guests have
no means of knowing.</p>
          <p>But when we, as missionaries, turn aside and go among
them with our interpreters, we have an opportunity to come in
possession of their thoughts and find out what manner of
people they are.</p>
          <p>That which always seems to be the prevailing desire
among them is to acquire a knowledge of the new conditions
which they see, but cannot understand.</p>
          <p>They soon learn what is meant by school, and
immediately express a desire to have their children taught. In
my experience among them, I have never found them entirely
satisfied with mere abstract teaching of religion. They have
religious views before we reach them. Crude, of course;
unenlightened, uncertain,
<pb id="coppin130" n="130"/>
speculative, false, just as all people hold who have not
been given the true word of God. When those who come to
them win their confidence, they readily modify their religious
views, regarding their teachers as their superiors in matters
religious. But there is nothing like a superstitious worshipping
of their benefactors, nor of the new doctrines which they
bring. With an incredible clearness of vision, they look
forward to and expect some practical and really tangible
benefits to grow out of their new relation.</p>
          <p>They already have, as it were, an intuitive sense of right
and wrong, hence they do no harm to the stranger in their
midst. Indeed, our religious teaching is, in a sense, but an
explanation of their own religious impulses.</p>
          <p>In their own moral and religious ethics they teach thou
shalt, and thou shalt not, without being able to give
philosophical reasons for it. Now when light is thrown into
their benighted minds, and reasons are given for certain ways
of life required of them, and their own creeds revised, taken
from and added to, imagine their surprise when they see their
teachers, disregarding in their lives, their own teaching. With
child-like credulity they turn from the old to the new, and when
disappointed in those who bring them the light they are not
prepared at first to conclude, by a process of reasoning, that
there is chaff among the wheat, dross with the gold, but,
rather, they feel that they have been deceived, and this
accounts for some of the lapses of which we hear so much.</p>
          <pb id="coppin131" n="131"/>
          <p>Our interpreters are native men who have come in contact
with civilization by being trained at mission schools. Some of
them have been to England and America and studied. But
many of them have never been out of Africa, and yet they
speak fluently English, Dutch and several of the tribal
languages, and read the Bible in those languages. We are
dependent upon the interpreter, and greatly indebted to the
forerunners in the mission fields who made such indispensible
aid possible.</p>
          <p>On our way from Bulawayo we stopped at Mafeking and
spent some time. There was a public reception given to us at
the Masonic temple. Mafeking became famous during the
Anglo-Boer war on account of the siege, and the gallant
defense by General Baden-Powell.</p>
          <p>John Cecil Rhodes was there during the siege, and when
they brought him butter he refused to eat it, and sent it to the
sick soldiers. Some of our societies were called the Cecil
Rhodes Bands of Mercy.</p>
          <p>Living at Mafeking are a large number of Malay people
who are Mohammedans. The leading spirit among them is a
merchant, Hadje Ben Hassen. Ben Hassen is his name, and he
is a Hadje by virtue of having made a pilgrimage to Mecca. One
of the moving spirits in the reception which was tendered was
this Hadje. He headed a delegation of his countrymen and
fellow religionists to the hall, and himself occupied a seat on
the platform among the speakers. In his address he said that it
was not customary for
<pb id="coppin132" n="132"/>
Christians and Mohammedans to thus come together, but, as
there was a Negro Bishop in their midst, he felt that the
religious idea should be set aside, and that all should come out
to do honor to a distinguished member of the race.</p>
          <p>Some of the Mohammedan people sent their children to
our school at Cape Town, and even provided them with Bibles
that they might take part in the opening services of the school.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one of the things that has caused Mohammedans
to step over the religious barriers that have kept the dark races
apart in Africa, is the fact that, when the lines of proscription
are drawn—and this is becoming more and more so—
the Malay, the Indian—East Indian—the native and the “coloured” are all
treated alike in matters social. Some of the Malays and Indians
are very wealthy, and the renewal of license has been refused
to some of the Indian merchants because it was said that
English merchants could not compete with them. This
happened at Port Elizabeth during the time that we were there
in conference sessions.</p>
          <p>Much wisdom and patience will be required on the part of
our ministers and teachers lest they should add to the spirit of
unrest that comes of injustice and proscription. Wisdom
dictates that by all means a conflict between the races should
be avoided. The Europeans, armed and drilled, would have the
advantage of all others, and there could be but one result. The
Kingdom of God does not proceed in its conquests by
<pb id="coppin133" n="133"/>
the employment of carnal weapons, and right can afford 
to be patient because it is bound to win in the end. </p>
          <p>The native people have had enough of war. Their vocation in
the ages past was to war among themselves, and it would
not be difficult to impress them that that is not the way to
right their wrongs. But the new life which we offer them is
the life of peace and good will, and they cannot believe in
God and our holy religion without believing that He is
able to carry out His purposes, tho He be long-suffering.</p>
          <p>My stay in Africa was pleasant, for I did not count the
deprivations, and sometimes hardships. We were graciously
kept from disease, even the bubonic plague that came to our
very door. I was permitted to go
with my husband thru the greater portion of his work, and
mingle with and talk to the women upon the subjects 
of righteousness, temperance and the judgment to come.
If some seed was sown that took root, and will never be
entirely uprooted, the visit to Africa was
not in vain. In selecting names for our local auxiliary societies,
we chose the names of some of the women at home who
labored during their lifetime in home missions, besides helping
the foreign work. And so we have the Mary A. Campbell
Society at one place, the Florida Grant at another, and other
names of worthy ones which will be handed down to posterity,
and be a means of inspiring those who will be told of their
work and worth.</p>

          <head>INTRODUCTION TO PART SECOND</head>
          <p>IT WAS Carlyle who said “the human anecdotal is the best of all
writing,” and this part of the posthumous effort of Fanny
M. Jackson-Coppin will have a measure of interest, along
with the direct personal output from the pen of one of the
brainiest, best and most useful women of Negro origin. For
many years the writer urged with others some tangibility
from her pen, and it was only after an enforced home
keeping, through sickness, that it was at last undertaken.
She “crossed the bar” in January and the autumn prior
found the book practically finished. In several talks,
including one, just five days previous to her final
leavetaking, she was full of regret that the data
accumulated by her had not taken the finished form of the
first part. It was at hand, however, but not codified and
arranged in sequence. The spirit of altruism, the self-abnegations 
of a lifetime, were obvious in her motive in the
other part she had planned. She meant that those who had
helped her, and that some of the exceptional scholars 
from the school in which she had taught for nearly forty years, 
should be a part of her last effort. All the details, 
and all the persons noted in the pages to follow, 
were her thought, suggestion, and arrangement. She is recalled
<pb id="coppin138" n="138"/>
by the writer from the time of her advent in Philadelphia, and all
the way thru he has followed her career not only with profit and
interest, but with admiration. He knows of the many needy,
ambitious and purposeful boys and girls she helped, not only
by suggestions, but practically. He is aware of the initial steps
to combine both head and hand training, and how as far back
as the Centennial days, which seemed to be the fulcrum for her
lever, she started the project, that was seen in the trades that
were taught along with academics. The managers had a
practical demonstration of her belief in the way she secured
several thousand dollars as an earnest of it. This was even
before 1880, antedating Tuskegee, and a few years later the
Managers were convinced, and the school set in motion with
the money in hand. Two efforts of a tentative character, with
the head and hand combination, were made with insufficient
funds in the '30's, at Eddington and Chester County. There was
then a halt, and the school was not started again until the '40's,
and carried on for a brief span by Ishmael Locke. There was
another closing of the school, but money came by bequest and
gift, and the idea of mind training alone was set in motion, and
continued under Professors Reason and Bassett and Mrs.
Coppin herself, until the change came as narrated.</p>
          <p>This is simply a supplementary pointer to an aftermath of
splendid effort, as seen in the first part; and in no sense an
introduction—for who is there to introduce a woman like Fanny
M. Jackson-Coppin?</p>

TEACHERS, GRADUATES AND<lb/>
UNDER-GRADUATES</head>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Charles L. Reason.</emph>—Ishmael Locke was the first teacher
for the Institute for Colored Youth, and his tenure was brief, for
the reason of insufficient funds. When this was secured, the
managers put up the building at 716-18 Lombard street, and
secured Prof. Charles L. Reason as its head. Prof. Reason was a
native of New York city, and a graduate of the McGrawville
College, N. Y. In 1849 he was called to the chair of Belles
Lettres and Mathematics, in New York Central College, and
relinquished his work there to come to Philadelphia. He
remained but two years, when he went to his native city and
became principal of the largest public school there. He was a
man of rare personality and finely equipped for teaching. He
was cultured beyond most of his contemporaries, and wrote
strongly and gracefully both verse and prose. In all the anti-slavery 
publications he was a contributor, as well as to the
Anglo-African Magazine, begun in New York in 1859 under
men like Dr. James McCune Smith. He lived to a ripe age, and
not only in the educational field was he a potency, but in all the
concerns of a public character in which his race was a
<pb id="coppin140" n="140"/>
part. A singular coincidence was the fact of a call to Grace M.
Mapps, of this city, as the head of the Girls' Department, I. C.
Y., at the time of Professor Reason's call. She was a graduate
of McGrawville College, and the pioneer colored woman as a
college graduate.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Hon. Ebenezer D. Bassett</emph> was the principal in charge of
the Institute for Colored Youth who immediately preceded
Mrs. Fanny Jackson-Coppin.</p>
          <p>Mr. Bassett was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, attended
the Birmingham Academy, now known as the Derby High
School, and was graduated from the Connecticut State Normal
School at New Britain in 1853. He also studied at Yale in '54 and
'55. It was in the fall of '55 that he accepted the position as
principal of the Institute for Colored Youth. He remained here
for fourteen years. He was an earnest, forceful teacher, always
painstaking, always faithful to his duties, and was especially
successful in the teaching of mathematics and the classics, in
which he had excelled while a student at Yale.</p>
          <p>In 1869 he was appointed first United States Minister to
Haiti by President Grant, and served in this capacity until 1879.</p>
          <p>Our government's appreciation of his services is shown in
the acceptance of his manual on the “Resources and
Government of Haiti” as authoritative by the Bureau of
American Republics, at Washington.</p>
          <p>During one of his visits to his home at New Haven
<figure id="ill3" entity="coppi140"><p>PROF. C. L. REASON HON. E. D. BASSETT<lb/>PROF. ROBT. CAMPBELL MARTHA F. MINTON PROF. OCTAVIUS V. CATTO <lb/>PROF. JACOB C. WHITE, JR. R. E. DER. VENNING</p></figure>
<pb id="coppin141" n="141"/>
he was invited and delivered an address upon “The Right of
Asylum,” before the Law School at Yale.</p>
          <p>On his return to the States the Haitien Government
appointed him Consul General at New York city. This position
he held for twelve years. Again in 1898, at the outbreak of the
Spanish War, the people of Haiti, fearing that they might be
included in the annexation which was then under discussion,
desired the advantage of Mr. Bassett's experience and advice.
He was then reappointed as Vice Consul. This position he held
until his death, November 13, 1908.</p>
          <p>It was during Mr. Bassett's administration as principal of
the Institute that the first examination and appointment of
colored teachers obtained in our public schools.</p>
          <p><emph rend="bold">Octavius V. Catto</emph> was born in Charleston, S. C., February
22, 1840, but came to Philadelphia with his parents at an early
age.</p>
          <p>He attended the Institute for Colored Youth and
graduated therefrom as the valedictorian of his class in 1858.
He was immediately appointed assistant to the Principal, the
late Hon. E. D. Bassett, as teacher of English and Mathematics.</p>
          <p>In the early “sixties” he was called to the principalship of
a Grammar School in Brooklyn, but, declining this offer, he
remained assistant to Mr. Bassett until 1869, when the latter
was appointed Minister to Haiti by President Grant. Mr. Catto
then became Principal of the Boys' High School Department of
the Institute.</p>
          <pb id="coppin142" n="142"/>
          <p>The following year he was granted a month's leave of
absence by the Board of Managers so that he might go to
Washington, D. C., at the request of the school authorities
there, to revise the course of instruction for the public schools
of that city. This was done because he had declined the
appointment of Superintendent of Colored Schools which they
had tendered him, as the Managers of the Institute were
equally desirous of retaining him here in Philadelphia.</p>
          <p>He was one of the famous ninety colored men who
answered the first call for troops in the North in the late Civil
War, and who were turned away from the Capitol at Harrisburg
by Governor Curtin, who declared no colored soldiers should
cross the State of Pennsylvania while he was Governor.</p>
          <p>He drafted the Bill of Rights for equal accommodation for
all in the cars of our city, and was also one of the committee
who repeatedly visited Harrisburg, accompanied by the late
Prof. Jacob C. White, Jr., who for many years was Principal of
the Roberts Vaux School, of the Fourteenth Section. Thru the
persistent efforts of Mr. Catto and his committee the passage
of the bill was secured, and it remains intact to-day.</p>
          <p>Mr. Catto was one of the founders of the Banneker
Institute, a literary association of considerable merit, which
was in existence over twenty years. He was also an active,
member of the Philadelphia Library
<pb id="coppin143" n="143"/>
Company, which had been organized in 1832 and was not
disbanded until after his death.</p>
          <p>He was a speaker of pleasing voice, gracious yet forceful
manner and persuasive power. He was an upright, intelligent
citizen, who took active part in all intellectual affairs of the
hour.</p>
          <p>His strong belief in the power of education in the
development of a people is well shown in the following
quotation from one of his addresses: “It is the duty of every
man, to the extent of his interest and means, to provide for the
immediate improvement of the four or five millions of ignorant
and previously dependent laborers who will be thrown upon
society in the reorganization of the Union. It is for the good of
the nation that every element of its population be wisely
instructed in the advantages of a republican government, that
every element of its people, mingled tho they be, shall have a
true and intelligent conception of the allegiance due to the
established powers.”</p>
          <p>He was cruelly assassinated by a political enemy, on
October 10, 1871, while returning to his home from school.</p>
          <p>The city authorities accorded him as great honor as was
ever given to any citizen, the city officials attending the
funeral, which expenses were borne by the city government.</p>
          <p>A just condemnation of the deed which caused his
untimely end, no less than a just appreciation of his many
manly and noble traits, led the Board of
<pb id="coppin144" n="144"/>
School Directors of the Seventh Section, with the late Thomas
Durham as President, to request the Board of Education to
name the Public School on Lombard street, west of Twentieth
street, in his honor, at its dedication in January, 1879.</p>

the late Fanny Jackson Coppin to take advantage of the
opportunities offered for skilled hand training in the Industrial
Department of the I. C. Y. were <emph rend="bold">Ida A. Burrell</emph> and <emph rend="bold">Helen M.

George Louis Smiley, has the honor of being one of the
youngest graduates of the Institute (having graduated at the
precocious age of 15 years).</p>
          <p>Immediately after graduation he became a clerk in one of
the largest wholesale drug houses in this country, where he is
still employed, having risen to a responsible position in the
finance department of that concern.</p>
          <p>Early in life Mr. Smiley became convinced of the
expediency of versatility, hence did not confine his talents to
one field, but delved into the art of photography; particularly
excelling in the photography of horses and dogs. While yet a
boy, he was invited to exhibit his photographs at the National
Export Exposition. His exhibit there attracted marked attention
and flattering comment. His pictures—entitled “The First
Milking Lesson,” and “The Little Pool” (illustrating one of
Dunbar's poems)—at the close of the exposition were
purchased by one of the leading magazines.</p>
          <p>While on the subject of photography it would be well to
note that the major part of the illustrations in this volume were
made by this young man when he was 13 years old.</p>
          <p>Another evidence of the versatility of this young man is
found in his excellent elocutionary powers,
<pb id="coppin170" n="170"/>
which he has devoted to the rendition of Dunbar's poems,
giving private recitals in the homes of some of the most
exclusive millionaires. His rendition of Dunbar is “delightfully
different”— Dunbar himself having said in the presence of the
writer: “Young Smiley gets more of the subtle meaning out of
my works than any other person I've heard. He has the rarest
dialect and a fund of natural humor; never burlesques the race
or resorts to facial grimaces, but makes you laugh with the
race, not at them.”</p>
          <p>In addition to these widely different accomplishments,
Mr. Smiley has achieved marked success as a writer of dialect
stories; in fact his name might now be a household word, did
he not modestly hide his identity under a “nom de plume.”</p>

was recognized by an appointment as one of the assistant
surgeons at his Alma Mater, where he served as such for ten
years. In the examination before the Pennsylvania State Board
he obtained an average of ninety-seven and three-tenths, the
highest known. From the beginning of the Mercy Hospital he
has been on its staff. His practice is one of the largest and most
lucrative in this city. He comes of a lineage that has been of
great value to Philadelphia, one of his forbears being Absalom
Jones, founder of the Protestant Episcopal Church among
colored people in the United States, in 1792, as well as Clayton
Durham, a co-worker with Richard Allen, in the organization of
the A. M. E. Church Conference, in 1816.</p>

in the Girls' High and Normal School in Philadelphia, was
appointed in the beginning to take charge of that work also in
the Industrial Department of the I. C. Y. The teaching of so
many classes was a great tax upon the strength of Mrs. Maffett, 
and she determined to give up some of them. She noticed
that there was one pupil, who with some additional training,
might be appointed as her successor. One of the requirements
of the course was the drafting and making of a pattern at
home. One day when the
<pb id="coppin174" n="174"/>
class was called upon to present patterns, one pupil found that
her pattern was missing. She immediately asked the teacher to
grant her a few minutes in which to make another, which she
did, and won for herself the highest commendation.</p>
          <p>This was the pupil that Mrs. Moffitt determined should be
her successor. Mrs. Moffitt had the pupil apply herself at the
school and after hours gave her further instructions in her own
home to get the required course in less time.</p>
          <p>After due consideration this pupil, <emph rend="bold">Ida A. Burrell,</emph> was
asked to assist Mrs. Moffit for a term of six months to
demonstrate her ability to teach the work. At the expiration of
this term of probation she was appointed to take charge of
these classes, which she held until the close of the work of this
school in Philadelphia. During this period of time she was
called on to take charge of classes in sewing at the Hutchinson
Street School for Colored Children and the classes formed
during the existence of the Colored Women's Exchange and
Dormitory for Girls, 754 South Twelfth St., managed and
supervised by Mrs. F. J. Coppin.</p>
          <p>Seeing the necessity for advancement, Miss Burrell took
advanced work in New York City at S. T. Taylor's
Establishment in Cutting and Designing. Special work at Drexel
Institute in dressmaking. Knowing that the demand was for
teachers in Manual Training who knew all branches of the
work, Miss Burrell entered and completed the normal course in
the Philadelphia Cooking School, and in September,
<pb id="coppin175" n="175"/>
1906, received an appointment in Lincoln Institute, Jefferson
City, Mo., to teach Domestic Science. She remained here one
year, leaving to accept a position in the same work in the

attracted the attention of the teacher of Domestic Science (in

for Colored Youth, Philadelphia, Pa.), Miss Imogene C. Belden.
It was thru the influence of Miss Belden that the work of Miss
H. Burrell was brought to the attention of Mrs. Sarah Tyson
Rorer, principal of the Philadelphia Cooking School. When the
course was completed, and during the annual exhibition of
the work of the pupils of the I. C. Y., Mrs. Rorer visited the
school, interviewed Mrs. Coppin concerning this pupil's work
and personally invited Helen Burrell to take the normal course
to prepare herself to teach the work. Being without funds to defray her
expenses, Mrs. Rorer again came to the rescue and made it possible 
for her to work her way thru the school term by doing extra work
before and after school hours.</p>
          <p>When the Colored Women's Exchange and Dormitory 
for Girls was opened, on South Twelfth street, this
young woman prepared and offered for sale preserved fruits,
homemade candies, prepared by her own hands. It was thru
the encouragement of Mrs.

Coppin that she was enabled to earn her first money in the
practical work of preparing, cooking and serving a course
dinner in honor of the birthday of one of the A. M. E. Bishops.
Teaching seemed to be the profession that Miss Burrell was
best fitted for, as she was successful in her season of teaching
in the country schools of Maryland. She was called to take
charge of the Domestic Science classes for colored girls when
the Board of Education of the city of St. Louis decided to add
manual training as part of the curriculum in that city. Here she
taught successfully for over ten years, resigning her position
to become the wife of Mr. Henry A. Smith, of the firm of Clark

Colored Youth, where he took the full course, graduating in
1873. He taught in Chester for awhile, and then became a part
of the teaching staff of his alma mater, which only ended with
his death. His work as teacher was indeed efficient, and it was
a rule with him never to let a pupil go until he had grasped his
lesson. He was not only faithful to his duties, but exceptionally
conscientious. He never watched the clock, and only
considered his school work ended when every task was
finished. He took up expert accounting and bookkeeping, and
received a diploma from one of our best business colleges. He
was among the first students to matriculate at the
Pennsylvania Academy of Industrial Arts, from which he
graduated with honors. This equipment added to his duties at
the Institute, and pretty soon the art course there became a

industrial department, our subject assisted her. Not only in the
detail work of its formation, but in all its movements afterwards.
He was a man of engaging personality, and his whole career as

H. Matthews.</emph> Two were graduates of the Institute, of the
classes of '63 and '64, and the other, an undergraduate of the
class of '63.</p>
          <p>This school was known as the Ohio Street Unclassified
School.</p>
          <p>In 1867 Miss Jennings was called to Louisville to take
charge of a high school in that city. Another
<figure id="ill14" entity="coppi180"><p>CLASS IN COOKING<lb/>LIBRARY</p></figure>
<pb id="coppin181" n="181"/>
examination was held in January of this year to the
vacancy caused by Miss Jennings' resignation. As
a result of this examination Miss Le Count was chosen
principal.</p>
          <p>A few years later, in 1878, the board decided
to erect the building on Lombard street, west of Twentieth—
the Octavius V. <sic corr="Catto">Cato</sic> School.</p>
          <p>Since that time, until the closing of the building in
December, 1910, the Institute furnished the greater number of
the teachers, notably <emph rend="bold">Lucretia C. Miller, Elizabeth Ramsey Still,
Annie E. Marriett, John Durham, John H. Clifton, Melinda J. Amos, 
Maria G. Jones, Dora Cole Lewis, Charlotte Bassett, M. Inez Cassey.</emph></p>
          <p>Let it here be recorded to the credit of the Institute and
teachers that at neither of these two examinations 
did any graduate or undergraduate fail to receive a
certificate. Nor should this fact be omitted
that <emph rend="bold">Mrs. Mary F. Randolph,</emph> nee <emph rend="bold">Durham,</emph> former pupil of the O.
V. Catto School, undergraduate of Institute and graduate of the
Girls' High and Normal School; <emph rend="bold">Miss Annie E. Marriett</emph> and
<emph rend="bold">Miss Henrietta R. Farrelly,</emph> graduates of the Institute, are the
first to obtain certificates entitling them to hold positions as
supervisors of the elementary schools.</p>
          <p>In January, 1911, the Octavius V. Catto School was
merged with two other schools of the district in the building
located at Sixteenth and Lombard streets, as the Thomas
Durham School. At this time Miss Miller and Miss Le Count
retired from the profession.</p>
