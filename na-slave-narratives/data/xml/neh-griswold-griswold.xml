        <head>NARRATIVE.</head>
        <p>THE YOUNG AFRICAN, whose arrival in this
city in company with the Rev. Dr. Savage, was
noticed in the Witness and Advocate of the 20th
October, 1843, is now numbered with the dead.
His father is king of the Barbo tribe, and he and
his people are still living in the lowest depths of
heathenism.</p>
        <p>“Wana Hobah” (his native name) was taken
into the Mission school of the American Protestant
Episcopal Church, at Cape Palmas in 1836,
being then about ten years of age, and but little
elevated in intellectual condition above the beasts
of the forest.</p>
        <p>He was the fifth of the fifteen native youths
<pb id="griswold4" n="4"/>
who, for several years past, have been supported
at the mission stations in Africa by the scholars
and teachers of Grace Church Sunday school in
this city, and by their request he was named A.
V. Griswold.</p>
        <p>His improvement at the Mission school was
very satisfactory, particularly in view of the fact,
that a foreign language was to be acquired before
he could advance a step in other studies. We
found him, after only a few years' instruction
by our missionaries in Africa, well versed in the
scriptures, and the doctrines and services of our
Church, in grammar, geography, arithmetic, and
writing, and no stranger to the study of philosophy
and astronomy.</p>
        <p>The following extract from the notice referred
to, will show the impression produced on those
who saw him soon after his arrival in Boston, in
October, 1843:</p>
        <p>“He reads fluently and without embarrassment,
and whoever had the privilege and pleasure of
witnessing his interesting examination, which
<pb id="griswold5" n="5"/>
took place in Grace Church Sunday school, on
Sunday morning, could not but thank God for
such an evidence of the blessed nature of the
missionary work, and of the faithfulness of our
missionaries in Africa. Especially must they
have been gratified with his ready and appropriate
answers to the questions put to him by the Rev.
Mr. C., in reference to the leading doctrines of
the Christian religion.”</p>
        <p>The object which Dr. Savage had in view in
bringing him to America was, that he might
learn the art of printing, then return to his native
land and take his station at the missionary press.</p>
        <p>During his residence in this city, he was
in the family of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, who had
Griswold under their care when in Africa, two
or three years since; and was also a regular
attendant at the Sunday school of Grace Church.
He was kindly taken into the printing-office of
T. R. Marvin, Esq., and every person connected
with the establishment, manifested a deep and
lively interest in his welfare. The following
<pb id="griswold6" n="6"/>
extract of a letter written by Griswold to his
father, dated October 31st, is interesting evidence
of the state of his mind, after his first month's
residence in this city:</p>
        <p>“I have very good friends here, I am living
with Mr. Perkins. I am now learning to print,
so as to come home and print books for our
countrymen. I have seen the mighty works of
the Lord. I have seen water hard as stone, and
burns like fire. Witch never touch me. I am
well. The Lord is with me, so you and all the
old men ought to throw away your gregrees and
serve God, because He only is able to save your
souls from eternal punishment of hell.</p>
        <p>“The leaves of the trees are falling off now,
and as these leaves are falling, so we all shall
fall. O what a greater punishment it must be to
them that hear the word of God and do not do it;
if we do not love God for all the things He has
done for us, and above all, for sending His only
begotten Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us.”</p>
        <p>After his death, the following was found
<pb id="griswold7" n="7"/>
among his few books and papers, being the hasty
draft of a letter written by him during the visit of
Dr. Savage here in April, 1844, and addressed to
a young friend in the Mission school at Cape
Palmas:</p>
        <p>“Dear Friend: I am very glad to hear that
you are all well. So we all are here. But how
is my poor old father and mother and all my
friends?</p>
        <p>“I would advise you, my dear young friends
of the Mission schools, to keep up as great a
strife and earnestness in religion, as if you knew
yourselves to be in a state of nature, and were
seeking conversion.</p>
        <p>“Persons are advised, under conviction, to be
earnest and violent for the kingdom of heaven,
but when they have attained to conversion, they
ought not to be the less watchful, laborious and
earnest in the whole work of religion, but the
more so, for they are under infinite greater
obligations.</p>
        <p>“For want of this, many persons, in few months
<pb id="griswold8" n="8"/>
after their conversion, have begun to lose their
sweet and lively sense of spiritual things, and to
grow dark, and have ‘pierced themselves through
with many sorrows.’ Whereas, if you do as the
apostle did, your path shall be ‘as the shining
light, which shineth more and more unto the
perfect day.’ ”</p>
        <p>A manuscript was also found among his papers,
which gave good evidence of his familiar
acquaintance with, and regard for, the Book of
Common Prayer. Several pages were written
in the Barbo language, comprising the opening
sentences, Exhortation, Lord's Prayer, &amp;c.</p>
        <p>Being intelligent and quick to learn, his
improvement was rapid, and he bid fair soon to
accomplish the object for which he came to this
country. But the wise and overruling providence
of God has ordered otherwise. After having
passed through one of our severest winters with
almost entire exemption from disease, during
which he was seldom absent from his accustomed
employment, and when all danger from the
<pb id="griswold9" n="9"/>
severity of our climate seemed to be over, he
was attacked, on Sunday, May 5th, 1844, with
inflammation of the lungs. Although the disease
was developed with considerable severity, still his
case was not considered hopeless until within a
few hours of his death, which happened on the
twelfth day. About noon, on Thursday, the
16th, a change took place for the worse, and
notwithstanding the most energetic treatment,
he continued to sink until a little before midnight,
when he quietly breathed his last. The writer
of this cannot but bear testimony to the untiring
efforts of Dr. H. to alleviate the sufferings of the
deceased, and to the unceasing and patient labors
of Mr. and Mrs. Perkins, who watched over him
by day and by night.</p>
        <p>In reviewing Griswold's course of life during
his seven or eight months' residence among us,
it is pleasant to be able to state that his Bible was
his most constant companion. Always on returning
from his daily avocation at evening, he
was in the habit of seating himself at the table
<pb id="griswold10" n="10"/>
with his Bible and dictionary before him. He
would read carefully; look out the definition of
difficult words; and when not able to understand
in this way, make inquiry of others. He was
regular in his private devotions, and frequently
when Mr. Perkins had occasion to go into his
chamber, he has found him on his knees, praying
to his Father in secret.</p>
        <p>His acquaintance with the Old and New
Testaments was often brought out in the Sunday
school. When questions of a general nature
were asked, and there was any hesitation or
delay in answering, an appeal to Griswold was
seldom made in vain. His prompt and pertinent
manner of replying will not soon be forgotten.
During his sickness, and when the trying hour
of death drew near, he seemed to find great
comfort and consolation in prayer, and in the
promises of God's word which he had so
constantly and diligently studied.</p>
        <p>On the third day of his sickness, he said to Mr.
Perkins, “I shall die.” On being asked whether
<pb id="griswold11" n="11"/>
he was willing to die, he replied, “Yes, if it is
God's will.” Mr. Perkins inquired what made
him willing to die, and whether he had not been
a great sinner. His answer was, “I hope God
has wiped all my sins out of His book for Jesus'
sake.” He was asked what he had done to
cause God thus to favor him. He said, “I have
prayed to Him to forgive me, and Jesus has died
for me.” Inquiry was then made, if it were left
to him to recover or die, what he would do. To
which he replied, “Just as God wishes.” At
another time he said, “I do not ask to live; I do
not ask to die. If God is willing I should go
back to Africa and print the Bible for my 
country-people, I should like to go. If not, I am willing
to die.” Mr. Perkins said to him: perhaps God
may see that if He permits you to go back to
Africa, you may bring dishonor on His name by
returning to heathenism. He raised his eyes
towards heaven, and said, with striking emphasis,
“God forbid.” Inquiry was made, whether he
wished to say any thing to Dr. Savage. He
<pb id="griswold12" n="12"/>
answered, “Ask Dr. Savage to forgive me all
the bad things I have done, and to pray for me. Ask
him to ask the boys to pray for me, that I may
go back to Africa as a printer, and print the
Bible.” He was told if he was sick in his own
country, his old father would say he was witched,
and if he should now die, he will say witch has
killed him. He was then asked what message
he would send to his father about it. He said,
“Tell my father, witch is all foolishness; God
gave me to you and God has taken me away
from you. You must bless the Lord for this.”
When asked if he would like to have prayers
offered for him in Church, he answered quickly,
“Yes,” and after a short pause, he added, “Yes,
yes, very much indeed.”</p>
        <p>The night before he died, Griswold's Sunday
school teacher watched with him. The most of
the time he was restless and uneasy; but
occasionally he was composed, and then was
engaged either in trying to sing some favorite
hymns or in prayer. At one time in particular,
<pb id="griswold13" n="13"/>
about midnight, he commenced an audible
prayer, in which be asked God's blessing on his
poor father and mother, the missionaries, and
the Sunday school, and on his own soul. He
frequently, during his sickness, attempted to sing
some of the Sunday school hymns, and on the
day of his death, he commenced singing the
hymn,
<q type="verse" direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“There is a fountain filled with blood,</l><l>Drawn from Immanuel's veins,”</l></lg></q>
which he had learned from the S. S. Harp,
but being unable, from shortness of breath, to
accomplish it, Mr. Perkins assisted him, and
thus together they sung several verses, Griswold
joining in as well as he could. A few hours
before his death, Mr. Perkins asked him what he
would wish to say to his father. He replied,
“Bless the Lord, O my father; honor and
worship him forever. Cast away all your idols,
and worship him alone.” After this, he seemed
to gather up all his remaining strength, and
<pb id="griswold14" n="14"/>
prayed aloud and distinctly for his parents, all
his friends in Africa, teachers and scholars of
the mission schools, that God would have mercy
on them; he alluded to the justice of God in
condemning the wicked, and expressed his
thankfulness that God so loved the world as to
give his only begotten Son that he might “save
them from the worm that dieth not, and the fire
that is not quenched.” He then repeated with
great solemnity and unusual distinctness—and
it was the last sentence he uttered—“The grace
of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God,
and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost, be with us
all evermore. Amen.”</p>
        <p>This was about ten o'clock at night, and, for
an hour after, he occasionally attempted to sing
a hymn, but was only able to make out a few
notes. During the remaining hour of his life, he
was in a dying state, but apparently free from
conscious suffering; and just before twelve he
quietly slept the sleep of death, and who can
doubt that angels stood ready to transport the
<pb id="griswold15" n="15"/>
soul of our departed brother to the realms of
bliss and glory. When we consider how many
there are, who, amid the full blaze of gospel
light, neglect the care of their souls and a proper
preparation for eternity, we cannot but be
reminded, by the foregoing narrative, of these
words of our Saviour: “I say unto you that
many shall come from the east and from the
west, and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac
and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, but the
children of the kingdom shall be cast out into
outer darkness.” “Unto whom much is given,
of them shall much be required.”</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="text">
        <p>The following hymn, which was a great favorite
with Griswold, was, as already noticed, sung
by him on his dying bed:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>There is a fountain filled with blood,</l>
          <l>Drawn from Immanuel's veins,</l>
          <l>And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,</l>
          <l>Lose all their guilty stains.</l>
        </lg>
        <pb id="griswold16" n="16"/>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>The dying thief rejoiced to see</l>
          <l>That fountain in his day;</l>
          <l>And there may I, though vile as he,</l>
          <l>Wash all my sins away. </l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Thou dying Lamb! thy precious blood</l>
          <l>Shall never lose its power,</l>
          <l>Till all the ransomed church of God</l>
          <l>Are saved, to sin no more.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Since first, by faith, I saw the stream,</l>
          <l>Thy flowing wounds supply,</l>
          <l>Redeeming love has been my theme,</l>
          <l>And shall be, till I die.</l>
        </lg>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>And when this feeble, stammering tongue</l>
          <l>Lies silent in the grave—</l>
          <l>Then, in a nobler, sweeter song,</l>
          <l>I'll sing thy power to save.</l>
