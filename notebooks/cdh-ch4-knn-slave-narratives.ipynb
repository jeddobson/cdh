    "# Text Mining DocSouth Slave Narrative Archive\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* This is the first in [a series of documents and notebooks](https://jeddobson.github.io/textmining-docsouth/) that will document and evaluate various machine learning and text mining tools for use in literary studies. These notebooks form the practical and critical archive of my book-in-progress, _Digital Humanities and the Search for a Method_. I have published a critique of some existing methods (Dobson 2015) that takes up some of these concerns and provides some theoretical background for my account of computational methods as used within the humanities. Each notebook displays code, data, results, interpretation, and critique. I attempt to provide as much explanation of the individual steps and documentation (along with citations of related papers) of the concepts and justification of choices made.   \n",

    "- 05/10/2017: Initial version (james.e.dobson@dartmouth.edu)\n",

    "### KNearest Neighbor (kNN) period classification of texts\n",
    "\n",
    "The following Jupyter cells show a very basic classification task using the [kNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm) algorithm as implemented in Python and with the [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/) package.\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple check to see if the dates in the table of contents (\"toc.csv\") for the DocSouth [\"North American Slave Narratives\"](http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/) can be converted to an integer (date as year) is used to assign one of these two classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- antebellum: prior to 1865\n",
    "- postbellum: after 1865 \n",
    "\n",
    "These period categories are rough and by no means not perfect. Publication year may have little relation to the content of the text, the source for the vectorizing process and eventual categorization. These dates are what Matthew Jockers calls, within the digital humanities context, catalog metadata (Jockers 2013, 35-62). Recently, critics have challenged such divisions (Marrs 2015) that are central to the understanding of field of nineteenth-century American literary studies with concepts like \"transbellum\" that might be capable of helping to better understand works that address the Civil War and its attendant anxities through the \"long nineteenth century.\" The majority of the texts included in the DocSouth archive are first-person autobiographical narratives of lives lived during the antebellum and Civil War years and published in the years leading up to, including, and after the war.\n",

    "There are 252 texts with four digit years and eighteen texts with ambiguous or unknown publication dates. This script will attempt to classify these texts into one of these two periods following the \"fitting\" of the labeled training texts. I split the 252 texts with known and certain publication dates into two groups: a training set and a testing test. After \"fitting\" the training set and establishing the neighbors, the code attempts to categorize the testing set. Many questions can and should be asked about the creation of the training set and the labeling of the data. This labeling practice introduces many subjective decisions into what is perceived as an objective (machine and algorithmically generated) process (Dobson 2015, Gillespie 2016).\n",

    "#### Text Pre-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "The texts are all used/imported as found in the zip file provided by the DocSouth [\"North American Slave Narratives\"](http://docsouth.unc.edu/neh/) collection. The texts have been encoded in a combination of UTF-8 Unicode and ASCII. Scikit-learn's HashingVectorizer performs some additional pre-processing and that will be examined in the sections below. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### kNN Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The kNN algorithm is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning that it does not require detailed knowledge of the input data and its distribution (Cover and Hart 1967). This algorithm is known as reliable and it is quite simple, especially when compared to some of the more complex machine learning algorithms used as present, to implement and understand. It was originally conceived of as a response to what is called a “discrimination problem”: the categorization of a large number of input points into discrete \"boxes.\" Data are eventually organized into categories, in the case of this script, the three categories of antebellum, postbellum, and twentieth-century. \n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm functions in space and produces each input text as a \"neighbor\" and has each text \"vote\" for membership into parcellated neighborhoods. Cover and Hart explain: \"If the number of samples is large it makes good sense to use, instead of the single nearest neighbor, the majority vote of the nearest k neighbors\" (22). The following code uses the value of \"12\" for the number of neighbors or the 'k' of kNN.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kNN algorithm may give better results for smaller numbers of classes. The performance of particular implementation of kNN and the feature selection algorithm (HashingVectorizer) was better with just the antebellum and postbellum class. Alternative boundaries for the classes (year markers) might also improve results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Feature Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "While it is non-parametics, the kNN algorithm does require a set of features in order to categorize the input data, the texts. This script operates according to the _\"bag of words\"_ method in which each text is treated not as a narrative but a collection of unordered and otherwise undiferentiated words. This means that multiple word phrases (aka ngrams) are ignored and much meaning will be removed from the comparative method because of a loss of context. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to select the features by which a text can be compared to another, we need some sort of method that can produce numerical data. I have selected the HashingVectorizer, which is a fast method to generate a list of words/tokens from a file. This returns a numpy compressed sparse row (CSR) matrix that scikit-learn will use in the creation of the neighborhood \"map.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "The HashingVectorizer removes a standard 318 English-language stop words and by default does not alter or remove any accents or accented characters in the encoded (UTF-8) format. It also converts all words to lowercase, potentially introducing false positives. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Issues with HashingVectorizer** This vectorizer works well, but it limits the questions we can ask after it has been run. We cannot, for example, interrogate why a certain text might have been misclassified by examining the words/tokens returned by the vectorizer. This is because the HashingVectorizer returns only indices to features and does not keep the string representation of specific words. "
