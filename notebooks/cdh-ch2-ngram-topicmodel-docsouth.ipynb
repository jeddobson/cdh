    "*Note:* This is one in [a series of documents and notebooks](https://jeddobson.github.io/textmining-docsouth/) that will document and evaluate various machine learning and text mining tools for use in literary studies. These notebooks form the practical and critical archive of my book-in-progress, _Digital Humanities and the Search for a Method_. I have published a critique of some existing methods (Dobson 2016) that takes up some of these concerns and provides some theoretical background for my account of computational methods as used within the humanities.\n",
